DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Segretto, is it?
PATIENT: Segretto, yes. Arlan Segretto. Though, honestly, these doctors and their papers… always something to fill out. Makes a fella feel like a… a form himself, you know? And a skinny one at that.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, paperwork is…necessary. So, Mr. Segretto, let's get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this blasted bladder of mine. Going all the time. More than a fella ought to, that’s for sure. It’s…well, it’s just frequent. Very frequent. I wake up at night, too. Used to sleep like a log, I did. Now… now it’s just… going. My wife, bless her heart, she’s getting tired of it.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… and nocturia, waking at night. Anything else associated with it?
PATIENT: Associated with it? Hmm… let me think. Not really… no pain, thankfully. Just… annoying. Very annoying. And weakens a man, having to get up… always going. I don't know about associations... is that what you mean? What kind of associations? Like with what?
DOCTOR: No, not with anything specifically. Just… any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, I feel a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Old age, probably. Though I still manage the farm, mostly. My boy helps now. A good boy, but… doesn't know a thing about proper crop rotation. Don't think that's a symptom, though. Just…life. Is that what you're asking about? Symptoms?
DOCTOR: Fatigue... Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the waterworks? What do you mean? Is it… supposed to look a certain way? I just… go. Don’t really look at it, if you know what I mean. A man has some dignity, you know. It’s… yellow, I think. Usually. Is something wrong with the color? Should I be looking at it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on then. Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not a fever. Chills…well, it gets cold in the house sometimes, the wife likes it that way. Nausea… no, never really get sick to my stomach. Strong as an ox, I was. Still am, mostly. Though getting up all the time does make a fella a little weak. Is that what you're looking for? Something awful?
DOCTOR: Right. And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… hmm. I had the flu once, bad one in '78, I think. And a splinter when I was a boy. The doctor pulled it out with… with something scary. Oh, and my knee acted up a bit when I was younger, playing football. But nothing serious. Nothing they ever had to do much about. Is there something specific you want to know? I don't really go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… no. Never had any surgery. Always prided myself on being healthy enough to avoid those things. My wife, she had her gallbladder out years ago, but I… no. No surgeries. Never needed 'em. Good strong stock, that's what I am. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Family history. Any history of… bladder problems, kidney disease, or anything like that in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father, he had a bit of trouble with… well, with getting old, I suppose. A bit shaky. And my mother, she worried a lot. Worried about everything. Don't recall anyone specifically with… bladder problems, no. Kidney… maybe an uncle? But it was a long time ago, and I wasn't paying much attention then. Are you looking for something specific? My family wasn’t one for talking about such things, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and check your prostate. It's routine.
PATIENT: Prostate? Now hold on a minute. Check my… what? I don’t like the sound of that. What for? Is something wrong? I came in here for my bladder, not… not for that. I don’t think I want anyone poking around there. Is that really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it's a simple exam to rule out any issues that could be contributing to your frequent urination. It's standard procedure. It's not about anything being wrong, it's about being thorough. We can skip it, but it won't give me a complete picture.
PATIENT: Thorough, you say? Look, I don’t trust doctors much. Always poking and prodding. My wife says I worry too much, but… well, a man has his dignity. And poking around there doesn’t sound very dignified, I can tell you that. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just give me something for my bladder? Something to… calm it down? I'd rather avoid all that poking, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. We can proceed without it. However, I must advise that it limits my ability to accurately assess your condition. I will order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. If those results are concerning, we will need to revisit the possibility of a more thorough examination. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… and a… what did you call it? A basic what? Look, I just want something for my bladder. Tests and examinations… it’s too much. I understand you want to be thorough, but I’m an old man. I don’t want to spend all my time running tests. Can you just… give me something? A pill, maybe? Something to stop the frequent going? And I really don't like the sound of having to "revisit" anything. Is that possible? Just a pill?
DOCTOR: Fine, Mr. Segretto. I will write you a prescription for oxybutynin. It’s a medication that can help reduce bladder spasms. However, be aware it has side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation. We will need to monitor your response to the medication. I strongly recommend you follow up with me in two weeks to discuss how you're feeling.
