DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mr. Rover, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, hi Doc. Folks told me to come… somethin’ about insurance? My… my wife, she used to handle all that. Long-term care, I think they said. It’s… been a while. I mostly just move things around, you know? Freight and stuff. Not good with paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Insurance is…important. Though frankly, I'm a physician, not a billing specialist. Let's focus on you, Mr. Rover. “Moving things around”… is that a recent change, this…occupation?
PATIENT: No, no, been doin' it a long time. Since… well, a long time. Before… before my wife got sick. It keeps me busy, I guess. Just…liftin' and carryin'. Not much thinkin’ involved. It’s good for the… the body, mostly. Though it's gettin' harder, I suppose. I don’t remember things as well as I used to.
DOCTOR: “Harder.” Vague, Mr. Rover. We need specifics. Are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. In my back, mostly. And my shoulders. It comes and goes, ya know? Like… after a long day, or if I lift somethin’ real heavy. It's not… sharp, usually. Just… aches. Old aches. I just… rub it and it usually goes away. Or I take somethin'… I forget what it’s called. Little white pill.
DOCTOR: A "little white pill," of course. Well. Let's attempt a proper history. When did this back and shoulder discomfort begin?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… that’s… a good question. A long time ago, I reckon. Before… before my wife… maybe a couple years before? It wasn't bad then, just a little stiffness. It got worse after… after she needed more help. I started liftin' her a lot, you know? Movin’ her around. It’s… hard to say exactly. Things kinda blur together after a while.
DOCTOR: “Blur together.” Yes, I gather. Do you have any difficulty with… everyday activities?
PATIENT: Everyday things? Like… walkin’? No, I walk fine. Cookin’? I manage, mostly. Simple stuff. I can get around, ya know? It just… takes a little longer sometimes. And I gotta be careful liftin' things, even groceries. I drop stuff now and then. Mostly just… small stuff. But it's happenin' more lately, I think. My hands get kinda… shaky sometimes too. Not all the time, just when I’m tired.
DOCTOR: “Shaky.” Are these tremors constant, or intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter… intermitt-ent? Oh. They come and go. Not always there. Mostly when I haven't slept good. Or after I’ve been workin’ hard all day. It’s not… bad enough to bother anyone, usually. Just… noticeable, I guess. Makes it hard to… button my shirt sometimes. Little things. My wife used to help with that, before… well. I mostly wear these overalls now, easier to get on.
DOCTOR: Overalls. Very practical, I suppose. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness…? Not… not really. I feel tired, ya know? After a long day. But weakness… no. I can still lift things, still get around. Maybe not as fast as I used to, but… I can do what I need to do. I just… get outta breath easier now. Especially if I’m walkin’ uphill. Or carryin’ somethin’ heavy. It just… takes longer to recover. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: We'll proceed to a brief physical examination, Mr. Rover. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to assess your range of motion and reflexes. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, sure. Examination table, right. This ain’t as easy as it used to be, Doc. Bones ain't what they used to be, I guess. Just let me know what ya want me to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Mr. Rover. I will begin with your upper extremities. Any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: A little… yeah, a little somethin’ in my shoulder there. Not sharp, just… a pullin’ kinda feelin’. It’s always been a little tight, ya know? But it’s… a bit more noticeable today, I guess. Feels like somethin's… stuck. It’ll probably loosen up after a bit. I just gotta get it movin'.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah… that’s a bit tender. Not terrible, but… yeah, right there. It’s been achin’ for a while, like I said. It gets worse if I bend over. Or twist. Mostly just a dull ache. It's…always there, kinda. Like a shadow.
DOCTOR: Now, please bend your knees and keep your legs relaxed. I will test your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yeah… that feels…normal. I think. Always been a little jumpy. My wife used to tease me about it. Said I had… twitchy legs. I don't know… feels the same as always, I guess. Not much to it.
DOCTOR: Very well. It seems you have some degree of musculoskeletal discomfort and some mild reflexes. It’s likely related to your occupation and age, Mr. Rover. We can discuss some pain management options, if you wish. Or you can see a physical therapist. Frankly, I do not see a need for extensive investigation at this time. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Pain management…? Oh. Well… I don't know. I just came 'cause they told me to, for the insurance. I don't want no fancy stuff, Doc. Just… want to know if I'm gonna fall apart or somethin'. Is it…serious? Will I be able to keep workin’? That's all I really care about.
DOCTOR: "Fall apart," Mr. Rover, is a rather alarmist term. You are experiencing typical wear and tear. Your age and occupation are contributing factors. I do not foresee any immediate catastrophic event. However, continued heavy lifting will exacerbate your symptoms. I recommend limiting strenuous activity and consider a referral to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. As for medication, we can discuss a short course of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, but I strongly advise against long-term use. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Non-steroidal… anti-inflam… right. So… you're sayin' it's just old age catchin' up? And I gotta be careful liftin’ stuff? I don’t really understand all that fancy talk, Doc. I just… move things. That’s what I do. Physical therapy… that’s gonna cost money, right? And time… I kinda need to keep workin’. Is there… anything else I can do? Just to… keep goin’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, I have other patients awaiting consultation. You can attempt over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, but do not exceed the recommended dosage. And I strongly suggest you explore the possibility of modifying your workload. I cannot offer any further magical solutions. Here is a prescription for a short course of naproxen. And I will provide a referral for physical therapy, though the financial burden is, unfortunately, your responsibility. Do you have any other questions, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Naproxen… okay. I guess… no. No other questions. Just… thank you, Doc. I guess. I'll… try to take it easy. And see about that physical therapy. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. "Patient presents with age-related musculoskeletal complaints… vague history… likely occupation-related… prescribed naproxen… referral for physical therapy… discharge instructions given." .
