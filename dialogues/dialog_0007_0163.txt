DOCTOR: Hi Jarvis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, it’s rather…embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve been dabbling – rather foolishly, I now realise – in some rather extreme diets. My daughter suggested I have a proper review before I do any further damage. It all began with this… cabbage soup business.
DOCTOR: Okay, cabbage soup… I see. It's good you're being proactive about this, and definitely smart of your daughter to suggest a check-up. No judgement here – we all try different things! So, tell me more about this “cabbage soup business.” How long were you on it, and what exactly did it involve?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t just cabbage soup, you understand. Though that was the mainstay, naturally. It was… seven days, I believe. Seven days of almost exclusively cabbage soup, with a tiny allowance for a few other vegetables. Green beans, carrots… nothing substantial, I assure you. And a small amount of broth. Really, it was quite miserable. Afterwards, I attempted a rather restrictive fruit-only plan… but that lasted even less time. I began to feel quite faint, you see.
DOCTOR: Seven days of mostly cabbage soup, then a brief foray into fruit-only… and you started feeling faint after that. Okay. And how long ago was the fruit-only diet?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… the fruit-only was… approximately three weeks ago, I’d say. Yes, three weeks. It was a dreadful mistake. I’ve always been rather… disciplined, you see, and I thought I could just will myself to be healthy. My daughter, bless her heart, pointed out that discipline and starvation are not necessarily the same thing. She’s a very sensible girl. Perhaps too sensible for her own good.
DOCTOR: She sounds like a good daughter, Jarvis. And she's right to be concerned. It's great you're recognizing this wasn't the best approach. So, aside from the faintness, have you experienced anything else since stopping these diets?
PATIENT: Well, my energy levels are rather… low, generally. I tire quite easily. And I’ve been experiencing a bit of… digestive upset, shall we say? Nothing terribly dramatic, but… irregular. And my hands, I’ve noticed, have been trembling a little. I put it down to too much coffee, initially, but now I’m beginning to wonder… It’s all rather unsettling, to be honest. I’ve always prided myself on my good health.
DOCTOR: Okay, low energy, digestive issues, and some hand tremors. That's good information. It could be related to these diets, absolutely. Before we go further, just to get a complete picture, have you had any changes in your weight recently – either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I lost… oh, approximately eight pounds during the cabbage soup diet. A rather alarming rate, in retrospect. And then, predictably, I gained most of it back – perhaps six pounds – in the weeks following, as I resumed something resembling a normal eating pattern. I haven’t weighed myself since, if I’m quite honest. The whole process has left me rather…disheartened, and I prefer to avoid the scale at present.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight pounds lost quickly, then regained some. That’s helpful to know. And it’s perfectly understandable you’d want to avoid the scale right now. Just to cover all bases, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid the need for prescription medications. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, perhaps, but nothing regular. I do take a multivitamin, of course, but that’s about it. And I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’ve always been rather…robust, constitutionally speaking. Though, clearly, my recent dietary adventures have taken a toll.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no allergies, just a multivitamin. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. By all means, proceed. I understand the necessity of a thorough examination. Though I confess, I’ve always been a bit squeamish about medical instruments. But I shall endeavour to remain stoic.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. And while I'm doing that, can you tell me a little about your typical daily diet before these recent diets?
PATIENT: Certainly. Before this… regrettable experimentation, my diet was rather traditional, I suppose. A good English breakfast most mornings – eggs, bacon, toast, the usual. Though I’ve cut back on the bacon somewhat in recent years, at my daughter’s insistence. Lunch would typically be a sandwich, perhaps a ploughman’s with cheese and pickles. And dinner… well, dinner varied. Roast chicken on Sundays, fish and chips occasionally, a steak, perhaps. I’ve always enjoyed a good roast, you see. And I do have a fondness for puddings.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your hands are a little cold, and I'm noting some slight tremor as you sit there. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not overly concerning. Given your recent history of restrictive dieting, the weight loss and regain, and these findings, I'm suspecting a possible electrolyte imbalance or vitamin deficiency. It's also important to rule out other potential causes for the tremors. I'd like to order some blood work. It'll give us a clearer picture of your electrolyte levels, vitamin status, and thyroid function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds entirely sensible. Blood work seems a prudent course of action. I confess, I suspected as much. My daughter, a rather resourceful individual, has already begun researching the potential consequences of such… ill-advised diets. She's quite convinced that my potassium levels are depleted, if I recall correctly. I shall defer to your professional judgment, of course.
DOCTOR: Your daughter sounds very informed. Potassium is definitely something we'll check, along with a full panel. I'll write up the requisition now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take the sample right away. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a well-balanced diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And perhaps avoid any further extreme dieting until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. A well-balanced diet… a sensible recommendation, indeed. And I assure you, I shall resist the temptation of any further cabbage soup or fruit-only regimes. I’ve learned my lesson, I think. Although… do you think a small piece of Victoria sponge cake would be entirely out of the question? For medicinal purposes, naturally. To restore my energy levels, you understand.
DOCTOR: For medicinal purposes, absolutely. A small piece of Victoria sponge cake sounds perfectly reasonable. In fact, I might even prescribe it. Just don't tell your daughter! We'll follow up once the lab results are back, and we can discuss a long-term plan to get you back to feeling your best. Here's the requisition for the lab, and a note for your primary care physician summarizing our consultation. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you for thinking of that. The lab is conveniently located, just a short walk from here. I am perfectly capable of navigating the journey on my own. And I shall inform my daughter of your… endorsement of the Victoria sponge. She may protest, but I believe she will ultimately approve. I am most grateful for your thorough examination and sensible advice. You have put my mind at ease considerably.
