DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit…difficult to explain. I’ve been having some trouble with my speech, it seems. It’s like…the words don’t come out quite right. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s gotten more noticeable recently, I think. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning, and you're right to get it checked out. It’s perfectly alright that you can’t pinpoint the exact start date; these things often develop gradually. Can you describe what you mean by “not coming out quite right”?
PATIENT: Hmm…it’s hard to say. Sometimes it feels like my tongue is too heavy, you know? And other times…the words just get…muddled. Like I’m trying to say something, but it comes out slurred. It’s not all the time, though. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine, and then other times…like today, it’s a bit worse. My husband noticed it first, actually. He kept asking me to repeat myself. I don’t…I don’t really know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Adyn. You’re describing it very clearly. It sounds like there’s some variability in the difficulty, which is helpful information. The slurring and the feeling of a heavy tongue are particularly noteworthy. To help me understand a little better, has this been affecting your ability to eat or swallow?
PATIENT: Eat…swallow… Not that I've noticed, not really. I mean, I haven’t been avoiding any foods or anything. Everything goes down okay, I think. My husband does ask if I’m having trouble sometimes, but I usually tell him I’m fine, and I am! I just… maybe I take my time a little more when I eat? It’s hard to say, really. I don't usually pay attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no difficulties with swallowing currently, and no intentional changes to your diet. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the speech difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… I've been a little tired lately, I suppose. But honestly, who isn’t tired? Work’s been busy. Construction Management is…demanding. And maybe a little bit of dizziness sometimes, but nothing major. Just a fleeting feeling, really. It doesn’t last long. I’m not sure if that's connected, though. It could just be from being on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional dizziness. It’s good you’re mentioning these, even if they seem minor. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, any changes in your vision, or any headaches associated with this?
PATIENT: Weakness…no, not really. I lift heavy things all day at work, so my arms are usually pretty tired, but not weak. Vision… I haven’t noticed anything different. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. Headaches… sometimes, yes. But just regular headaches. Nothing terrible, and I usually take something for them and they go away. They’re not always related to the speech, I don’t think. Honestly, I get headaches a lot. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I? It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Adyn. You’re providing valuable information, and it’s perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering everything. We’ll take our time. Now, let's move on to some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I have Medicare, so I must have something…but I don't really know what. My husband handles most of the paperwork, honestly. I haven't been to the doctor much in the last few years. I don't think I have anything major. No diabetes, no heart problems… at least, I’ve never been told I do. Would my husband’s information be helpful?
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can certainly look up your records. I do have access to your EHR here. Okay… it appears you have a documented history of mild childhood asthma, which resolved several years ago. Otherwise, everything seems relatively clear. No major medical conditions listed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Childhood asthma… yes, I remember that vaguely. I outgrew it, thankfully. Surgeries… no, I don't think so. I definitely haven't had any major surgeries. Hospitalized…? I think I was in the hospital once when I was very young, with a bad fever, but that was a long time ago. It wasn’t anything serious, as far as I remember. Just…a childhood illness, I suppose. Nothing in recent years, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, resolved childhood asthma, a possible childhood hospitalization for a fever, and no recent surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had…something with her heart, I think. My husband says she had a bad heart, but I don't really remember the details. And my uncle… he had high blood pressure, I think. It’s hard to say, honestly. We don’t really talk about these things much. There’s a lot of family in Jamaica, and it’s hard to keep track of everyone’s health problems from so far away. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's common to not have a complete picture of family history. A history of heart problems in your grandmother and high blood pressure in your uncle are helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine on special occasions, but that's it. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I work too hard to jeopardize my health like that. My husband doesn't drink much either. He has a glass of beer sometimes, with dinner. But nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to medications in the past, as far as I remember. I’m not allergic to any foods, either. Oh! Wait… I think I got a rash once, after using a new laundry detergent, but that wasn't a serious allergy, just a bit of irritation. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a mild rash from laundry detergent doesn’t count as a medication or food allergy. So, no known drug or food allergies. Okay, Adyn, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. What kind of exam will you be doing?
DOCTOR: I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, nose, and throat, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. I’ll also briefly assess your tongue and the muscles in your face. It won’t be anything uncomfortable. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. 135 over 82. Not bad. Now, let me listen to your heart… Sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Now, your lungs… Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Alright. Everything sounds okay so far, thankfully. It’s just… I get a little anxious at the doctor sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s very common. I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, let me take a look at your ears… Ears appear clear. Now, your nose and throat… Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, let's quickly check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Excellent. And can you please say "hello"?
PATIENT: Hello. Hello? It feels…a little strange to say it. Is everything alright? I don’t know… my speech feels a bit…slurred again.
DOCTOR: You’re right. I do notice a subtle slurring when you say “hello” compared to earlier. Now, let’s stick your tongue out for me. Okay. It appears slightly asymmetrical, with a little bit of fasciculation on the left side. It's subtle, but noticeable. Adyn, based on what you've told me and my initial exam findings – the subtle slurring, the occasional tongue heaviness, and now the slight asymmetry and fasciculation – I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue affecting your speech muscles. It's too early to be certain, but it warrants further investigation. I want to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… A neurological issue…? What…what does that mean? Is it…serious? I just came in because my speech was a little slurred, I didn’t think it was anything major! What if it’s… something terrible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear something like this. It's important to remember that an MRI is just a tool to help us get more information, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there is something serious. Many things can cause subtle speech changes, and we need to rule out potential causes. Possible causes can range from something benign like a minor inflammation, to something more significant. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. We will determine the cause, and create a plan. I want to be upfront; some potential causes, although less likely, could require more extensive treatment. However, many speech issues are manageable with therapy. We can discuss this further after the MRI results come in. For now, let’s schedule the MRI. I’m going to give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Ramirez, who specializes in speech disorders. She will review the results and discuss treatment options if necessary. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A neurologist…Dr. Ramirez… Will the MRI…will it hurt? I’ve never had one before. And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I don’t want to wait for weeks and be worried the whole time. And what if it is something bad? What then?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be worried, and it's good you're asking these questions. The MRI itself is painless. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a little loud, so you’ll be given earplugs or headphones. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the results, it typically takes a few days to a week for the radiologist to analyze the images and send a report to Dr. Ramirez. She will then schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the findings and create a plan. We will schedule you an appointment to talk about the results after. And if it is something that requires treatment, we will address it together. Dr. Ramirez is excellent and will thoroughly explain all your options. We’ll focus on managing the condition and improving your speech. We can talk about speech therapy, medication if necessary, and any other support you may need. It’s important to remember that many people live full and productive lives with speech disorders. We're here to help you through this every step of the way. Here’s the referral to Dr. Ramirez. The form has her contact information and details about scheduling an appointment. Do you want me to help you schedule an appointment now, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you so much, Doctor. Could you… could you help me schedule an appointment now? I don’t think I can do it myself right now. I’m just… too overwhelmed. And… could you maybe tell me a little more about Dr. Ramirez? What kind of experience does she have with speech issues like mine?
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Let me see… Dr. Ramirez is a board-certified neurologist with over 15 years of experience specializing in movement and speech disorders. She has a strong reputation for being very thorough and compassionate. She's affiliated with Suburban General Hospital and has published several research papers on speech therapy techniques. She works with a variety of speech issues, including those caused by stroke, neurological conditions, and muscle weakness, and has extensive experience with patients presenting with subtle speech changes like yours. Okay, she has an opening on August 12th at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: August 12th… yes, that would be fine. Thank you so much for scheduling that for me, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I should do before my appointment with Dr. Ramirez? Should I bring anything with me? I just want to be prepared. This is all so scary.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s perfectly alright to be scared, and I’m here to help you through this. For your appointment with Dr. Ramirez, it’s helpful to bring a list of any medications you’re taking, as well as any relevant medical records you have. It might also be helpful to write down a list of your specific concerns and questions beforehand, so you don’t forget anything. And if you have any family members or friends who can accompany you, that can be helpful too. Most importantly, try not to worry too much. We're going to figure this out together. We have scheduled your MRI and neurology appointments, and after this, we will monitor for any additional symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you so much for everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate your help. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. I think I’m ready to go home now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I’ll see you on August 12th. Please call the clinic if there are any changes. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
