DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for, you know… the HIV thing. I just want to be sure, alright? It's better to know, I always say. Don’t want any surprises later on.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It’s very responsible of you to want to get tested and be proactive about your health. No surprises is a good motto. We can absolutely do that for you today. Just to be clear, are you requesting an HIV test due to any specific reason, or is this part of a routine check-up?
PATIENT: Routine check-up? No, not exactly. It’s just… well, my wife and I, we’ve been… active. And I like to be careful. Some people are just… less careful than others, you know? It's not like I think anything's wrong, but you can't be too safe, can you? It's just sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you're requesting testing due to recent changes in sexual activity and wanting to ensure your health and your wife’s health. That’s perfectly reasonable. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this activity?
PATIENT: Ugh, do I have to? Look, it’s… private, alright? It’s not like I’m going to detail everything for a doctor. It’s just… we've met a few new people. That’s all you need to know. It’s not like I’m doing anything wrong, I just want to be cautious. Is that enough information for you, or do you need a full life story? Honestly, it feels a bit intrusive asking this.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Belan, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. It’s not my intention to pry, but a few more details do help me assess your risk level and ensure we choose the appropriate testing methods and timeline. Knowing if these encounters were protected, and roughly when they occurred, would be helpful. We can keep it general, I assure you. Protected meaning consistent condom use, every time. And "roughly when" could be within the last 3 months, 6 months, a year?
PATIENT: Right, okay. Look, most of the time, yes, we use protection. Mostly. Sometimes things… happen. It’s not like we plan for it to not be, alright? And… I guess it's been within the last six months. Maybe a little longer with one encounter. Honestly, keeping track is… difficult. It’s not like I’m making a spreadsheet of it. I just want the test, alright? Are we getting closer to that, or are we going to dissect my personal life all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan. I appreciate your honesty. "Mostly" protected encounters within the last six months does put you at some risk, and we will proceed with testing accordingly. We'll do a standard HIV antibody test today. It's a blood draw. It typically takes a week to get the results back. Now, I also want to discuss other sexually transmitted infections, or STIs. Would you be interested in getting tested for those as well?
PATIENT: Look, honestly? No. I just want the HIV test. I don’t want to open a whole can of worms. I'm not feeling sick, I don't have any symptoms, and frankly, I don’t need to worry about every single possible thing. It's just… overkill. One thing at a time, alright? I’m here for the HIV test, and I’d like to just get that done. Are there any other questions you need to ask before we do that? Because I'm starting to get a bit impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I respect your decision. We can absolutely proceed with just the HIV test. Just to confirm, you're not experiencing any fever, fatigue, rash, muscle aches, or swollen lymph nodes?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I feel perfectly fine. A little stressed now, maybe, from all the questions, but otherwise healthy. Can we please just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Then let's proceed with the blood draw. My nurse, Maria, will be right in to take you to the lab. She’ll explain the process and answer any questions you have. It’s a quick procedure. After the blood draw, she’ll let me know, and we’ll discuss the results in about a week. Do you have any questions for me before we do that?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done quickly, alright? I really don't like needles. And please, tell Maria to be gentle. That's all I ask. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I’ll let Maria know. She’s very experienced and gentle. I’ll be in touch next week with your results. Please let me know if you develop any flu-like symptoms before then. Thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: .
