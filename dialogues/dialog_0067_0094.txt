DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Good morning. I… think it’s something about… learning? My husband said I need to learn some things. Something about… staying healthy, maybe? I don't really remember what he said. He just told me to come here.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your husband is looking out for you and wants to make sure you’re taking good care of yourself. We can definitely talk about staying healthy today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Me? Uh… not much. I work. Sheet metal. It’s… hard work. Lots of bending and cutting. My back… sometimes hurts. But it always hurts, so… I don't know. Is that important? I don't get sick much, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That is important, Airam. Sheet metal work sounds physically demanding, and it's good you're generally healthy. Let’s focus on this back pain for a bit. You said it “always hurts.” Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Always… like a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not sudden. Just… there. Especially after a long day at work. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little bit, but not all the way. I just… take some pills. Whatever my neighbor gave me. I don't remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, and sometimes radiates down your legs. That gives me a better idea. And you take pills given to you by a neighbor?
PATIENT: Yeah. She said they were good for aches. Better than nothing, I guess. I don't like going to doctors much. Too many questions. And waiting. And… I don’t know, I just feel silly complaining about my back. Everyone aches when they work hard. It's just… life.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Airam. It is important to talk about things that bother you, even if they seem like just “life.” And it’s good you’re being honest about taking medication from a neighbor. We need to make sure whatever you’re taking is safe, and that it’s not masking something we should be looking into more closely. To help me understand what’s going on with your back, could you tell me a little more about what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… bending, definitely. Lifting heavy things. Sometimes even just standing for too long. And… when it's cold. Cold weather makes it stiff. I try to stretch, but… it doesn’t always help. My husband says I should be more careful, but… it's hard when you have a job to do.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So bending, lifting, prolonged standing, and cold weather aggravate the pain. Stretching helps sometimes, but not always. I understand it’s difficult to be careful when you have a job to do. Before we move on, I'd like to ask about any numbness, weakness, or tingling in your legs or feet. Have you noticed anything like that?
PATIENT: Huh. Numbness… not really. Sometimes my feet feel… tired at the end of the day. But that’s normal, right? From standing all day. Weakness… no, I can still walk and everything. Tingling… maybe a little bit in my toes sometimes, but it goes away. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… a feeling. Like they’re asleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue in your feet, and occasional tingling—like they're "asleep"—in your toes. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. My husband always says I’m healthy as a horse. But I get… headaches sometimes. And… I’m a little bit overweight, I guess. But that’s just from eating. I like to eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, occasional headaches, and you’d describe yourself as a little overweight. That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re aware of these things. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has back problems, arthritis, or other health issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… something with her hands. Arthritis, maybe? They were always swollen and painful. And my grandfather… he had a bad back. He used to complain all the time. He was a farmer, very hard work. That's all I really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis and back problems, which is good information to have. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the pills your neighbor gave you?
PATIENT: Uhm… just the pills. I think they’re… white? Small, round pills. I don’t know what they are, really. And… sometimes I take something for my headaches, if they’re really bad. Just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, maybe? I forget. It’s in the kitchen cabinet somewhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some white pills of unknown origin, and occasional ibuprofen for headaches. That's good to know. It's important that we identify what you're taking. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work tomorrow. What are you going to do? Poke me and prod me?
DOCTOR: Something like that, Airam. It won’t be painful, I promise. I just want to check your range of motion, strength, and reflexes to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your back. We’ll start with you standing and I’ll ask you to bend forward, backward, and side to side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… be quick about it. And don't make me bend too far. My back… you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll go at your pace, and I’ll stop immediately if you feel any pain. Okay, Airam, I'm just feeling along your spine. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ouch! There… a little bit. Right there. Near the bottom of my back. It's always a little tender there. Like a knot. But it doesn't usually hurt this much when someone touches it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel a bit of muscle tenderness there. It sounds like you're experiencing some muscle spasms. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward slowly, keeping your knees slightly bent. Just go as far as you comfortably can. I'm watching to see how easily you move and where you feel discomfort. Okay, stop there. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… uncomfortable. It feels tight. Like something’s pulling. And it hurts a little bit when I go further. Not terrible, just… annoying. And… my legs are starting to feel a little shaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s enough for now. That tightness and discomfort when bending forward is a significant finding. And it's good you let me know your legs feel shaky. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing. Okay, your reflexes are good, but I noticed a little bit of weakness in your left calf muscle. It’s subtle, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Weakness? What does that mean? Am I… sick? I don’t feel sick. Just tired. And my back hurts. Is it something serious? I don't like this.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Airam. The weakness is mild, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be related to the muscle spasms in your back, or it could be something else. That’s what we need to figure out. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain. The mild weakness in your left calf muscle is something we should investigate further to rule out any nerve involvement. To help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging—an X-ray of your lower back—to see if there are any structural issues. We'll also do some bloodwork to rule out any other underlying conditions. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before ordering those tests?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… I don't think so. Maybe… a little bit itchy when I eat shrimp. But that’s just sometimes. And I hate needles. Do I have to get bloodwork? Can't you just tell me what's wrong without poking me?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the bloodwork, Airam. It's not the most pleasant thing. However, the bloodwork is a useful tool to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, such as inflammation or vitamin deficiencies. It will give us a more complete picture and help me determine the best course of treatment. The shrimp allergy is good to know, too – we will make sure the lab is aware of that. The imaging – the X-ray – will show us if there's any problem with the bones in your back. The bloodwork will tell us about what's going on inside your body. Both tests will help me make a more accurate diagnosis. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But make it quick. And don't use big words. I don't understand doctor talk. What are we looking for exactly? And... will it cost a lot of money? I don't have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll keep it simple. The X-ray is like a picture of your bones. It will show us if there are any cracks, arthritis, or anything else that could be causing your back pain. The bloodwork is a sample of your blood that we send to a lab. They check it for things like inflammation, vitamin levels, and other signs of illness. As for the cost, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, I don’t know the exact price, as it depends on your insurance coverage. However, our billing department can provide you with a cost estimate before the tests are performed. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. Would you like me to have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the X-ray for you?
PATIENT: I… don't have insurance. I told you that already, didn't I? My husband… he was supposed to get me some, but… things are complicated right now. So… how much will it cost? Just give me a number. If it's too much, I can't do it.
DOCTOR: You’re right, you did mention not being insured. My apologies for not being more attentive. Okay. Let me be upfront. An X-ray can cost around $200-$400 without insurance, and the bloodwork could be another $100-$200, depending on the tests we order. It’s not cheap, I understand. However, I don't want cost to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. We do have a few options. We can discuss ordering only the most essential tests to start, which would lower the cost. I can also connect you with resources in the area that offer financial assistance for medical care. There are some programs designed to help patients who are uninsured or underinsured. Would you like me to put you in touch with the billing department now to discuss payment options?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is just… a mess. Okay. Yes. Talk to the billing people. See what they can do. Maybe just the X-ray. I can’t afford all that. And… can they tell me how long it will take? I have to go back to work, you know. I can’t just take time off whenever I want. And… is there anything I can do right now? To make it feel better? My back is still aching.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam. Let me get the billing department on the phone for you now, and they can discuss payment options and answer your questions about the cost and timing. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage the pain. I recommend applying a warm compress or ice pack to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help reduce inflammation and discomfort, but if you’re able to, we'll need to confirm these don’t interact with anything else you're currently taking. It’s also important to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. Gentle stretching and walking can help loosen up your muscles, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. Let me see if I can arrange for the nurse to come in and show you some simple stretches while we wait for the billing department. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Stretches… fine. But make it quick. And don't make me bend over too much. This is just… a lot. And… are you sure the billing people can help? My husband… he always says things are going to be okay, but then they never are.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. It’s okay to feel skeptical, especially if you’ve had difficult experiences in the past. I can assure you that our billing department is experienced in working with uninsured patients, and they’ll do their best to find a solution that works for you. Let me call for the nurse now, and she’ll come in and show you some gentle stretches that won’t put too much strain on your back. I'll stay here with you while she does. “Hi, Sarah?
PATIENT: Okay… Thank you. I guess.
