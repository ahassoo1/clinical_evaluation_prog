DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, something always seems to be going on. So, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's not somethin' I want to be here for, let me tell you. It’s… they keep botherin’ me about… somethin’. Some young folks wantin’ me to let ‘em poke and prod. Honestly, at my age, you’d think they’d understand. A body's had enough pokin' and proddin' in a lifetime, wouldn't you say? It's just... unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. Unnecessary fuss. Look, Wynell, I understand you're not thrilled about tests. But these "young folks," as you call them, are likely trying to do their jobs and make sure you're…well, still ticking along. And at 83, preventative care is especially important. Now, can you tell me specifically what they’re trying to do?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's all a blur. Somethin' about my feet, I think. They keep talkin' about… scans? And lookin' at the nerves. I don’t even feel nothin' wrong with my feet! A little ache here and there, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? I've been a podiatrist for… Lord, I don’t even remember how long. I know feet. They don’t need to be messin' with 'em now. It's just... a waste of good money, if you ask me. And all that waitin’ around… I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: You were a podiatrist?
PATIENT: Yes! Well, I was. Years ago. Before… things. Before my husband… never mind. It's been a long time. A very long time. Doesn't mean I want strangers fiddling with my feet now, does it? I know what good foot care looks like. I spent my life tellin' people what good foot care looks like! And frankly, I think this whole thing is… a bit much. They keep talkin' about 'potential issues' and 'early detection.' Honestly, sounds like they're tryin' to scare an old woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re a retired podiatrist who is now being told by…who, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… that new doctor, Dr. Ramirez. And the nurse, bless her heart, she’s always tryin’ to be helpful. They both keep goin’ on about it. Said somethin’ about… Medicare covers it, so I should just get it done. Honestly, sounds like they're gettin’ a kickback or somethin’. A body can't trust anyone these days. And I told them I don't need no scans! I can tell you everything that’s goin’ on with my feet just by lookin’ at 'em. Years of practice, you know. Years.
DOCTOR: Right. Dr. Ramirez. And you’re declining a nerve conduction study and a foot scan… primarily because you, a retired podiatrist, believe you don't need them. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it like that… it sounds a bit stubborn, doesn't it? But yes. That’s… pretty much it. I just don’t see the point. I feel fine. A little tired, a little achy, but that's just… life. And I don't like bein’ poked and prodded. It's undignified! A body deserves some peace and quiet in its old age. And honestly, all this fuss over nothin'… it feels like they’re talkin’ at me, not to me. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Look, Wynell, I see your point. You’re a professional, you know your body…but even professionals need check-ups. And Medicare covering it isn’t a kickback; it’s preventative care. Now, Dr. Ramirez flagged some concerns about peripheral neuropathy – nerve damage. It can cause numbness, tingling, pain…and if left untreated, it can lead to serious problems. It's a common issue in patients your age, especially with…well, certain medical histories. Let's just do a quick exam of your feet. I’ll take a look, check your reflexes, maybe do a simple balance test. No scans, no prodding. Just a quick assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Balance test? Oh, goodness. I am a bit unsteady on my feet these days, I’ll admit. But that's just 'cause I'm old! It's not… neuropathy or whatever you said. Honestly, I don’t like the sound of that. Sounds… serious. And I don’t want serious. I suppose… a quick look won’t hurt. But no prodding! And if you find somethin’ wrong, you have to explain it to me in plain English. None of that medical jargon. Understand? And don’t try to scare me into anythin'. I've lived a long life, and I'm not afraid of dyin', but I am afraid of bein' treated like a child.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. No prodding, plain English, and no treating you like a child. Fair enough. Let's start with a quick visual exam. Please take off your shoes and socks. Then we’ll check your reflexes and do a simple balance test – just hold still for a few seconds. I just need to get a baseline. We’ll go from there. Now, have you noticed any changes in your feet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. These old bones don’t move like they used to. Changes? Well, they ache a bit more, I suppose. And they feel… wider. I used to have such nice, narrow feet. Now they’re just… spread out. And the skin is so dry, it feels like sandpaper. It’s just old age, dear. That’s all. Don't expect miracles, now. I’ve walked a lot of miles in my lifetime. A lot of miles. And I haven't always had the best shoes.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean about the dryness. And yes, your feet have widened a bit. Your pulses are…weak, but present. I’m also noticing some slight discoloration on your little toe…and a calloused area here on the ball of your foot. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. I’ll lightly touch your feet with this… filament. Tell me when you feel it. And then I’ll use this tuning fork to check your reflexes. It won’t hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Filament? Tuning fork? Honestly, you're makin' me nervous now. It sounds like you're preparin' for somethin' terrible. Just be gentle, dear. And please, explain what you're doin' as you go along. I don't like surprises. And if it starts to hurt, I want you to stop immediately. Understand? I have a very low tolerance for pain these days. A very low tolerance indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I understand. I'm just checking your sensation – to see if you can feel light touch. This filament is very gentle. I'll start here on your big toe… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. No, I don’t think so. It feels… vaguely tingly, maybe. But not like a proper feelin'. It’s just… numbness, I suppose. Like when your foot falls asleep. But it’s not like a sudden sleepiness, it’s more… constant. Does that make sense? I knew somethin' wasn’t right. I've been feelin' a bit… disconnected from my feet lately. Like they don’t quite belong to me. Honestly, it's a bit scary.
DOCTOR: Okay. And here?
PATIENT: No, still nothin'. Just that tingly numbness. It's… strange. I used to be able to feel everything. Every little pebble, every wrinkle in my sock. Now… it's like there's a veil over my feet. Honestly, dear, this isn’t good, is it? I knew I should have listened to my gut. I knew somethin' was wrong. I’ve been tryin’ to ignore it, hopin' it would go away, but… it hasn’t. It's just gotten worse. What does this mean? Am I dyin'? Don't tell me I have to lose a foot! I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: Wynell, please don’t panic. You are not dying, and you are not losing a foot. However, the results of this quick exam are concerning. You have significantly reduced sensation in both feet. This is consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Now, there are many causes of neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and certain medications. Because of your age and medical history, it’s important we investigate this further. I want to order some blood work – to check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and kidney function. I also want to schedule a nerve conduction study – to assess the extent of the nerve damage. And I recommend a consultation with a podiatrist – someone who specializes in foot care. I'll get that referral started right away. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes and develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. We'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, goodness. My mother had diabetes. It was… not a pretty sight. And blood work? I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. A nerve conduction study… is that more pokin’ and proddin’? Honestly, I feel like you're tryin’ to scare me. And another doctor? I already have enough doctors! It's just… too much. Can't we just… do somethin’ else? Can't you just give me a pill or somethin'? I don’t want all these tests. I just want to be left alone. Is that too much to ask? I've lived a long life, dear. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: Wynell, I understand your concerns. And I assure you, I’m not trying to scare you. I know these tests can be unpleasant, and I wouldn't recommend them if they weren't necessary. But ignoring this issue won’t make it go away. In fact, it could lead to serious complications, such as foot ulcers, infections, and even amputation. The blood work is relatively simple – just a few tubes of blood. And the nerve conduction study… yes, it involves some mild electrical stimulation, but it’s not painful. It helps us determine the extent of the nerve damage and guide our treatment plan. Look, I can order the blood work today, and we can schedule the nerve conduction study for next week. If you’re still uncomfortable after the blood work results come back, we can discuss other options. But please, let’s take this one step at a time. We'll get to the bottom of this together. And I will explain everything to you along the way, in plain English. Sound fair?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re a persistent one, aren’t you? Honestly, I don't know why I bother. Doctors always want to poke and prod. Alright, fine. Blood work. But no pokin’ and proddin’ until I say so. And you have to promise to explain everything to me. In plain English! No medical jargon, understand? And if it gets too much… if it gets too scary… I want to be able to stop. And I still think it’s a waste of good money. But… alright. Blood work. Let’s get it over with. But you owe me a nice cup of tea afterwards. A very nice cup of tea. And don't even think about mentioning those pokin' and proddin' tests again until I say so. Understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. I promise. No pokin’ and proddin’ until you say so. And a very nice cup of tea afterwards. Consider it a deal. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood right away. It should only take a few minutes. And then we’ll get you settled down with a comfortable chair and a magazine. You’re doing great. And remember, I’m here every step of the way. Now, let’s get this blood work done, and then we can talk about that tea. What’s your favorite kind?
PATIENT: Earl Grey, dear. Always Earl Grey. With a little bit of lemon. And not too much sugar. I used to make the best Earl Grey in the whole county, you know. Before… well, never mind. Just… hurry up, please. I don’t like waitin’ around. And please, be gentle with the needle. My veins aren't what they used to be. Honestly, it’s just one thing after another these days. But… alright. Let's get it over with. Bring on the Earl Grey, dear. Bring on the Earl Grey. .
