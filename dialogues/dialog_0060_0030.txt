DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest, but I've noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not like I don’t shower, you know? I always have. It’s just…different lately. I can’t really describe it, but it’s enough to make me feel self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss these things, Kerriann. Changes in body odor can be caused by a number of things, so we’ll figure it out. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe a month ago? Around the beginning of July, I'd say. It wasn't sudden, more like…gradual. At first I thought maybe it was just the heat, you know? But it’s still happening even on cooler days now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about a month ago, gradually worsening…and not entirely related to the temperature. Has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me see… Nothing major. My ex-husband has been… more insistent on getting things finalized with the divorce, if that counts as something. It’s been stressful, definitely. And I switched laundry detergents, now that I think about it. Just a new brand, nothing fancy. It smelled nice in the store, but… maybe that’s it? I don’t know. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stress can definitely contribute to changes in body odor, and sometimes detergents can be a factor. Let's explore that a little further. Besides the scent itself, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… No, not really. No rashes, no sweating more than usual, nothing like that. Just…the smell. It’s hard to explain. It’s not bad, exactly. Just…different. Like, not my usual scent. It feels…off. I’m probably making no sense.
DOCTOR: No, you're making perfect sense, Kerriann. It’s helpful to know it’s not accompanied by any rash or excessive sweating. "Off" is a good description. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I take lisinopril, I think it is. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s been fine. Other than that… I try to eat healthy, walk when I can, but you know, life gets in the way sometimes. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is relevant, thank you. And I see the lisinopril and the cholecystectomy. Good to know. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, usually. Sometimes I’ll take vitamin D in the winter, but I haven’t been taking it regularly lately. I don’t really like taking pills if I don’t have to, to be honest. I try to get what I need from food. And I drink a lot of water. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you drink a lot of water. It certainly matters. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my grandfather on my father’s side had heart problems. Nothing else that I can really think of, to be honest. My family wasn't really the type to talk about health stuff much. We mostly just… dealt with things as they came. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly helpful, Kerriann. Knowing about the diabetes and heart problems is good. Now, a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, and I don't use any tobacco products. I actually really dislike the smell of it. My first husband smoked for a while, and it was one of the reasons I left him, honestly. I try to stay away from it as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive. Just to relax, you know? I don’t drink hard liquor, and I definitely don’t drink every day. I’m not much of a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Lastly, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Yes, I am. But it’s…casual. Not a regular thing, if that makes sense. Just…when it happens. I didn’t think that was relevant, but… I figured I should be honest. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It's good you're open with me, Kerriann. It is relevant, as some changes in odor can be related to infections. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m a little worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. There’s no unusual discoloration. Do you notice any changes in your underarms?
PATIENT: No, nothing in my underarms. They look normal, as far as I can tell. I’ve glanced at them, obviously, but… no redness, no bumps, no itching. Just… my usual skin. I did notice my feet smell a little different lately, too. Not terrible, but… more noticeable than usual. Is that related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know about your feet. It could be related. Sometimes changes in body odor can be multifactorial. Given your history, and the lack of any significant findings on the physical exam, I’m suspecting a few possibilities. It could be hormonal changes, especially as you’re approaching menopause. Changes in diet or medication can also play a role. And sometimes it's simply the bacteria on your skin shifting. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I'd like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and a complete blood count. And I'm going to order a urine analysis as well. Just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I mean, I’d rather be safe than sorry, right? If it's just hormones, that's one thing, but I want to make sure it's not something more serious. So, blood work and a urine analysis… Okay. Where do I go to get those done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll send the orders to the lab here in the clinic. They’re just down the hall, and the receptionist can schedule you for a time that works best. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, continue with your usual hygiene routine. You can also try using an antibacterial soap when you shower, and make sure you’re thoroughly drying your skin after bathing. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 3-5 business days… Okay. Antibacterial soap and dry thoroughly… I can do that. It’s just… it’s nice to have a plan, you know? And to know we’re ruling things out. Thank you, Dr. Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I understand it can be unsettling when things change. We'll get to the bottom of it. The receptionist will be happy to schedule your lab work and your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
