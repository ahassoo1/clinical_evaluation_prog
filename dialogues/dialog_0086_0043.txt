DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's this headache I've been gettin'. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band. It’s been hangin’ around for a little while now, nothin’ too serious, but it just won’t go away, you know?
DOCTOR: A headache, alright. And you say it's been going on for a "little while"?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… let me think. It started, I reckon, maybe… three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda slips when you get to be my age! It wasn't bad at first, just a little somethin', but it’s gotten steadier, you know? Like a dull ache most of the time. Not sharp, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, okay. And you said it feels like a tight band around the back of your head. Has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, not really anythin’ specific I can pinpoint. Bright lights bother it a little, maybe. And if I’m really tired, it gets worse for sure. But I've been tryin' to get more rest. I used to work long hours, givin’ financial advice, but I'm mostly retired now. Still help folks out sometimes, though! It’s hard to say no when people need help.
DOCTOR: Financial advice… alright. And bright lights make it worse, and it's aggravated by fatigue. Any nausea or vision changes with these headaches, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No sickness, and my eyesight’s still pretty good for an old man, thankfully! I still read the paper every mornin’. No blurry vision or nothin’ like that. Just the headache, mostly. It's more… annoying than anything. Doesn’t stop me from doin' things, but it’s always there, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea or vision changes. Just a persistent headache. Have you tried anything to relieve it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you bet. I've taken some of those over-the-counter pain relievers… ibuprofen, mostly. Helps a little, for a bit, but it comes back. I’ve also tried puttin’ a cold compress on the back of my neck. My wife… my ex-wife, used to swear by that. Didn’t do much for me, really. She was good at takin’ care of things, that woman. But that’s a story for another day, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen, cold compress… and those provided only temporary relief. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… I’ve been feelin’ a little… off, I guess. Kinda tired all the time, even when I do get enough sleep. And my appetite ain’t been what it used to be. I used to love a good Hmong meal, but lately, nothin’ really sounds good. Just… not hungry, you know? Could just be gettin’ old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and decreased appetite… Okay. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No shiverin’ or feelin’ hot and cold. And I sleep pretty sound, don't wake up all sweaty or nothin’ like that. Mostly just… tired. Like a low battery, you know? Just runnin’ on fumes. I've been drinkin' plenty of water, though. My daughter always tells me to stay hydrated. She worries about me. Good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started about three weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, around three weeks, like I said. And it’s been pretty steady since then. Not gettin' worse, not gettin' much better. Just… hangin' around. I've been tryin' to think if somethin' happened around that time… nothin' comes to mind. Just went about my usual business, helpin' folks with their money, spendin' time with my grandkids… It's just a headache, Doctor. I don't want to take up too much of your time. Lots of other people need help, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Let's just do a quick neurological exam, just to rule things out. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just point, and I'll follow it. My eyes ain't what they used to be, but I can still see pretty well. Don't go too fast now! I'm an old man, remember.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger… good. Up and down… good. Now side to side… alright. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, movin’ ‘em up and down… side to side… alright. Squeezin’… how’s that? Pretty strong for an old man, huh? I used to shake a lot of hands dealin’ with finances. Gotta have a good grip, you know. People judge you by things like that.
DOCTOR: Good grip strength. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Well, that's a good question! Let me think… It’s… it’s August, right? So it must be… 2025. Yes, 2025. I keep up with things, you know. Gotta know what's goin' on with the market! Though sometimes the dates slip my mind, the numbers I remember just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat these three words after me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Go ahead. I used to have to remember a lot of complicated financial terms, so a few words shouldn’t be too hard. Just tell me what they are.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There you go. Easy enough. Though penny makes me think of interest rates, now you've got me thinkin' about money again! Old habits, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Just a little wobbly sometimes, these old bones ain't what they used to be. There you go. Not bad for an 84-year-old, huh? Though I prefer sittin' down, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Based on what you've told me, and the exam… it could be a tension headache, exacerbated by fatigue and stress, even retirement stress. However, given your decreased appetite and fatigue, and your age, I'm going to order some blood work. Just to rule out anything else. We'll check your thyroid, your vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. I also want you to schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist to check your vision, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, huh? Sounds… serious. But I understand, Doctor. Gotta be careful. Vitamin levels, thyroid… I’ll remember that. And the eye doctor, alright. You think it could be somethin’ with my eyes then? I haven’t had them checked in a while. Okay, I’ll do what you say. Just… let me know when the results come back, alright? I’m not too worried, but it’s good to know what’s goin’ on. I appreciate you takin’ the time, Doctor. Even if it is just an old man with a headache. .
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard procedure, Mr. Gibbel. We need to rule things out. I’ll have the lab requisition printed for you, and the receptionist will schedule the eye appointment. If you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, stiff neck, severe vision changes, or confusion – go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll review the results in about a week. I’ll have a nurse call you with a follow-up appointment time. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
