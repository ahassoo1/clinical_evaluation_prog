DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. I want to have a baby, and I want it to be…easy, you know? No problems. My husband…well, he was a good man, and things didn't work out then, so I just want this to be simple this time. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely reasonable to want a straightforward pregnancy. “Easy” isn’t something we can guarantee, unfortunately, but we can definitely do everything possible to optimize your chances of a healthy pregnancy and delivery. To start, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Ugh, history… Honestly? It was a while ago. And things weren’t…great. There was one, but it didn’t…go well. I don’t really like to talk about it. And before you ask, no, not because of me. It was…complications. Look, is there a test we can just do to see if I’m ready? I don’t need to rehash old things.
DOCTOR: I understand you're not comfortable discussing the previous pregnancy in detail, and that’s perfectly alright. However, knowing something about it is important to assess your risk factors and determine the best course of action. Even a brief summary can be helpful. But we can start with some general pre-conception testing. A basic blood panel can check for things like immunity to rubella and varicella, screen for anemia, and check your thyroid function. We'd also want to do a Pap smear if it's been a while. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, I have private insurance, so I assume all the good tests are covered, right? Pap smear, fine. Blood tests, whatever. Just…don't make me sit around all day. And I don't want a lecture about lifestyle changes. I take care of myself. I eat…generally healthy. I don’t smoke. Just do the tests and tell me what I need to know. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard. We’ll order the standard pre-conception panel, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, rubella and varicella titers, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We'll also schedule the Pap smear. Your insurance should cover these tests, but it’s always best to verify with them directly to be certain of your out-of-pocket costs. While we wait for the results, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low last year. And allergies? Nothing serious. I get a little sniffly sometimes with dust, but who doesn't? Honestly, I’m very healthy. I don’t understand why this would even be a problem. I eat my greens, I get some exercise… Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement, no serious allergies. That’s good to know. It’s excellent that you prioritize your health. We are just being thorough, Carmaleta. It's important to rule out anything that could potentially affect a pregnancy. The blood draw shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We can get it done right away in the lab next door. While you’re there, they’ll also collect a urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's just get it over with. The lab next door, you say? Just…make sure they’re quick. I really don’t have all day to sit around waiting for needles and cups. Honestly, this is a lot of fuss for something that should be natural. Alright, let’s go.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, escort you to the lab. She’ll get you checked in. She’s very efficient. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Maria should be with you momentarily.
PATIENT: Good. Finally. Tell Maria to hurry. I’ve got a life, you know.
