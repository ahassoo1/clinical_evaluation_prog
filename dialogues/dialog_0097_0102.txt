DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Georgiou, you said? A nice name. Well… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve just been… sighing a lot lately. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… heavy. It happens all day, really. I don’t even always mean to do it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Vantine. It’s good you’re bringing it up. “Heavy” sighs… I understand. It's helpful to describe things as you experience them. All day, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, all day. Or most of the day, anyway. It's… been going on for a while now. Weeks, maybe? Months? Time… it all sort of blurs together these days. My wife… she used to keep track of things. But… she’s gone now. It just feels like a weight, sometimes. A big… empty weight. I don't know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Vantine. Losing your wife… that's a tremendous weight, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling this way. It's okay to not have a clear timeline, especially with everything you've been through. So, aside from the sighing, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. Not really… I eat about the same, I guess. Maybe a little less hungry sometimes. And I sleep alright… mostly. Though I wake up a few times a night. Just… old age, probably. And my son… he worries about me. He keeps telling me I should be taking better care of myself. I don’t really feel sick, you know? Just… tired. And… sad, I suppose. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little less hungry, waking up during the night, and feeling tired and sad. That's helpful, thank you. It sounds like you're feeling a bit of grief, which is completely normal after such a significant loss. But we should also rule out any medical reasons for the changes you've described. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or a cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little ache sometimes, but just like old age, you know? Shortness of breath… maybe when I walk up the hill to the market, but I always have trouble with that hill. And no cough. I used to smoke a long time ago, but I quit… oh, goodness, decades ago. My wife didn’t like it. She was a good woman. Always looking out for me. Sorry. It just… comes out sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Vantine. There’s no need to apologize. It's good you quit smoking so long ago. And it sounds like that ache in your chest is likely related to exertion, but we will want to check it. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. That’s a good question. No, not really. Not anymore. The doctor took me off most things after my wife got sick. Something about… interactions? I can’t quite remember. I used to take something for my blood pressure, I think. But it’s been years. I take a little calcium sometimes, for my bones. My son buys it for me. Other than that… no. Nothing regular. I mostly just drink tea. Green tea. It's good for you, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, green tea is good! And thank you for letting me know about the calcium. Good, that helps me get a clearer picture. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring, but everyone does, right? Pollen, I guess. Never been really sick from food. I like to cook, you see, so I’m careful about what I eat. Mostly Khmer food. Spicy! My wife liked it mild, but I always added a little extra chili. She’d complain, but she’d still eat it.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely. It sounds like you enjoy cooking very much. No known allergies, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… goodness, I don’t even remember. Go ahead, please. I’ll try to be still. Though my bones do creak a bit these days!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Just breathe normally. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given you haven’t had a check-up in a while. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases, which is common with age. Ears are clear. Throat is slightly dry, no obvious signs of infection. Pulse is regular at 78. No swelling in the extremities. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, Mr. Vantine, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished lung sounds warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh. Investigation… That sounds serious. What does that mean, Doctor? Are my lungs… bad? I do get a little winded sometimes, like I said. And my blood pressure… is that the sighing? Is that why I’m doing that so much? I just feel… tired all the time. And sad.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Vantine. "Investigation" simply means we’re going to do a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The sighing could be related to your blood pressure, or it could be a sign of anxiety or simply a habit. And the fatigue and sadness… those could be a lot of things, including grief, as we discussed. To start, I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia and other potential issues. I also want to order a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And finally, I’d like to get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. So many tests. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then alright. Yes, please. Do what you need to do. I just want to feel… better. I just want to not be so tired all the time. And… and maybe stop sighing so much. It’s embarrassing, you know? My son gets worried when I do that. He says it sounds like… like I’m giving up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vantine. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. And it's very good that your son is looking out for you. We'll take things one step at a time. Alright, I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. She'll also schedule you for a chest X-ray at the imaging center down the street. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you start taking a low-dose aspirin daily, unless you have any allergies or medical conditions that would prevent that. It can help with your blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aspirin… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything… my wife always made sure of that. And… low dose, you said? That sounds alright. Yes, let’s try that. And… thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It’s nice to finally… talk to someone about this. My son worries, but he has his own life, you know? And I don't want to burden him. So… thank you. Now, what do I do about the blood tests? Do I need to fast? Is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It’s my pleasure. And you’re right to take care of your son, too. He sounds like a good man. For the blood tests, yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The nurse will give you a specific instruction sheet before you leave. She’ll also explain where to go for the X-ray. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… rest and drink water. And aspirin. It’s a lot to remember, but I’ll do my best. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I suppose I’ll go home and… try to relax. Though I don’t know how well that will go.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And don’t worry about remembering everything. We’ll follow up with you as soon as we have the results. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad you came in. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. The nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and draw your blood. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine. And remember, it’s okay to not be okay sometimes. It's important to be kind to yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that means a lot. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. I will try to be kind to myself. And I will try to rest. Goodbye, Doctor Georgiou. And thank you again.
