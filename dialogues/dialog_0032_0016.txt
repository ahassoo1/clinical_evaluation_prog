DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. Though I must say, you’re rather young to be a doctor, aren’t you? Anyway, it's about the bruising. I've been getting…more of it. Seems like any little bump turns into a purple mess. And I'm on that blood thinner, you see. The one they put you on when…well, never mind. It’s just concerning, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, age doesn’t necessarily dictate competence, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I am fully capable. Regarding the bruising…you mentioned a blood thinner. Could you remind me which one you are taking, and for what condition it was prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get me wrong, I’m sure you study hard. It’s just…experience, you know? As for the medicine…let me think. It's…warfarin, I believe. Yes, that’s it. Warfarin. They gave it to me after…my wife passed. Something about clots. I don't recall all the details, honestly. It was a difficult time. And frankly, the doctors then weren't exactly forthcoming with explanations. Just told me to take the pills.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, alright. And it was prescribed following a clot – do you recall where the clot was located, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. It was…in my leg, I think? Or maybe my lung? They did a lot of tests. Honestly, it's all a blur. It was a very upsetting time. I just want to know why I’m bruising like an old peach now. It's…undignified. And my daughter keeps looking at me with that worried expression.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. I understand this is difficult to recall. Let me see what the records say… It appears you were diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, in your left leg, approximately two years ago, and were started on warfarin at that time. Now, besides the increased bruising, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Deep vein…what now? Look, Doctor, I’m a pathologist, not a medical historian. I look at cells under a microscope all day, I don't memorize Latin-sounding diagnoses. And no, besides the bruising, I don’t feel any different. A little tired, maybe. But who isn't these days? It's just…more bruising. And it's worrying my daughter. That’s what brought me in, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. And I assure you, I’m not trying to quiz you on medical terminology. However, understanding the reason for the medication is important when assessing side effects. Now, regarding the bruising, where specifically are you noticing it?
PATIENT: Well, aren’t you full of questions. Fine. It's mostly on my arms, I suppose. And my legs. Pretty much anywhere I knock into something. Even a gentle bump now leaves a mark. It wasn’t like this before. I used to be able to…well, never mind. It's just…more noticeable now. And frankly, it’s starting to hurt a little. Not terribly, but enough to be annoying. And it looks…awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bruising on the arms and legs, increasingly frequent and somewhat painful. Now, let’s do a quick physical examination to assess the extent of the bruising and check for any other concerning signs. If you’ll please roll up your sleeves and loosen your trousers a bit. We'll start with your arms, then move to your legs.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m back in medical school. And I was the teacher, you know. Very well. But if you find anything truly alarming, do let me know. I haven’t got all day. And please be gentle. My skin is…delicate.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. As expected, there’s evidence of ecchymosis – that’s the medical term for bruising – in multiple areas on both arms. The bruises appear to be in varying stages of healing, suggesting both recent and older injuries. I’m not feeling any significant swelling or warmth, which is good. Now, let’s take a look at your legs. Please turn onto your stomach if you're able. I’ll need to examine both legs.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Ecchymosis? Must you use such…fancy words? I assure you, they're just bruises. And I haven't fallen or anything. It's not like I'm walking into walls. Just…more bruising. Do be careful. My back isn't what it used to be. And try not to take too long. I have a rather important appointment later.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Similar findings on the legs – multiple areas of ecchymosis, varying stages of healing. I am not feeling any significant swelling or warmth, nor any palpable masses. However, I do notice some slight tenderness upon palpation in the calf region of your left leg. It's minimal, but it warrants further attention. Now, let’s discuss your current warfarin dosage and recent lab results. Do you happen to know when your last INR was checked?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're making me feel like a science project. I wouldn’t know an INR if it bit me. I just take the pills the pharmacy gives me. They tell me what to do, and I do it. I assume they’re keeping track of all these…numbers. They're the professionals, aren’t they? It's all very confusing. Perhaps you should just call them and ask. That’s what I do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. However, it’s important for me to have a complete understanding of your medication regimen and lab results to ensure your safety. I will review your records to determine your last INR value. In the meantime, can you tell me if you've experienced any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool – or any other symptoms that might be related to your warfarin therapy?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to interrogate me? No, I haven't been bleeding from every orifice, if that’s what you're asking. A little nosebleed now and then, perhaps. But I live in a dry climate! And sometimes my gums bleed a little when I brush. But that happens to everyone, doesn’t it? Really, I just want to know why I’m bruising like a peach. Is that too much to ask? And can we please get on with this? My daughter is waiting to take me to lunch. She’s worried about me, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. According to your records, your last INR was checked approximately one month ago and was within the therapeutic range – 2.3. However, given your report of increased bruising, even with a therapeutic INR, and the slight tenderness in your left calf, I would like to order some additional blood work to rule out any underlying causes for the bruising. We’ll check a complete blood count, a coagulation panel, and a basic metabolic panel. Additionally, I’d like to order a D-dimer to assess for any evidence of a recent blood clot. It's a precautionary measure, but it’s important to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, more blood work? You're going to drain me dry! Very well. If it will get me out of here and reassure my daughter, then yes. Fine. Do what you must. But please, no more poking and prodding. And can we at least talk about why this is happening? I don't want to just be a collection of numbers and lab results. Is it possible…could it be something serious? I’d like to know, even if it’s not what I want to hear. My wife…well, I just want to make sure it’s nothing like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. And you are absolutely right – you deserve a thorough explanation. While your INR is currently within the therapeutic range, increased bruising can have several causes, even with a stable INR. It could be related to minor trauma that you don't recall, age-related changes in your skin, certain medications, or, less commonly, an underlying medical condition. The blood work will help us rule out any serious causes and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do experience any significant trauma, please seek immediate medical attention. I also suggest talking to your daughter about your concerns – it's important to have a strong support system during times like these. Now, I’ll write the orders for the blood work, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…acceptable. Thank you. At least you’re explaining things now. And yes, I will talk to my daughter. She worries too much. And if you find anything…anything at all…please be frank with me. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not afraid of the truth. Just…please don’t keep me in the dark. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I need to lie down. All this poking and prodding has quite exhausted me. And thank you…for listening.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand. I will ensure you are kept fully informed of the results. The lab orders have been sent, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the findings. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – such as severe pain, swelling, or uncontrolled bleeding – please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Get some rest, Mr. Farson.
