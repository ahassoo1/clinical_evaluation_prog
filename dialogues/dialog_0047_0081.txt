DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Chakka. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Jailia, actually. And frankly, I’m not entirely pleased with the level of service already. A rural clinic… it wasn’t my first choice, naturally. But my husband insisted. I’ve been… diminishing, I suppose. Losing weight despite a perfectly adequate diet, and I’m perpetually exhausted. And the night sweats are simply dreadful. It’s quite disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. Diminishing… and night sweats. Adequate diet, you say?
PATIENT: Adequate is… a rather understated term, Doctor. It’s not as though I’m indulging in unhealthy habits. Primarily lean proteins, plenty of vegetables, a reasonable amount of fruit. My husband handles the grocery shopping, he’s very particular about these things. I assure you, it’s not a dietary issue. It’s… something else. Something that requires a proper diagnosis, and hopefully, a swift resolution. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s not dwell on the diet then. You mentioned exhaustion. Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify? Honestly, Doctor, must everything be reduced to numbers? It’s… pervasive. I wake up feeling as though I’ve run a marathon. Simple tasks, like… arranging flowers, leave me utterly depleted. And it’s not improving. It’s steadily worsening, despite adequate rest. I find myself needing… longer and longer naps throughout the day. It’s affecting my ability to maintain my schedule, and frankly, it’s… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. It began gradually, a mild fatigue, easily dismissed. But it’s escalated steadily since then. The night sweats started about a month ago, coinciding with a particularly stressful commission from a… less-than-discerning client. Though, I highly doubt that’s the root cause. I find it difficult to believe a mere client could induce such… physical distress.
DOCTOR: A commission?
PATIENT: Yes, a graphic design commission, Doctor. I am a graphic designer, as I mentioned previously. A rather lucrative, yet… demanding project. It involved a significant amount of detail work, and unfortunately, the client was… exceedingly particular about revisions. Though, again, I maintain that this is unlikely to be the sole contributing factor. I simply find it improbable that professional stress could manifest in such… alarming physical symptoms. It suggests something far more… substantial.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. My appetite is… diminished, naturally, given the weight loss. And I’ve noticed a slight… discomfort, a dull ache, in my lower back. It’s intermittent, not constant, and easily dismissed, but it is present. And… I’ve been feeling rather irritable, Doctor. Unusually so. My husband has commented on it. Which, frankly, is quite concerning. I pride myself on my composure. To be so easily… agitated is simply out of character. Though I suspect that’s a consequence of the exhaustion. It’s difficult to maintain a pleasant disposition when one feels perpetually depleted.
DOCTOR: Right. Diminished appetite, lower back discomfort, irritability… Have you noticed any fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes?
PATIENT: Fever? No, Doctor. I assure you, my temperature is perfectly normal. Chills, no. And swollen… lymph nodes? I haven’t conducted a self-examination, Doctor. I hardly think that’s within my purview. I leave such matters to professionals. Though, I do recall feeling a slight… tenderness under my jawline a few weeks ago. It was fleeting, easily dismissed, but now that you mention it… Perhaps that’s relevant? Though, I suspect it’s simply a result of… tension. I do clench my jaw when I’m stressed. It’s a rather unattractive habit, I admit. But hardly indicative of a serious ailment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My past medical history is… unremarkable, Doctor. I have always been in excellent health. Routine check-ups, of course, and the occasional bout of the common cold, but nothing of any significance. I received all of my childhood vaccinations, as required. My husband is quite diligent about these things. He’s rather meticulous. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. I lead a… disciplined lifestyle, Doctor. I assure you, I am not prone to ailments. This… current situation is most perplexing. It deviates so drastically from my usual state of well-being.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… significant illness?
PATIENT: Hmm. My maternal grandmother… she suffered from a rather protracted illness in her later years. Something involving her… blood. I believe it was leukemia, though my mother was never particularly forthcoming with details. It was a rather… unpleasant topic. My father’s side of the family… generally robust, as far as I am aware. No history of cancer, heart disease, or any other… debilitating ailments. Though, my uncle Reginald did have a rather unfortunate incident involving a… tropical parasite during a business trip to the Amazon. But that’s hardly relevant, is it? A rather isolated incident, hardly indicative of a genetic predisposition to illness. Honestly, Doctor, I find it difficult to believe this is… hereditary. It simply doesn’t align with my family’s overall health profile.
DOCTOR: And what about your social history?
PATIENT: My social history? Doctor, I assure you, it's quite… contained. I am married, as I previously mentioned. My husband and I maintain a… quiet domestic life. We rarely socialize. It’s simply… preferable. I find large gatherings to be rather… draining. And frankly, the conversation is often quite… banal. I prefer the tranquility of my home, the order and precision of my work. I do not smoke, I rarely consume alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner on occasion – and I do not engage in any… illicit activities. A rather… disciplined lifestyle, as you may have gathered. I find excessive indulgence to be… uncouth. Honestly, Doctor, I struggle to see how my social habits could be contributing to this… perplexing ailment.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. I have never been allergic to anything. Not flowers, not animals, not food. I can consume shellfish without incident, I am not sensitive to pollen, and I am perfectly comfortable handling… even the most exotic of plants. My husband occasionally attempts to introduce new spices into our diet – purely for culinary experimentation, of course – and I have never experienced an adverse reaction. A perfectly robust constitution, Doctor. Honestly, I find it rather… improbable that an allergy could be the source of this… concerning affliction. It simply doesn’t align with my overall health profile.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: An examination table? Doctor, I assure you, my clothes are… rather delicate. And frankly, the thought of reclining on a… public surface is… unsettling. But very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. Though, I trust it's been… thoroughly sanitized? And please, be gentle. I bruise rather easily.
DOCTOR: Throat looks clear. No obvious inflammation. Hmm. A few slightly enlarged lymph nodes, but not significantly concerning. Lungs are clear, breathing is normal. Heart rate is normal, no murmurs. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Slightly underweight, but no masses. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems… within normal limits, physically. Which is… puzzling.
PATIENT: Puzzling? Doctor, you find my declining health "puzzling"? I assure you, this is hardly a trivial matter. I am experiencing genuine distress. The exhaustion, the night sweats, the irritability… these are not figments of my imagination. To dismiss my concerns as… physically unremarkable is frankly… unacceptable. Are you suggesting I am… fabricating these symptoms? Because that is deeply insulting. I expect a more thorough investigation, Doctor. And a more… empathetic approach.
DOCTOR: Look, Miss Chakka, I'm not dismissing your concerns. But a physical exam isn't always conclusive. We may need to run some bloodwork to get a better idea of what's going on. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and maybe a thyroid test. It could be a number of things – a vitamin deficiency, a minor infection, even stress, despite your… assertions to the contrary. I’ll order those tests now. The lab is down the hall. They'll take a sample, and we’ll have the results in a few days.
PATIENT: "A few days"? Doctor, I have commitments. Lucrative commissions awaiting completion. I cannot simply… idle for an indefinite period while you conduct… rudimentary tests. And stress, you say? As if I haven’t already addressed that. I maintain a remarkably composed lifestyle. It’s hardly plausible. Very well. Bloodwork, then. But I expect a swift turnaround. And a detailed explanation of the results. I’m not interested in vague generalizations or… speculative diagnoses. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a schedule to maintain. Direct me to this… laboratory. And please, ensure it’s… impeccably clean. I have standards, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. The nurse will take care of you. And Miss Chakka?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor? Do enlighten me.
DOCTOR: Try to get some rest while you wait for the results. And… perhaps consider whether there’s anything in your life – anything – that’s causing you undue stress. Even if you don’t think it is. It’s often the things we dismiss that are the most impactful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: "Consider"? Doctor, I assure you, my life is meticulously ordered. There is no… "undue stress". It's a rather… presumptuous suggestion. But very well. I will… indulge your curiosity. Though I highly doubt it will yield any meaningful results. And I expect a prompt notification when the results are available. Do not leave me waiting unnecessarily.
