DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my leg. It's been swelling up, and it started after all the… the treatment for the cancer. It's just… bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your leg after cancer treatment. That’s good information to start with. When you say “treatment”, could you tell me a little more about what kind of treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was… chemo, I think? And then… some radiation. It was a while ago now. A couple of years, maybe? I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It was… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, it was a lot, and it’s completely normal to not remember all the specifics. A couple of years ago, chemo and radiation… okay. And when did you first notice the swelling in your leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It didn’t happen right after everything. Maybe… six months ago? It started small, just my ankle feeling a bit puffy at the end of the day. Now it’s… well, you can see. It’s gotten bigger.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see some swelling. Is it in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. My right leg is fine, thank you. It's mostly in the calf, but my foot swells up too sometimes. It's… uncomfortable, especially when it's warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, mainly in the calf, but the foot too. And it gets worse with warmth. Does it feel painful?
PATIENT: Not really painful, exactly. More… heavy? Like it's really full. And sometimes it feels… tight? Like my skin is stretched too much. Not a sharp pain, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy and tight, not sharp pain. Do you notice any redness or warmth to the leg when it’s swollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me feel. No, not really red. It doesn't feel warmer than the other leg, no. Just… bigger. And a bit… achy, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or warmth, just bigger and sometimes achy. Have you noticed any changes in the skin – like thickening, discoloration, or sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. The skin looks… normal, I think? Maybe a little… dry, but I always have dry skin. It hasn’t changed color, though. No, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no skin changes. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Just… the usual old lady things? A bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. And my knees… they bother me sometimes, but that’s just from getting old, I guess. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and some knee pain. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a little pill for the blood pressure. Every morning. I forget what it’s called… something with an ‘A’ in it, I think. And sometimes I take something for the knees when they’re really bad, but not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication with an 'A' for blood pressure, and something as needed for your knees. Do you know the dosages of either of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't. My daughter handles all that. She brings me the pills every month and tells me what to take. I’m not good with remembering numbers, you see. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can look those up in the system. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Never. I think I would remember that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam of your leg, if that’s alright with you. I just want to check a few things.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to feel around. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No… not really. A little bit here, but not much. It’s just… uncomfortable when you press. Not painful, just… not nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, some discomfort with palpation, but not sharp pain. I’m going to measure the circumference of both of your calves, just to get a baseline. Okay, your right calf measures 38 centimeters, and your left calf… is 42 centimeters. That’s a 4 centimeter difference. It’s good we got that documented. I’m also going to check your pulses in your feet. Your pulses feel strong and equal on both sides. That’s good. Now, just a quick look at your skin. I don’t see any open sores or discoloration. Alright. This swelling, combined with the history of cancer treatment, makes me suspect we’re dealing with lymphedema. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Lympe… what did you call it? Lymphe-de-ma? No, I don’t think so. The cancer doctor never said anything about that. They just said… I was all clear. Does that mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Lymphedema. It's a build-up of fluid in the tissues, often after cancer treatment, especially if lymph nodes were removed or damaged. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong now, but it does explain the swelling. It’s common after treatment, and it’s manageable. The fact that your pulses are good is reassuring. To be sure, and to rule out other causes like a blood clot, I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg. It’s a non-invasive test that will show us the blood flow in your veins. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… Doppler? Is that like… an X-ray? I don't really like those. And a blood clot… oh dear. Is that serious? I just want to get rid of the swelling, that's all. It’s just so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: No, a Doppler ultrasound doesn't use X-rays. It uses sound waves to create a picture of the blood vessels in your leg. It's completely painless. And yes, a blood clot can be serious, which is why we want to rule it out. But it's not necessarily what we're dealing with here. The swelling, with your history, is more likely lymphedema. The ultrasound will just give us a clearer picture and confirm that. Would you be comfortable with me ordering that for you?
PATIENT: Oh… no X-rays, good. And you think it's probably this… lympe-de-ma thing? If it’s not serious, then yes, go ahead and order the test. I just want to know what's going on, and get it fixed. It's just… tiring, always having to come to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get the order sent to the radiology department. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. It's usually pretty quick. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you elevate your leg as much as possible when you're resting, and I'd like you to start wearing a compression stocking on that leg. It’ll help to reduce the swelling. I'll write you a prescription for one. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Compression… what did you call it? A stocking? Like… like the ones old ladies wear? Oh dear. And elevating… I suppose I can put my feet up. Will that really help? And the radiology… how long will that take? I have a hair appointment on Friday.
DOCTOR: Yes, a compression stocking, like the ones sometimes older ladies wear. But we'll get one fitted properly for you so it's comfortable. It’s a bit more supportive than the regular ones. And yes, elevating your leg will help. It helps the fluid drain back towards your heart. Even just 20-30 minutes a few times a day can make a difference. The radiology department usually has appointments within a few days. I'll put a note on the order to try and get you in before your hair appointment on Friday. They’ll call you to schedule, and you can let them know your availability. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any other medication besides what we mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… getting old! My daughter usually tells me everything I need to know, she's very organised. Oh, wait... I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that's it. Nothing else. Really. I just want this swelling to go away. It's so annoying!
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D in the winter, that's good to know. It’s good that you’re taking care of yourself. Alright, so to recap, we’ve ordered a Doppler ultrasound to rule out a blood clot, and I’m recommending leg elevation and a compression stocking. I'll write you a prescription for the stocking. Once we have the ultrasound results, we can discuss further treatment options for the lymphedema, which might include physical therapy. I'm also going to give you a handout with information about lymphedema, just so you have something to read over. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, a handout, that’s good. Yes, I always like to have something to read. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I hope this ultrasound doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help. Hopefully the ultrasound will be quick and give us some answers. If you have any concerns or questions before your appointment, or after you receive the results, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's that handout, and I’ll get the prescriptions sent to your pharmacy. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
