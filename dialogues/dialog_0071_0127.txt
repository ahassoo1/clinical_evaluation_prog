DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Gedalya. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve noticed I’ve been getting weaker, especially in my arms and legs. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s not terribly noticeable all the time, but I can feel it, and I’ve had a couple of people mention it.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Weakness in the arms and legs, and drooping eyelids. That is something we should look into. Just pulling up your chart now… 25 years old, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Twenty-five. It just… started gradually, maybe a month or two ago. At first, I thought I was just tired, you know? Work has been a bit demanding lately. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels… different than just being tired.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. A month or two… and it’s not improving with rest. Okay. Before we get into specifics, can you describe the weakness a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. But things feel heavier, if that makes sense? Like, lifting something that used to be easy now requires a bit more effort. And I get tired faster. When I’m using my arms for a longer period, like… working on something, they start to ache. It's similar with my legs after a longer walk. It's not pain, necessarily, but a kind of… heavy fatigue.
DOCTOR: Okay, "heavy fatigue," that's helpful. And is this weakness consistent throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It seems to be worse later in the day, definitely. In the mornings I feel… almost normal. But as the day goes on, it gets progressively worse. It's like there's less energy as the hours tick by. And the eyelid drooping… that seems more noticeable at the end of the day too, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, progressive weakness throughout the day, worse in the evening. And the eyelids are more affected later as well. Do you notice any difficulty with things like climbing stairs, or lifting things above your head?
PATIENT: Climbing stairs… yes, a little. Not terribly, but I definitely feel it more than I used to. And lifting things above my head… I haven’t really tried anything particularly heavy, to be honest. I’ve been avoiding it, I suppose, because I know it would be more effort. It just… feels like I wouldn’t be able to do it as easily. It's a bit of a mental thing too, I think. I’m worried I’ll drop something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision, like double vision or blurred vision, at any point?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I wear glasses, for nearsightedness, so things are always a little… not perfectly sharp. But I don’t think anything has changed with my vision itself. No blurriness or double vision, no. Just… the normal glasses-wearing experience. I haven’t needed to get a new prescription recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. And just to cover all the bases, have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing, or any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Swallowing is fine, and my speech feels completely normal. No slurring, no trouble getting words out. My… ex-wife might disagree about the content of my speech sometimes, but that’s a separate issue entirely.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to stay healthy, mostly. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I eat peanuts, I have shellfish… nothing bothers me, as far as I know. I did have a bit of a rash a few years ago after using a new laundry detergent, but that wasn’t a serious allergy, just… irritating skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications, no known allergies. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, just to get a more complete picture. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No hospitalizations, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a child – playing football, being foolish – but that was just a simple fracture. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I’ve had the usual childhood diseases – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious in adulthood. I try to avoid doctors when possible, if that answers your question.
DOCTOR: I understand that sentiment. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother is still alive, she's healthy. She's 72. My father passed away a few years ago, he had… heart problems. And I have a sister, she lives in Stockholm. She seems perfectly healthy too, as far as I know. No family history of… muscle problems or anything like that. It’s a fairly unremarkable medical history on both sides, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking, no. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I’m not much of a party person, if that gives you any indication.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, tell me about your work. What do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a Facilities Manager. It’s… a lot of walking around, checking things, making sure everything is in order. Buildings, mostly. I’m responsible for maintenance, repairs, that sort of thing. It can be stressful, occasionally, dealing with contractors and budgets. But it's mostly physical, you know? On my feet all day, lifting things, climbing ladders… though I've been avoiding the ladders lately. It’s a fairly demanding job, physically. That's why I thought maybe it was just fatigue at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, a demanding physical job. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and a few other things. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'd like to figure out what’s going on, and if that's what it takes, then let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, first, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll examine your eyes. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's check your reflexes… Reflexes are… a little diminished in your arms, and slightly weaker in your legs. Now, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Grip strength is… noticeably weaker in your right hand compared to your left. Now, can you please push against my hands with your arms, as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… harder than it should, I think. I’m trying, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it usually does. Especially on the right side. It feels… sluggish, almost. And… yes, it definitely feels weaker than my left. I'm not imagining it, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you're not imagining it. Your strength is diminished, particularly on your right side. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements. Hmm. Your eye movements are… a little bit slow, and there's a slight… drooping of your right eyelid. And can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… but it takes a bit more concentration than it usually does. And… yes, I can feel my eyelid getting heavier, especially when I look to the right. It feels like I’m straining a bit to keep it open. It's definitely more noticeable now that you're pointing it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. That's all for the quick physical exam. Based on your symptoms – the progressive weakness, the drooping eyelid, and the findings on the physical exam – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. Specifically, I'm thinking about Myasthenia Gravis, or a similar condition affecting the nerves and muscles. However, this is just a preliminary assessment. To confirm this, we’ll need to run some tests. I'm going to order a blood test to check for certain antibodies, and I would also like to schedule a nerve conduction study and electromyography, or EMG, to evaluate the function of your muscles and nerves.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what was it? Is that… serious? And those tests… are they painful? I'm not a fan of needles, to be honest. I just… I thought it was just overwork. I didn't realize it could be something… like that.
DOCTOR: Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It can be serious, but it's treatable, and many people live full and active lives with the condition. The severity varies greatly. As for the tests, the blood test is fairly routine. As for the nerve conduction study and EMG, it involves small needles and electrical stimulation. There may be some mild discomfort, like a brief muscle twitch, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to get those tests scheduled as soon as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If you think it's necessary… then yes, let's schedule the tests. As soon as possible sounds good. I'd rather know what's going on, even if it's not good news. The needles… I'll try not to faint. Can you explain the next steps? Where do I go for the tests, and how long will it take to get the results? And... is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood test with the local lab – they’re just down the hall. For the nerve conduction study and EMG, we’ll need to refer you to a neurologist. I'll send the referral electronically, and they will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. Typically, it takes about a week or two to get the results back. In the meantime, I wouldn’t recommend any strenuous activity. Avoid overexertion, and try to get plenty of rest. If you notice any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. We’ll review the test results together once they’re available, and discuss the best course of action. I'm also going to write you a temporary work note excusing you from physically demanding tasks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… very good, thank you. The work note is a huge relief, actually. I was worried about trying to explain this to my boss. And I understand about avoiding exertion. I’ll be careful. Difficulty breathing… that's a bit worrying to hear. I haven’t experienced that yet, but I'll keep a close eye on things. So, just… wait for the neurologist to call, and then schedule the tests. And avoid overdoing it. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: No, I think that sums it up for now. We've covered the most important points. I'll also have my assistant provide you with some informational brochures about Myasthenia Gravis, just to give you a better understanding of the condition. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, even if it's just to talk. It’s okay to be worried – this is a lot to take in. We’ll work through this together. My assistant, Sarah, will be with you shortly to schedule the appointments and give you the brochures. Do you have any immediate questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’m still a little scared, but… at least I know what we're looking at now. I'll wait for Sarah.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. And remember, we'll be here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out. I'll have Sarah come in now.
PATIENT: .
