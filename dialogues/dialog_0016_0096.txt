DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit hard to explain… things just seem really bright lately. Like, really bright. It's been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it's making everyday stuff kinda difficult. I think it’s something to do with the sun, maybe? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, “really bright” – let’s unpack that a bit. When you say bright, is it an intensity of light, or do you mean colors seem more vivid?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's definitely the intensity, I think. Colors don't seem different, just… everything is almost too much. Like when I step outside, even with sunglasses, it feels like I’m staring into a lightbulb. It doesn’t really hurt, not exactly, but it’s very uncomfortable and makes my eyes feel strained. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sensitivity to light, even with sunglasses, and it’s been going on for a few weeks. Does this happen indoors too, or is it primarily when you’re outside?
PATIENT: It's worse outside, definitely. But it’s been happening indoors too, now. Not as bad, but like… fluorescent lights in the grocery store? Those really bother me. Even just the TV sometimes feels too bright. I’ve started keeping the curtains closed a lot more, which isn’t great, I know. It's just easier, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. Work's been the same, I'm still a dental assistant. No new medications… Oh! Well, my wife… she passed away about six months ago. Everything's been a bit… different since then, you know? I don’t know if that could be related, but it’s the biggest change in my life recently.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Arbin. That is a significant change, and it absolutely can impact things, both physically and emotionally. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Let me quickly pull up your EHR information… Okay, I see your basic medical history here. No prior eye issues noted. No history of migraines. Are you experiencing any headaches with this light sensitivity?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no headaches. Just… the brightness. It’s just really annoying, and I'm worried something serious is going on. I've been trying to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but it hasn’t. I don’t usually bother doctors with things, but this is starting to really affect my day-to-day life.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let's do a quick eye exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll check your visual acuity, pupils, and do a basic assessment of your eyes. It will be a fairly standard exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Maskal. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, let’s start with your visual acuity. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Okay, let’s see… um… is that… 20/30? No, 20/25? It’s a little blurry, honestly. Is that the right one? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, 20/25 is a little reduced, but not drastically. Now let’s do the other eye. And this eye is also about 20/25. Okay. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your pupils and check your reaction. Just look straight ahead. Your pupils are equal in size and react to light, but they seem a bit… constricted. I'm also noting some slight redness in both eyes. Nothing dramatic, but worth documenting.
PATIENT: Okay. Constricted, you say? And redness? I hadn’t noticed the redness. Is that something serious? I really don’t like the sound of “constricted.” It just… sounds bad. I'm getting a little worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me how you feel. “Constricted” can sound concerning, and I want to be upfront with you. It’s not necessarily a sign of something terrible, but it does warrant further investigation. The redness is mild, and could be from a number of things - allergies, dry eyes, even just rubbing your eyes. Given your symptoms of increased light sensitivity, constricted pupils, and mild redness, combined with the recent loss of your wife, I’d like to consider a few possibilities. One possibility is iritis - inflammation inside the eye. Another is a neurological issue, although that is less likely given your other symptoms. And, we can’t rule out a stress-related component. To be thorough, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying systemic issues. I also recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more detailed eye exam. They can perform a tonometry test to check the pressure inside your eyes and assess the structures within your eye. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot to take in. Iritis… neurological issues… blood work… it all sounds pretty scary, to be honest. But I understand you’re just being thorough, and I appreciate that. I guess… yes, that’s alright. Blood work and seeing a specialist sounds like the right thing to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and get this sorted out. Will the specialist be able to tell me more about what’s causing the light sensitivity? And… how quickly can I see them?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll take it one step at a time. The ophthalmologist will be able to do a much more in-depth examination of your eyes, and hopefully pinpoint the exact cause of the light sensitivity. They can also rule out any other potential eye issues. I'm sending a referral to Dr. Elara Hassan, she’s a fantastic ophthalmologist and has a good reputation. Her office is about a 15-minute drive from here. I'll have my nurse print out the referral information for you, including her contact information and appointment scheduling details. As for the blood work, I’ll also give you a lab requisition form. You can go to any local lab, and they’ll draw the samples. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and the ophthalmologist’s findings once you have them. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Dr. Hassan, okay. And I'll get the lab work done. A follow-up appointment sounds perfect. Thank you, Dr. Maskal, for taking the time to listen and for not dismissing my concerns. It’s really helped to calm me down, even if I’m still a little worried. I appreciate your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It's my job to listen and help you figure things out. It’s completely understandable to be worried, and we’ll work through this together. Here's the referral information for Dr. Hassan, and the lab requisition form. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to give you some discharge instructions, including information on what to expect during the ophthalmology appointment and what symptoms to watch out for. In the meantime, if your light sensitivity worsens dramatically, or if you experience any vision changes or eye pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I really appreciate your help, Dr. Maskal. And thank you for letting me know about the emergency room, just in case. I guess… I’ll just try to stay calm and get these tests done. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Maria will be with you shortly. I wish you all the best. .
