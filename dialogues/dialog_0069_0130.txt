DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. Lots of sickness on my mother’s side, you see. Heart trouble mostly, and… other things. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I’m getting older, and… well, you understand. I want some peace of mind, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Schwer. It’s very proactive of you to want to stay on top of things, especially with a family history of heart trouble. We can definitely do some things to give you that peace of mind. To start, can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with you specifically?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I feel… okay. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I walk a bit, you know, for exercise. Sales job keeps me moving too. I eat… normal food, I guess. Not fancy. I don’t smoke, never have. Used to drink a little beer, but not so much anymore. I just… worry. That’s the main thing. I worry I’m gonna end up like my mother and her sisters.
DOCTOR: I understand. Worry can certainly take a toll. It's good to hear you’re active and don’t smoke, and that you’ve cut back on alcohol – those are all positive things. When you say “tired sometimes,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. Not like, fall-down tired. Just… everything feels like it takes more effort. Getting up in the morning, walking up the stairs… little things. And sometimes, I feel a little… short of breath. Not when I’m doing anything hard, just… sometimes. It doesn’t happen every day, though. Maybe once or twice a week? It goes away after a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, fatigue with exertion, and occasional shortness of breath. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been… maybe six months now? Hard to say exactly. It started slowly, you know? Just thought I was getting old. But it’s been happening more often lately, so I thought maybe I should get it checked out. I don't want to be a bother, though. Doctor's are busy.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Schwer. It’s much better to get these things checked out, and you’re doing the right thing by coming in. Six months is a reasonable timeframe. Do you have any chest pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not at all. That’s good, right? Everything feels… okay in my chest. Just tired, like I said. Sometimes a little… fluttery feeling, but that doesn’t last long. Like a bird in my chest, maybe? It goes away quick. It doesn’t hurt, just… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, just occasional palpitations – that “fluttery” feeling. Good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I haven’t really paid attention. Let me see… … Maybe a little? It’s hard to tell. I wear these work boots all day, you know? They’re pretty tight. It could just be from those. I don't think so, but… maybe a little bit when I take them off at night. Not bad, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild swelling in the ankles, especially after wearing boots. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me something once, years ago. Said it was a little high, but he put me on a pill for a while. I stopped taking it after a few months. Didn’t seem to be doing much, and I didn’t like taking pills. I don’t think I have diabetes. Never been told that. Cholesterol… maybe? I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago. I mostly just go to the doctor when something hurts, you know? I don’t really get check-ups.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to only see a doctor when something is bothering you. It sounds like you may have had a previous diagnosis of high blood pressure, but haven't been regularly monitored. That's something we’ll definitely want to investigate. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing. Had to go to the hospital for that, got a cast. That was a long time ago. And… I had my appendix out when I was young too. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. No major surgeries or anything. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, appendectomy. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family, you mentioned heart trouble on your mother’s side. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, lots of it. My mother… she had a bad heart. She had… angina, I think they called it. Chest pain, mostly. She was always going to the doctor. She had to have a… a stent put in, I think. And then she had a… a stroke, a few years before she passed. My sister, she has high blood pressure too. And my aunt… she died young, from a heart attack. It runs in the family, you see? That’s why I’m so worried. I don’t want to end up like them. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is scary, Mr. Schwer, and it's good you’re taking this seriously. Knowing your family history is very important. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken pills for headaches and colds, you know, the usual stuff. Never had any problems. I’m pretty tough, I guess. I don’t get sick much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Mr. Schwer, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know if I’m okay. Go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart rate is a little fast, 88 beats per minute, and rhythm is regular. I can hear some normal heart sounds, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not loud, but we’ll want to investigate that further. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. That’s higher than we’d like to see. Next, I’ll check your pulse in your ankles and feet. The pulses are a little weak, but present. I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your hands and feet. Everything looks good there, no other noticeable abnormalities. Okay, Mr. Schwer. Based on this initial exam, your heart rate and blood pressure are a bit elevated, and there's a mild murmur, some mild ankle swelling and weaker pulses. These findings are concerning enough that I recommend some further testing to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be open to getting an EKG, some blood work, and possibly an echocardiogram?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. If those tests will tell us if I’m okay, then yes, absolutely. I trust your judgment. An EKG, blood work, and… what was the other one? Echo… something? As long as it will help figure things out. I just want to know if I need to worry. I don't want to end up like my mother, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. An echocardiogram, or echo for short, is an ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a detailed look at its structure and function. The blood work will check your cholesterol, kidney function, and other important levels. And the EKG will record your heart's electrical activity. These tests will help us determine if the murmur is significant, assess your risk of heart disease, and see if there are any underlying issues causing your symptoms. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now, and we can schedule the EKG and echocardiogram for later this week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Later this week is good. Whatever works best. I trust you to handle everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. I’ve been worrying about this for a long time. I just want to get it sorted out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad you came in. It's much better to address these concerns proactively. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, I’m going to write up some orders for the EKG and echocardiogram, and we’ll get those scheduled for you. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about managing high blood pressure – just some general tips on diet and exercise. While we wait for the test results, I want you to continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant swelling in your ankles or feet, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening, and for taking this seriously. I feel a little better already, just knowing we’re getting it checked out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. That's my job, and I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. We'll get to the bottom of this together. My nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, please relax and let me know if you need anything at all.
