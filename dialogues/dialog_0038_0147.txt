DOCTOR: Alright, Amy, good to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Auelua. Well, for the past few weeks, I've been noticing a lump... a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It's a bit concerning, and my wife suggested I get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen for a few weeks now. That's good of your wife to encourage you to come in – it's always best to get these things looked at. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not particularly painful, usually. Just a dull ache sometimes, and mostly I notice it when I’m, well, moving around. It feels… firm. Not squishy, if that makes sense. And it seems to be getting slightly bigger, though it could just be my imagination. I haven’t noticed any other changes, like with my bowel movements or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, firm, not squishy, and you've noticed it seems to be growing slowly. No changes in your bowel habits, that's good to know. A dull ache with movement. To get a better idea of what we're dealing with, could you point to roughly where the lump is located?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. Right about here is where I feel it most prominently. It’s not always easy to pinpoint, but this is the general area.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. That gives me a good starting point. And just to clarify, has there been any recent trauma to that area?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Nothing specific. I haven't had any falls or injuries in that region recently. I do a fair bit of walking as part of my choreography work, but nothing out of the ordinary. Just… regular movement, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent trauma. Choreography work, that's interesting. So it's potentially related to muscle strain, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, of course, but I haven’t had to use it much over the years. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing chronic or serious. My wife keeps me on a reasonably good diet, too, so I think that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Medicare is great to have. And a good diet is half the battle! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been quite lucky, all things considered. I’ve always been relatively robust, I suppose. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was younger, but nothing major. I've always tried to stay active, which I think has helped keep me healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That's very helpful to know. And staying active is definitely a plus. Now, thinking about your family... is there any history of cancer, particularly abdominal cancers, in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… My mother’s side of the family… I know my grandmother had some sort of illness, but I’m not entirely sure what it was. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t discuss medical things openly much in my family. My father’s side… I believe his brother had stomach problems, but again, I don’t have a lot of specifics. It wasn’t anything diagnosed as cancer, as far as I know. It’s all rather vague, unfortunately. I wish I had more information for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Vague family history is pretty common. It’s good you’ve thought about it, though. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything without issue, and I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to medications in the past. I’m quite fortunate in that regard as well, I suppose. My wife always double-checks when I’m given something new, just in case, but I’ve never had any problems.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies is very helpful. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps, but nothing regularly. No supplements, no prescriptions, nothing like that. I believe in letting my body heal naturally whenever it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That simplifies things nicely. Alright, Amy, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and then gently feel around to assess the lump more closely. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It will just be a quick listen to check for any unusual sounds. Okay, sounds are normal – no unusual bowel sounds or anything concerning there. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen – that just means I'll be feeling around to assess the lump and the surrounding area. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Alright. I do feel a firm mass, approximately 3 centimeters in diameter, located right where you described – slightly to the right of your navel. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, which is a good sign. It feels… relatively fixed, meaning it doesn’t move around a lot when I press on it. There's no rebound tenderness, which is also reassuring. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area either. Based on this initial examination, it’s difficult to say definitively what this mass is. It could be a number of things – a lipoma , a muscle strain, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible, Doctor. I understand it’s difficult to say without further investigation. Please, order whatever tests you deem necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your professional judgment. What kind of tests are you thinking of? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I was thinking we’ll start with a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. We'll also order a comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP, to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, I'd like to order an abdominal ultrasound. That will give us a much better image of the mass and help us determine what it is. The blood tests are relatively straightforward – just a simple blood draw. The ultrasound is painless and non-invasive – a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a handheld device to create an image of the underlying structures. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound… manageable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. When can I schedule the ultrasound? And how long will it take to get the results back from the blood tests? I’m quite happy to follow your instructions and get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write the orders for the lab work now. You can go to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital – they're open until 5 PM today, or anytime tomorrow. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you as soon as they’re available. As for the ultrasound, I've already put in a referral to the imaging center across the street. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment, usually within a day or two. They’re open Monday through Friday. I'm also going to print out a sheet of instructions about preparing for the ultrasound. It's fairly simple - generally, you don't need to do anything special, but it's good to be informed. Once we have the results from the blood work and the ultrasound, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that all sound good to you, Amy?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. St. Luke's Hospital and the imaging center across the street… convenient. And thank you for the instructions; I appreciate it. I’m happy to follow your plan. I trust your judgment completely. I’ll be sure to contact you if I have any questions in the meantime. Thank you for your time and your thorough examination. I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for now. It was a pleasure meeting you, Amy. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And try not to worry too much in the meantime. Have a good day.
