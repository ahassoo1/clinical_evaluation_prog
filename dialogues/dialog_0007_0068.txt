DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but please, call me Valerie. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Valerie. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up, and it started after… after the cancer stuff. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in the leg, and it started after your cancer treatment. That's definitely something we want to look into. Just to clarify – when you say “cancer stuff,” can you tell me what type of cancer you were treated for, and what treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… breast cancer. About, oh, five years ago now? I had… the surgery, of course. And then… radiation. A lot of radiation. And some pills too, but I don’t even remember the names of them. It was a while ago. Does that make sense? I'm not very good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sasha. Five years ago, breast cancer treated with surgery and radiation – that's very helpful. And it's perfectly normal not to remember all the medication names after a while. We can look those up in your records if that’s alright with you. Okay, I see here you were treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy following radiation. Now, focusing on the leg swelling – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, doxorubicin… yes, that rings a bell. It was… awful. Um… the swelling? It started… maybe a month ago? Slowly. At first, I thought it was just because I was on my feet too long, you know? I like to garden. But it’s not going away, and it’s getting… bigger. It’s mostly in my right leg. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely matters. Right leg swelling specifically, and starting about a month ago… okay. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been moving around. And if I sit for too long, it gets really bad. It feels… heavy. Like a stone. And sometimes… a little bit achy. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. I have to put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant swelling, worse with activity and prolonged sitting, feeling of heaviness and achiness… That gives me a clearer picture. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the right leg along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no redness. And it doesn’t feel warm. It just feels… puffy. And heavy, like I said. I’ve been trying to wear loose socks, but it doesn't really help much. It’s just… annoying. I just want it to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. No redness or warmth, just swelling and a feeling of heaviness. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or any changes in your urine output recently?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! No shortness of breath, thankfully. And no chest pain. My urine… I haven’t really noticed anything different about my pee, no. I mean, I go the same as always. Sorry, that’s… a little personal, isn’t it? But no, everything seems normal there. I just want to know if this leg is going to be alright.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Sasha. It's important to ask those questions. Okay, so no chest pain, shortness of breath, or changes in urine output. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better look at the leg. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first, just to rule out anything systemic, and then I’ll measure the circumference of both legs to see if there’s a significant difference in size. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. My heart… it’s been okay, I think. The doctors always listened to it before, during the cancer treatments. So, if it was bad, I guess they would have said something. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Now I’m going to measure the circumference of both your legs, just above and below the knee. Alright, the right leg is measuring 42 centimeters at the calf, and the left leg is 38 centimeters. There is a difference, a 4 centimeter difference, which explains the swelling you’re feeling. I also want to check the pulses in your feet. Pulses are good and strong in both feet. This is good news. Given your history of breast cancer and radiation treatment, and the unilateral leg swelling, it’s most likely lymphedema. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a deep vein thrombosis . I want to order a Duplex ultrasound of your right leg to assess the blood flow. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Lymp-a-what? And a… ultra-sound? Oh dear. Is that… painful? I don't like needles. I had enough of those during the cancer stuff. What does this ultra-sound do? And what is lymp-a-what? Is it serious? You're scaring me a little now. I just want my leg to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sasha, and I apologize if I’ve scared you. Let me explain everything. Lymphedema is swelling that happens when fluid builds up in the tissues because the lymphatic system isn’t working properly. The lymphatic system is like a network of vessels that helps remove waste and fluid from the body. Radiation treatment can sometimes damage these vessels, leading to lymphedema. It's not usually painful, but it can be uncomfortable, like you described. The ultrasound is a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve needles or any discomfort. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg, so we can see if there are any clots or blockages. It’s completely painless. We need to rule out a DVT, which is a blood clot in a deep vein, because that can be serious and requires immediate treatment. Do you feel a little better understanding what’s going on?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. So, it’s not like… new cancer? It’s just… the old cancer messing things up? And no needles? That’s good. A picture of the leg… that sounds alright. And you’re just making sure there’s no… what did you call it? A DVT? Yes, I feel a little better. A little. So, what happens after the picture? If it is just… lymp-a-what? What do you do about that? I don't want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not new cancer, it's a potential side effect of the radiation treatment. And no, no needles involved with the ultrasound. If the ultrasound shows no DVT, and everything else checks out, it’s most likely lymphedema. The good news is, lymphedema can be managed. There are several things we can do. First, we can start with compression therapy – wearing a special sleeve or stocking on your leg to help reduce the swelling. We can also recommend physical therapy, where a therapist can teach you exercises to help improve fluid drainage. There are also some lifestyle changes you can make, like elevating your leg when you're resting and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. I’m going to order the ultrasound now, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Compression… like a tight sock? And exercises… I can probably do exercises. I used to walk a lot. And… lifestyle changes. I guess I could try to sit less. That sounds… manageable. Yes, that sounds good. Order the… ultra-sound. And schedule the follow-up. Thank you, Valerie. You’ve explained everything very well. I feel much better now. Just… please, no more needles, okay?
