DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Claudene. I’m Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… these water things. They keep coming back. It’s a bother, really. I don’t quite recall when they started starting, exactly… just that it’s been a while. A bother, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Water things"... can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… uncomfortable, down there. Like when you really, really have to go, but it burns a little bit. And I have to go often. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, truly. I’ve been trying to drink more water, I think. Or maybe I haven’t. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to talk about. That sounds like it could be a urinary issue, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. When you say “often,” about how many times a day would you say you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s a tricky one. More than usual, I suppose. I wouldn’t say constantly, but… a lot. Maybe… six or seven times? Perhaps more on a bad day. I don't really count, you see. It's just… frequent. And it wakes me up at night sometimes, which is the worst part.
DOCTOR: Okay, six or seven times a day, and waking you up at night… alright. Do you have any pain while you’re urinating, or just the burning sensation you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sometimes a little ache, yes. Not a sharp pain, more… dull. And after I go, it feels like I haven't quite emptied everything, if that makes sense. It's a strange feeling. Like there’s still a little bit left, and it’s uncomfortable. I really don't know why this keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some dull ache with urination, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. And you said this has been happening for a while… have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Nothing really jumps to mind, truthfully. It just… happens. I thought maybe if I drank less tea, it would help, but I can't be certain. Or maybe more? I forget what I've tried. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat or drink, it’s all rather random. I do try to keep things… clean, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Alright, no clear triggers, and you try to maintain hygiene. Do you have a fever, any back pain, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh no, no fever. Back feels alright, thankfully. And no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Just… this irritation. It’s really just the water problem, Doctor. It's just… frustrating, because it keeps coming back, you see? I worry it’s something serious, but I can't really remember what the other doctor said about it last time.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good there’s no fever, back pain, or nausea. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for some time. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your abdomen and do a gentle pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh… well. I suppose. I don’t like them, truthfully. But if it will help… yes, alright. Just… be gentle, please. I’m a bit sensitive. And quickly, if you could?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and take some deep breaths. Then we’ll proceed with the pelvic exam. Okay. I’m listening now… abdomen sounds normal. Alright. I've completed the exam. I didn’t notice any major abnormalities, but I did feel some tenderness. Your bladder feels a little full even though you said you recently went. And I noticed some mild redness, which could indicate irritation. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for a possible urinary tract infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine test? Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. If it helps find out why this keeps happening, then yes. Is it painful? I don’t recall the last time I had one. And… what will it tell you, exactly? Will it finally put an end to this bother?
DOCTOR: It's a very simple test, Claudene. It won't be painful, just a little uncomfortable. You'll simply provide a urine sample in a cup. The lab will analyze it to check for bacteria, blood, and other things that could be causing your symptoms – like an infection, as we discussed. It can also tell us if there's sugar in your urine, which could point to other issues. I’ll have the nurse bring you a collection cup. Please try to collect a midstream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. Do you have any questions about how to do that?
PATIENT: Oh. Midstream… I remember something about that, I think. Start and… then collect the middle part. Yes. I believe I understand. Is there anything special I need to do beforehand? Should I drink a lot of water, or… not drink anything at all? I always get confused with these things.
DOCTOR: That's a good question! Just drink a normal amount of water – you don’t need to force yourself to drink a lot, but being adequately hydrated is helpful. And try to collect the sample within the next hour or so. After you've collected the sample, the nurse will take it to the lab, and we should have the results back within a couple of days. While we're waiting, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate the bladder. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Plenty of water, avoid tea and… alcohol. I don't drink much alcohol, thankfully. Just a small glass of sherry now and then. Water it is, then. And… what if it is an infection? What will you do? Will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: If the urinalysis shows an infection, the most likely course of action would be antibiotics – yes, pills. They're very effective at clearing up urinary tract infections. We’d start with a short course of antibiotics, usually around three to seven days, and I’d follow up with another urine test after you’ve finished them to make sure the infection is completely gone. However, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. It could be something else entirely, and we need those test results before we can make a definite diagnosis. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Pills… I suppose. I don't particularly like taking them, but if it will make me feel better… alright. I don't think I have any allergies, no. Not that I know of. I've taken… various things over the years. My stomach is a bit sensitive, sometimes, so I get heartburn easily. But no actual allergies. I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but some heartburn sensitivity – that’s good to know. I'll make a note of that. Alright, I’m going to have the nurse bring you the collection cup. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Just… get rid of this bother, if you can. And… thank you, Doctor. It's nice to finally be doing something about it. It's been… a while. Please hurry with the test, if you could.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. I understand how frustrating this can be. We’ll get the test processed as quickly as possible, and we’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. The nurse will be right in with the collection cup. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you develop a fever, back pain, or any severe discomfort. Have a good day, and we'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
