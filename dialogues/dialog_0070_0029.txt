DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… eating thing. I just don't seem to be able to eat much these days. Get full awful quick, even with just a little bit of food. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. Not sure what to make of it.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite and feel full rather quickly, even with small portions. And this has been happening for several weeks now, you said?
PATIENT: That’s right. Not that I was a big eater to begin with, you understand. Always been a bit on the slight side. But even less than usual now. My wife, bless her heart, keeps offering me second helpings, thinks I’m losing weight, but I just… can’t. It’s not that I don't want to, it's just… too much, too soon. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. It sounds frustrating. And your wife is concerned about weight loss, which is good of her. Has there been any unintentional weight loss that you’ve noticed, or is it mostly her observation?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. My wife does have a scale. She says I'm down a few pounds. Not a lot, but enough to worry her, she says. I just feel… lighter, I suppose. Hard to say if it’s muscle or… something else. I haven’t been feeling any weaker, mind you. Still managing to get around and do my usual things. Mostly just puttering in the garden, and some work with the radio station, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, some noticed weight loss, but no significant change in your strength or energy levels. And you're still able to maintain your usual activities – gardening and work at the radio station – which is good. Could you describe what a typical meal looks like for you these days?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually just toast and a little bit of tea. Maybe an egg if I'm feeling up to it. Lunch… maybe a sandwich, cut in half. And dinner, well, my wife makes lovely meals, roast chicken, salmon, that sort of thing, but I usually just have a small portion. A few bites, really. I try to eat something with her, don’t want her feeling bad, but it’s just… hard to get through much of it. I used to enjoy a good plate of mashed potatoes, but now… just a few spoonfuls and I’m done. It’s a shame, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, smaller portions across all meals, and a feeling of fullness comes on relatively quickly. Do you experience any other symptoms with the feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No pain, no bloating, no… upset stomach. Just… full. Sometimes a bit of a tired feeling afterwards, but that could just be from not eating much, I suppose. And no heartburn or anything like that. Just… stubbornly full. It's a peculiar thing, really. I’ve never had anything like it before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound peculiar, Mr. Obarr. No associated pain, bloating, nausea, or heartburn. Just early satiety and fullness. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, truth be told. Had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. No major operations, no chronic conditions like diabetes or heart trouble. I go to the dentist regularly, but that's about it. My wife keeps trying to get me to see a specialist about my knees, they ache a bit after gardening, but I just put up with it. Old age, I figure. But no… nothing else. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant past medical history, no surgeries, and you haven’t been experiencing any chronic health conditions. You mentioned some knee discomfort, but otherwise, you’ve been generally healthy. Have you ever had any reactions to medications or allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctors have given me. My wife always asks if I'm allergic to anything before they give me a shot, and I always say no. I can eat all sorts of foods, no problems there. No trouble with pollen or anything like that either. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies or medication sensitivities. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, a strong woman she was. She didn’t have much in the way of health problems, just a bit of arthritis in her later years. My father passed away when I was quite young, heart trouble, I believe. My brother… he had high blood pressure, but that was about it. No cancer in the family, that I know of, and no history of stomach problems or anything like that. Mostly just… good, sturdy folks. They lived simple lives, you know? Not much in the way of fancy illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A family history of some heart trouble with your father, and generally healthy otherwise. And finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Hmm. Well, I’ve been married to my wife, Elsie, for 63 years now. We live here in town, been here all our lives. I used to work at the logging camp when I was younger, but retired years ago. Now, I volunteer at the local radio station, mostly playing old music and reading the news. I don't smoke, never have. Drink a little bit of tea, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly, just a quiet life. Not much excitement, but I enjoy it. I don't travel much, mostly stay close to home. That's about it, really. A simple life, as I said.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Obarr. That gives me a good understanding of your background. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel your neck. This will help me get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding if it helps. Always figured a good doctor needs to listen to what the body has to say, and that's what you're doing, isn't it? Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and no masses are palpable. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness. Your lymph nodes are normal in size and consistency. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, which makes this a bit more puzzling. However, given your symptoms – early satiety and unintentional weight loss – and the fact that it’s been going on for several weeks, I think it's important to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These will help us rule out some potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests, eh? Well, I suppose that's the next step, isn't it? I don't much like needles, but if it helps figure out what's going on, I'm willing. So yes, go ahead and order them. What sort of things are you looking for, Doctor? Just so I have an idea.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Obarr. The complete blood count will look for any signs of anemia or infection. The comprehensive metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. And the thyroid-stimulating hormone level will assess your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause changes in appetite and weight. I'm also considering the possibility of something going on with your digestive system, even though you haven't mentioned any significant abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits. Sometimes, subtle changes can be early signs of a problem. So, I might also order a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infection. Do those tests sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Well, that all sounds… thorough, Doctor. A bit worrying, to be honest, but I suppose that’s what you’re supposed to do, isn’t it? Check everything. A stool test… now that sounds a bit unpleasant. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, go ahead. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. So yes, let’s do all the tests. When will I get the results, Doctor? And will I need to come back for another visit?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Obarr. It’s always better to be thorough. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results. I expect we’ll have them back within a week. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and ordering the tests. It's a bit unsettling, not knowing what's going on, but I feel better knowing that we're trying to figure it out. Just one thing… will the tests tell us if it’s something… serious? I’m not trying to be morbid, just… trying to prepare myself, you understand. Elsie will be worried sick if it’s bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Obarr. It’s natural to be worried, and it's good that you're thinking about Elsie. The tests will help us rule out a number of potential causes, ranging from relatively minor issues to more serious conditions. It's too early to say definitively what’s going on, and I don't want to cause unnecessary anxiety. However, the weight loss is the most concerning symptom, and that's why we’re doing these tests. We'll discuss the results in detail when they come back, and I'll explain all your options. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here's a lab requisition for the blood tests and stool sample. The lab is located at [address of lab]. Do you need directions?
PATIENT: No, I know where the lab is, thank you. Been going there for years for Elsie's check-ups. Alright, then. I’ll get these tests done as soon as I can and wait for your call. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little, knowing that you're taking this seriously. I think that’s everything. I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help, even a little. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, take care of yourself. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr.
