DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor… Fourney, you say? Good to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she wants… a baby. We… old now. She think maybe… need help? I not so sure. We been married long time, but… not easy anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. A baby. Well, sir, with all due respect, at your age… and your wife’s, I suspect this is… complicated. But we’ll approach this systematically. Just to be clear, is your wife currently pregnant or trying to become pregnant?
PATIENT: No, no pregnant. Not now. She… she think about it. Talk, talk, talk. About maybe… trying. But she worry. She say… old eggs. That what she say. I… I just come with her. She want me to… check. Make sure I… okay for this. I feel fine, you know? But… I not remember everything so good. She do most the thinking.
DOCTOR: “Old eggs,” yes. We’ll certainly address that. It's good she's thinking proactively. Now, Mr. Carlotta, let’s focus on you for a moment. You said you feel fine, which is excellent. But “fine” can mean a lot of things. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy… hmm. Not so much change. Always a little tired, you know? Old man. But nothing… special. Not more tired than usual. I work with… the metal. And the plastic. Making small things. It good work. Keep hands busy. Maybe that why I not so tired. It… keeps me moving. She say I work too much. But I like it. It… distracts me.
DOCTOR: Distraction is… understandable. And yes, physical activity can certainly help with energy levels. Now, Mr. Carlotta, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical… I go to doctor sometimes. For check-ups. They say my… pressure, little high. But I take pills for that. Small orange pills. And… I think I had something… with the water once. Long time ago. Not remember what they call it. Nothing bad, though. She always tell the doctors everything. I forget. She remember. Medicare pay for it all, thankfully. It… expensive, you know? Doctors.
DOCTOR: Right. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And a possible past illness. Do you recall when this illness occurred?
PATIENT: When…? Oh, goodness. Long time ago. Very long time ago. Before… before we move here, maybe? We lived… other place. Different country. Lots of water there. I… I think when I was younger. Before the pills. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or more? I’m not so good with dates. She always know the dates. It… very confusing, you know? Remembering things. I just… feel better now. It was not so bad. Just… sick for a little while. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a possible water-borne illness over twenty years ago. Do you know what kind of symptoms you had at that time?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I feel… funny now, just thinking about it. It was… stomach upset, maybe? And… tired. Very tired. And… I think I had fever. But not so high. She… she took care of me. She made me tea. And… something with the rice? I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago, doctor. It was… not good, but I get better. She… she said I shouldn’t drink so much water from the… well, from everywhere. She always worry about the water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stomach upset, fever, and fatigue. We'll note that. Now, Mr. Carlotta, are you currently taking any medications besides the orange pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Orange pills, yes. She give me something for my… hands sometimes. For the metal work. They hurt. Joints, she say. Small white pills. And… sometimes, a little blue one for… sleeping. Not every night. When I… worry too much. But she keep track of them. She write it all down. I just… take them. She know everything, doctor. She is very good with… remembering things. And… pills. It's all a little blurry, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta. Orange pills for blood pressure, white pills for your hands, and blue pills for sleeping. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That a hard one. We… not see family much. Long distance. Different country, like I say. My mother… she live long time. Very long time. But she… not good at the end. Something with her… breathing. I think. My father… he work with the land. Strong man. He… fall, maybe? I don’t remember so good. They both… gone now. She… she know more about family things. She keep the pictures. And… the stories. It’s all… very far away. I just… remember they were strong people. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Let’s move on to social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, no. Not alcohol. Never like it. Make me feel… funny. And smoke… no, never smoke. Bad for the lungs, she say. And… drugs? Oh, no. I work with the metal, that's enough excitement for me. Quiet man, I am. Mostly. She… she make sure I stay healthy. She read all the… leaflets. About staying safe. And… not doing bad things. I just… follow her instructions. I’m a good husband, you know? Mostly. Quiet and good. She… she worry about everything. She is very good at… keeping me in line.
DOCTOR: Right. Very good. So, no alcohol, no smoking, no recreational drugs. Now, before I proceed, I need to ask you a rather personal question, Mr. Carlotta. Have you noticed any changes in your… sexual function recently?
PATIENT: Oh… oh, goodness. Doctor, that… that not something you ask. That… private. My wife… she does not like me talk about such things. That between her and me. I… I work with the metal, I make small things. That's what I do. That… not important for the baby. She… she is the one who want a baby. I just come with her, to check I’m… okay. That all. You… you ask too many questions, doctor. Questions… not polite. I think… I want to go now. She… she will be wondering.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. I apologize if I’ve offended you. It’s simply my duty to gather a thorough medical history. Given your wife's desire to conceive, it is important to assess all factors. However, I respect your privacy. I am concerned about your memory issues and the fragmented nature of your medical history. It’s crucial we determine the underlying cause. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a cognitive evaluation. I also suggest a more detailed discussion with your wife regarding her concerns and expectations. I will write a referral for the neurologist and a note outlining my concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Neurologist…? Oh, goodness. More doctors? She will be upset. She say I already see too many. But… alright. If she say, I will go. She always know best. And… questions? Hmm… just… will this help the baby? Is this… important for the baby? If it not important for the baby, I don’t want to bother. She… she really want this baby. She talk about it all the time. So… if it help her… I will go. Thank you, doctor. But… maybe just the neurologist? No more questions, please. She… she will be wondering. I need to go home now. To my wife. She… she will be worried.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. Just the neurologist, then. I understand. I will schedule the appointment for you as soon as possible. Here is the referral form. Please take it with you. We'll contact you regarding the details. I wish you and your wife all the best. And please encourage her to be open and honest with the neurologist. That's the most important thing. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for your time. .
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You… you are very kind. I just… want to make my wife happy. She… she deserve a happy life. A baby… that would make her very happy. Thank you again. .
