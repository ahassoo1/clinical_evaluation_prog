DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful, really. It comes and goes, but when it is here…I can barely get out of my chair. And the young man at the lab said something about…kin-ease? Is that right? Something’s wrong with that. Honestly, I don’t keep up with all these things. It's just…exhausting, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness that comes and goes, and it's really debilitating when it's here. And you mentioned something about a lab result… “kin-ease”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Creatine…kinase, I think he said. Sounded very important, the way he went on. I’ve never had anything like this before, and honestly, I don’t recall why they even checked it. Just…a lot of poking and prodding, then a phone call saying I needed to come see someone. It's probably nothing, but my husband, bless his heart, gets very worried. He insisted I make an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, so creatine kinase was elevated on some recent blood work. Let's try to piece this together. When did you have these blood tests done, do you recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dates… that’s always a trouble. Let me think… it was…after I helped my grandson with… well, with moving some furniture. Yes! He got a new sofa. A very heavy one. I think it was… maybe a week ago? Or was it two? Everything just blurs together after a while, you know. I just remember feeling rather proud of myself for helping, and then feeling absolutely dreadful for the next few days. That’s when they called about the tests, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the blood tests were done roughly a week or two after you helped your grandson move a heavy sofa, and you felt tired and unwell afterwards. That’s helpful. And besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my muscles feel… achy, sometimes. Not like a pulled muscle, just… weak and sore. And I've been a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropped a teacup just yesterday. My husband scolded me, said I wasn't paying attention. He’s always telling me what I’m doing wrong. But besides that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing terribly noticeable. It’s mostly just this… dragging feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and feeling clumsier, along with the tiredness. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your strength and reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it's necessary. I suppose poking and prodding can’t hurt. Though I do wish doctors wouldn’t make such a fuss. I've lived a long life, you know. And I’ve always been… reasonably healthy. But go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get it over with. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your muscle strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Here. Though I doubt I have much strength left these days. All this… weakness, you know. It’s a vicious cycle. I try my best, but it’s probably not what it used to be. Are you getting a good reading? Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m just… fading away.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Your strength is a bit lower than expected, but it’s relatively equal on both sides, which is good. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap lightly on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a bit strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Alright. Your reflexes are a little slower than usual, but again, that’s not necessarily cause for alarm. Finally, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Everything sounds good there, too. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Let me just document these findings. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing tiredness and muscle aches, which started after helping your grandson move furniture. Your muscle strength and reflexes are a little diminished, but everything else seems normal on this quick exam. Your elevated creatine kinase is the most concerning part, given your symptoms. Now, there are a few possibilities here. It could be simple muscle damage from the strain of lifting, which is common. But we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. "Rule out other causes"? What other causes? Is it something serious, Doctor? I told you, I’ve just been a bit tired. Perhaps I overdid it with the furniture. My grandson is a strong boy, but that sofa was heavy. Don’t tell me it's something dreadful, like…like my heart giving out? I don't want any more poking and prodding, honestly. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about and… and if I should stop helping my grandson. He'll be disappointed, but I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried when you hear about lab results and potential causes. I don’t want to alarm you, and it's unlikely it’s something as serious as your heart giving out, given your normal heart sounds and lung sounds. However, elevated creatine kinase can be caused by several things, and we need to investigate further to be sure. Muscle damage from strain is the most common cause, as you suggested, and that's what I suspect, but other possibilities include certain medications, thyroid problems, or, rarely, a muscle condition. To rule those other things out, I’d like to order a few more blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, kidney function, and vitamin D levels. These are relatively simple tests, and they will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More blood tests. It's always something, isn't it? Well, I suppose if you think it's necessary. I just wish my body would cooperate. But yes, alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? And can you tell me how long it will take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks on end, worrying about… what did you say it was? Thyroid? What’s wrong with my thyroid? I don’t even know what that does. Honestly, sometimes I think I’m just falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle when drawing the blood. And I promise I'll get these results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days. Your thyroid is a gland in your neck that produces hormones that control your metabolism – basically, how your body uses energy. It can affect your energy levels, muscle strength, and many other things. That's why we want to check it, just to be sure it's functioning properly. It's a common test and often comes back normal, so please don't worry too much. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next few days. Let your muscles rest and see if your symptoms improve. If you experience any new symptoms, like severe muscle pain, dark urine, or difficulty breathing, please call my office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. No heavy lifting. I can manage that, I suppose. My grandson will just have to find someone else to help him. He's a good boy, but he does like to take advantage of my willingness to help. And 2-3 days… well, that’s better than weeks, I suppose. I’ll try not to worry too much. Though it’s hard, you know? Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart. Just… promise me you’ll call me right away if anything is seriously wrong. I don’t want any surprises. And… is there anything else I need to do? Any special diet or… anything? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise I will call you immediately if anything concerning comes up. And you're right, getting older isn't always easy. For now, there aren’t any specific dietary changes you need to make. Just continue to eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated. It’s also a good idea to get plenty of rest. Here’s a summary of what we’ve discussed: Avoid heavy lifting. Get blood tests to check thyroid function, kidney function, and vitamin D levels. Rest and stay hydrated. Call my office immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe muscle pain, dark urine, or difficulty breathing. I’m also going to print out a handout with more information about elevated creatine kinase and potential causes, just so you have something to refer to. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you. A handout… yes, that will be helpful. I always forget everything the moment I leave the office. Hmm… All these big words… it’s a bit much for me, honestly. But I’ll try to read it. No, I don’t think so. I suppose that covers everything. Just… please call if something is wrong. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And thank you for being patient with an old woman like me. I know I’m not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not difficult at all, Ardelle. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to call if you think of any questions later, even if it’s just to clarify something on the handout. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’m confident we can get you feeling better soon. Have a good day, and please take it easy. .
