DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife helped me set this up. I… honestly, I don’t remember all the details right now. Something about checking if I'm okay for it? It's bariatric surgery, right? She said something like that.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery, yes. It’s good you’re taking initiative, though relying solely on your wife for details isn’t ideal. We need to establish whether you are a suitable candidate, and that requires your input. Let’s start with a bit of background. How long have you been considering this surgery, and what prompted you to look into it now?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time, I think. Maybe a year? It’s… hard to say. I just… get tired easily, you know? Everything is a bit of a struggle. My wife… she worries about my health. That’s a big part of it. She’s the one who really started looking into things and found this clinic. I just… agreed it seemed like a good idea. I don’t really remember why exactly, just that it felt… necessary. Does that make sense? I'm sorry I'm not very clear.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Kochubey. Though frankly, a lack of clarity regarding a major surgical decision is concerning. We need to understand your motivations and expectations. Let's try this: What specific difficulties are you experiencing due to your weight?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Difficulties. Well… walking is hard, like I said. Especially uphill. And… getting out of breath, just doing normal things. Bending over… that’s tough. My knees hurt a lot. And… I feel tired all the time, even after sleeping. It’s… embarrassing, really. I used to be able to do more. I used to play soccer with my kids, but… not anymore. It's just too much. I have trouble keeping up with them now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Walking difficulties, shortness of breath, knee pain, and persistent fatigue. These are all potential indicators. Now, let's get a more complete picture. Have you tried any weight loss programs or lifestyle changes – diet, exercise – before considering surgery?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, a few. My wife, she’s really good with that stuff. We tried… a lot of diets. The grapefruit diet, some kind of juice cleanse… I don’t really remember the names. And… walking, I guess. But it never lasted very long. I’d start, feel good for a week, then… just get discouraged. It’s hard. Really hard. And the diets… they were always so restrictive. I’d get hungry all the time. I'm not very good at sticking to things, I guess. It's a bad habit.
DOCTOR: "Not very good at sticking to things," you say. That is… suboptimal. Bariatric surgery is not a quick fix, Mr. Kochubey, it’s a significant lifestyle change, requiring sustained commitment. Let’s move on. Do you have any medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife usually handles all that. She might know better. I… I don’t really have any regular check-ups or anything. I just… haven’t needed them, usually. Does high blood pressure count? She mentioned that once, but I don't take any pills for it. It wasn’t very bad, I think. I really don’t remember. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: "All a bit fuzzy," you repeat. Very well. Let's review your family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, obesity, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… my dad, he had heart problems. I think. He… passed away a few years ago. And my mom, she… she's overweight. Always has been. And… I think my uncle had diabetes. But… that was a long time ago. It’s… hard to remember exactly. We didn't really talk about health much, to be honest. It was… considered a private thing. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. I’m really trying to remember, but it’s just… not coming to me.
DOCTOR: A lack of detailed family medical history is… unfortunate, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife wouldn’t allow it, even if I wanted to. She's very strict about those things. I… I do drink sometimes. Just a beer or two with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing much. Not regularly. Just… social drinking, I guess. Mostly with my friends when we get together. It's not a habit or anything. Does that count? I really don't think it's a problem.
DOCTOR: “Social drinking,” you say. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. Like I said before, I haven’t really needed anything. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. But that's it. Nothing regular. And… definitely no supplements. My wife is against all that stuff. She says it's a waste of money. So, no. Nothing. I'm pretty sure. Unless… does that little cough drop count? I had a cold last week, and used a few of those. But that's not a medicine, right?
DOCTOR: A cough drop is not a medication of significance, Mr. Kochubey. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Please undress down to your underwear, and I'll get started. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Uh… no, no objections. That’s fine. Whatever you need. Just… give me a moment. It’s just… a little embarrassing. I haven’t been undressed in front of a doctor in… a long time. Okay. Just let me know when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Please lie back on the table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is elevated – 150/90. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. There is some mild tenderness in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Moderate subcutaneous fat present. BMI is calculated at 34. Weight is 139 pounds, height is 155 centimeters. Obese, Class I. Range of motion in knees is limited with crepitus. Refexes are normal. Alright. That’s all for the physical examination. Please get dressed. We'll discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks, Doctor. So… what happens next? Is it a good sign that my heart sounds were… normal? I’m just… worried. My wife says I need this, but I'm just… unsure. And I keep forgetting things, like you said. It's really frustrating. I'm hoping you can help me figure out what to do. What are the “next steps”? Is there a test or something?
DOCTOR: “Normal” heart sounds are… adequate, Mr. Kochubey, but elevated blood pressure is a concern. As for “next steps,” we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weight and potentially complicate surgery. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We'll also need an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to assess your heart function more thoroughly. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. I’m also going to order a consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate your elevated blood pressure. Frankly, Mr. Kochubey, your lack of a comprehensive medical history and your reliance on your wife for details are concerning. It’s imperative that you become actively involved in your healthcare. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. I understand. That’s… a lot of tests. And a cardiologist? Okay. I… I’ll try. I’ll really try to remember things better. And… I’ll ask my wife to help me write things down, maybe. I'm sorry. I just… I get flustered easily. And it's hard to remember everything. What does the cardiologist do, exactly? And… how long will all this take? I have a job… I can’t be away for too long.
DOCTOR: The cardiologist, Mr. Kochubey, will evaluate your heart health in more detail, given your elevated blood pressure. They may order additional tests, such as a stress test or an echocardiogram. As for timing, the tests should be scheduled within the next week. The cardiologist appointment will likely be within the next two to three weeks. I will have the lab orders and cardiologist referral sent to the front desk. They will contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend you begin a low-sodium diet and increase your physical activity, even if it's just a short walk each day. This will help lower your blood pressure and prepare you for surgery, should you be deemed a suitable candidate. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Uh… questions? I… I guess so. What kind of low-sodium diet? I don’t even know where to start. And… is there anything I should be avoiding completely? Like, certain foods? And… what if the cardiologist says my heart isn't good enough for surgery? What then? I’m… getting nervous again.
DOCTOR: A low-sodium diet means avoiding processed foods, fast food, canned goods, and excessive table salt. Read food labels carefully – aim for less than 2300 milligrams of sodium per day, ideally closer to 1500 milligrams. Avoid adding salt to your meals while cooking or at the table. I’m printing you a handout with a list of low-sodium foods and recipes. As for what happens if the cardiologist deems you unsuitable for surgery… that depends on the severity of the heart condition. We may need to focus on managing your blood pressure and other health concerns before considering surgery. In some cases, surgery may not be an option. However, we won’t know until we receive the cardiologist’s report. It is crucial to follow the cardiologist’s recommendations diligently. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yes. I understand. Low sodium, follow the cardiologist. It's… a lot to take in. Okay. I… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I'll… I'll try my best. Can I… can I go now? I need to talk to my wife. About all this. And… maybe start looking at salt labels.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. The front desk will schedule your appointments. Remember, active participation in your healthcare is essential, Mr. Kochubey. Please follow up with me if you have any questions or concerns. .
