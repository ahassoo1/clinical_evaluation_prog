DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Delacour. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting chills, and it’s kinda weird. Not a fever, just… cold. It started a couple of days ago, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. Chills without a fever are certainly something we should investigate. Could you describe the chills for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not like when you’re sick with a fever, you know? It's more… like a shiver that just comes over me. Sometimes it’s just my arms, sometimes it’s my whole body. And it doesn’t last long, just a few minutes, then it’s gone. Then it comes back later. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Aslan. It sounds distinct from fever-related chills. And you mentioned it comes and goes over the past couple of days?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It’s not constant. Yesterday it happened maybe three times? And today, I think just once so far, a little while ago, actually. I was just sitting and reading, and bam, cold. It wasn’t freezing in the room or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. And aside from these chills, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying them?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No cough, no sore throat, no headache. I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But honestly, I'm usually a bit tired. I work a lot. I haven't noticed anything else that feels different, just the chills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: I’m a Health Education Specialist. I go around to different community centers and schools and teach people about… well, all sorts of health stuff. Nutrition, exercise, preventative care, that sort of thing. It's a lot of driving and talking, so maybe that's why I’m tired. But like I said, I'm usually tired. It's not more tired than usual.
DOCTOR: That's a very important job, Ms. Aslan. It sounds physically demanding, certainly. Now, let's move on to a more comprehensive overview. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, but that was years ago and healed up fine. Nothing serious, nothing chronic. I see my dentist regularly, get my check-ups, that sort of thing. I'm pretty healthy, usually. This chill thing is just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm, and they just put it in a cast. It wasn’t a bad break.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family, do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mom has high blood pressure, but she’s managing it with medication. And my grandmother, on my dad’s side, had diabetes, but she passed away a few years ago. Other than that, not really. Everyone else seems pretty healthy. Nothing that runs in the family that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And sometimes, if I get a headache, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing regular. I try to stay away from meds if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, thankfully! Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Aslan, could you please tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. I'm… about 5’0” – 5’1”, maybe? And I weigh around 150 pounds. I know, I need to lose some weight, but it’s hard with my job!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Aslan. That is helpful information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and briefly examine your skin. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing these chills. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I guess… where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind, please have a seat here, and I'll begin by taking your temperature and blood pressure. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your sweater, if you're comfortable doing so, so I can listen properly. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also normal. Now, if you’ll take a deep breath for me… Your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No, nothing feels tender. Everything feels… normal, honestly. Which is frustrating! That's why I came in. It's just these chills… they come and go, and it’s so random. I feel fine, then bam, cold. And then it’s gone.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Aslan. The lack of other symptoms is perplexing. Given your normal vital signs and physical examination, we need to consider what could be causing these chills without any accompanying fever or other signs of infection. Several possibilities exist, ranging from benign to less common conditions. It could be related to stress, dehydration, or even a mild thyroid imbalance. Another possibility, though less likely given the absence of other symptoms, is early stages of a viral infection. To further investigate, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. The CBC will help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammation, and the TSH level will assess your thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I hate feeling… off, you know? Especially with my job, I need to be feeling my best. So, yes, please order those tests. How long will it take to get the results? And do I need to do anything special to prepare?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Aslan. I understand. Feeling unwell when you need to be at your best is never ideal. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to return. The lab will send the results directly to our clinic. I will review them as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss the findings and next steps. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the blood draw. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. Just try to stay hydrated. Our nurse will draw the blood right here in the clinic before you leave. In the meantime, if the chills worsen or you develop any other symptoms like a fever, cough, sore throat, or body aches, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and trying to figure this out. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I’m glad I could help. Let's proceed with the blood draw then, and we will take it from there. I assure you, we will investigate this thoroughly. The nurse will be with you shortly to take your blood. Please let her know if you have any concerns or feel faint during the procedure.
