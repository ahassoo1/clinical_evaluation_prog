DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, have a seat. Look, I’m Audel Pehrson, Doctor. I’ve got a pretty full schedule today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s Norval, by the way. Norval Obarr. What brings me in… it's my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Even if I don’t eat much, I just… stop feeling hungry, and then I’m stuffed. It’s been going on for a few months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Full awful quick,” you say. A few months… right. And how much is “not much” when you’re eating?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. It’s hard to say exactly. I used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and rice, you know? Now? Maybe half a plate, and I’m done. Sometimes even less. It's just… not enjoyable anymore, trying to eat. My wife makes a lovely stew, but I can barely get a bowl down.
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, a noticeable decrease in your appetite and… early satiety, is what we call it. Half a plate is significantly less than you used to eat. Any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Not at all. And not really nausea, either. Just… that fullness. It’s like there’s no room, even when there is room, I guess. It’s a strange feeling. I don’t get heartburn or anything like that, either. Just… full. Too full, too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay. No nausea, no vomiting, no heartburn. Just early satiety. And this is happening with most foods, not just specific things?
PATIENT: Pretty much everything, yeah. Doesn’t matter if it’s my wife’s stew, a sandwich, or even just a little bit of toast. It's all the same. I thought maybe it was the stew at first, figured she was adding something different, but… nope. It's everything. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Alright. So consistent early satiety across all food types for several months now. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss along with this?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yeah, a little bit. My wife keeps saying my pants are getting looser. I haven't weighed myself, but she’s usually pretty good at noticing these things. She worries, you know? I haven't been feeling bad, just not hungry. But I guess losing weight isn't good.
DOCTOR: Right. Unintentional weight loss is concerning. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, feel your stomach, and check for any… abnormalities. Just lie back on the table for me. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels… weird, okay? I'm not a fan of doctors poking around, if you know what I mean. But I trust you, Doctor. Just want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breaths. Not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness. Bowel sounds are… present, but a little diminished. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Just… feels a bit empty, maybe? Like there's nothing in there. It’s hard to explain. Not like a sharp pain, just… hollow. Oh, wait… that spot. That feels a little… sensitive. Not awful, but definitely something there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sensitivity in that area… Alright. Okay, Mr. Obarr, given your age, the unintentional weight loss, the early satiety, and now this tenderness… I’m going to order some blood work. We need to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and also a CA 19-9 marker. It's just a precaution, to rule things out. And I'm going to order an abdominal CT scan, to get a better look at things.
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds serious. What are we… ruling out, Doctor? I don't want to get all worried for no reason. Is it something bad? I just want to get back to enjoying my wife’s stew, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Obarr, I understand your concern. I'm not going to speculate. We're ruling out a range of possibilities. It could be something simple, like a minor digestive issue. But given your symptoms and age, it's best to be thorough. The CT scan will give us a clearer picture. It's a precaution, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. A precaution. Right. That makes… a little more sense. Alright. What do I need to do for the blood work and the scan? And how long will it take to get the results? My wife's going to be worried sick, you know? She always worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for eight hours beforehand – no food or drinks except water. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. The CT scan will require a contrast dye, so we’ll need to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly first, which the blood work will help determine. As for results… typically, the blood work comes back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results can take a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days. I'll have the receptionist schedule everything for you and give you detailed instructions. Here are the orders. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And try not to worry too much. We're just being proactive.
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting. Got it. And the lab is in Room 3. 3-5 business days… that seems like a long time. But alright. Proactive. I can handle that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I just want to get back to normal. I'll let my wife know.
