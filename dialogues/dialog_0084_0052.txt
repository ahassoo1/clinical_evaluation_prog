DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to ye, Doctor. Aye, well, it's this queasy feeling I've been havin’ most mornings, now. It's not a proper sick feeling, more like… a turnin’ in my stomach, ye ken? And I've got this heart bother, and I just wanted to make sure the two weren't linked, like.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A queasy stomach in the mornings and some heart bother. Let's unpack that a little. How long have you been experiencing this queasy feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think now… It started maybe three weeks ago, give or take a few days. At first, I just thought it was somethin’ I ate, but it’s been stickin’ around, and it's nearly every mornin’ now. Not a violent sickness, mind ye, just enough to put me off my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks, nearly every morning, not severe but enough to affect your appetite. And this "heart bother," can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Aye, right ye are. Well, it’s not a pain, exactly. More of a… a flutterin', sometimes. Like a wee bird trapped in my chest. And I get a bit breathless with it, especially if I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shops. It’s been goin’ on for…oh, I’d say six months now, on and off. It used to be just when I was exertin’ myself, but lately it seems to be comin’ on easier.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fluttering sensation in your chest, sometimes with breathlessness, for about six months. It's becoming more frequent, even with less exertion. Do you feel any pain or pressure in your chest along with the fluttering?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no real pain. It’s not a sharp ache or anythin’ like that. Sometimes I feel a wee bit of tightness, like a band around my chest when the flutterin’s bad, but it doesn't last long. It's more disconcerting than painful, if ye understand. It just…feels wrong, ye ken? Makes me worry.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Benic. Feeling "wrong" is a good way to put it, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to get it checked out. Let’s go through some other things to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you have any other symptoms—anything else you've noticed that’s changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, aye. And my ankles are lookin' a bit puffy at the end of the day. I put it down to the heat, mostly, but it's been happenin' more often lately. Oh, and I've had to get up a couple of times in the night to…well, to use the bathroom. Not a lot, but more than I used to. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important. Increased fatigue, puffy ankles, and getting up to urinate more often at night…Okay. Do you have any past medical conditions that you know of - anything you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, there’s a bit of a history, I’m afraid. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, nearly thirty years ago now, but I recovered well from that. And the doctor told me a few years back, maybe five or six years ago, that I had a slightly enlarged heart. He said it wasn't anything to worry about at the time, just to keep an eye on it. I've seen a specialist once or twice, had some tests done. I think it was somethin’ about the muscle being a bit thick, but I’m not one for rememberin’ medical terms. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, pneumonia in the past, a slightly enlarged heart with thickened muscle - we’ll need to look at those records. Appendix removal is good to know. Any surgeries besides the appendix?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the appendix, when I was a wee boy. Nothing else. And I don’t take any regular medication, not a thing. I used to take a tablet for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it when it started to come down on its own. I try to eat well, mostly, and I walk when I can, although the hill's been a bit of a challenge lately. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a wee glass of whisky on Christmas.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other surgeries, no current medications, and you used to take something for blood pressure. Let’s talk about family history. Are there any heart problems, diabetes, or other significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Aye, there is, unfortunately. My father, he had a bad heart. He had a heart attack when he was about 60, and he didn’t recover well from it. And my mother, she had diabetes, later in life. My sister, she's got high blood pressure, but she's doin’ okay with tablets for it. And my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a stroke, I believe. It was a long time ago, before my time, but I remember my mother talkin' about it. Does that give ye anythin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite helpful. Heart attack in your father, diabetes in your mother, high blood pressure in your sister and a stroke in your grandfather. Okay, and lastly, are you allergic to anything - any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never had any allergic reactions, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anythin’. I’ve got a sensitive nose, maybe, a bit of hayfever in the summer, but that’s all. No proper allergies. I think I've told ye everything I can think of, Doctor. I hope it's enough? I'm a bit worried, I must admit.
DOCTOR: You’ve told me a great deal, Mr. Benic, thank you. It is good you’ve provided all that information; it gives me a much better understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles to see if there's any swelling. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to havin’ me chest listened to, from years of check-ups. The more ye can find out, the better, I say. I'll just sit here, shall I? And let me know if there's anythin' ye want me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back and relax, that's perfect. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of a murmur. Not alarming, but something we'll need to investigate further. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 150 over 90. It can fluctuate, but we'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's take a look at your ankles. I do see a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Okay, that completes the quick exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Given your history and what I’ve found today, I’d like to order a few tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, tests sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m happy enough to have whatever ye think will help. I’m no' one to argue with a professional, and I trust your judgement. What sort of tests are ye thinkin’ of? And will they be painful? I'm a bit nervous, I must admit.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Benic, and I’ll explain everything clearly. I’m going to order a few things. First, an electrocardiogram, or ECG – that’s a quick, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Then, a complete blood count to check your overall health. And finally, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and blood sugar levels. We'll also do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. I'd also like to order a chest X-ray, just to get a better look at your lungs and heart size. And, given your family history and slightly enlarged heart, I think it would be wise to get an echocardiogram. That’s an ultrasound of your heart – it doesn’t involve any radiation and is completely painless. It gives us a very detailed picture of the heart's structure and function. The blood tests and chest X-ray are fairly straightforward. The echocardiogram will require a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – and will likely be scheduled separately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense, Doctor. A fair few tests, but I suppose that's what’s needed. ECG, blood work, chest X-ray… and an echo with the heart specialist. It all sounds a bit daunting, but I trust ye know what ye’re doin’. Will I need to fast for any of them? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a few appointments already booked, so I need to know if I need to make time for all this. And will I be able to drive myself to the specialist?
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Mr. Benic. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests, meaning no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. The ECG can be done at any time. The results for the blood tests and ECG should be back within a few days, usually three to five business days. The chest X-ray results typically take about 24 to 48 hours. The echocardiogram appointment will likely be scheduled within the next couple of weeks, and the cardiologist will discuss the results with you directly. As for driving to the specialist, it depends on the cardiologist's recommendations. If they plan to give you any medication that could make you drowsy, they will likely advise you to have someone drive you home. Otherwise, you should be fine to drive yourself. I will include that information in the referral. I’ll get the orders for these tests sent to the lab and arrange the referral to the cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds very good, Doctor. Fast from midnight, blood tests in a few days, chest X-ray…and echo with the specialist. No drivin’ if I'm on medication – I'll remember that. Thank ye for explainin’ everything so clearly, I feel a lot better now. It’s good to know what’s happenin’ and what to expect. I’ll just wait for the phone call to arrange the tests, then, is that right? And if I have any questions, I can just give the clinic a ring? I appreciate ye takin’ the time to listen to an old man’s worries. It's a comfort to know there are still good doctors about.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Benic. That’s exactly right, you’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule the blood tests and the radiology department to schedule the chest X-ray. And yes, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions at all – that’s what we’re here for. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and we'll talk soon.
