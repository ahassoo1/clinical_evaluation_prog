DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker, yes. Eight-one, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Eighty-one. Though I don’t see what my age has to do with… well, anything. It’s just… tired. Terribly tired, these past few weeks. It’s not like I’ve been doing anything to tire myself out, you know. Mostly just… being.
DOCTOR: "Being," right. And when did this… “being tired” start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… always with the dates. Let me think… it was after… Agnes’s birthday, I believe. Yes, Agnes turned ninety-two in June. So… July, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Things just… run together after a while.
DOCTOR: July. So, roughly a month. And is this tiredness… constant?
PATIENT: No, no, not constant. It comes and goes. Some days I feel… well, not good, exactly, but able to potter about. Other days… I just have to lie down. Like there’s no strength in me at all. It’s quite… undignified, really. A woman my age shouldn’t be feeling like this.
DOCTOR: "Undignified." Right. Any other symptoms accompanying this… fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. Well, my muscles feel a bit… achy sometimes. Not a sharp pain, just… dull. And I’ve been a bit clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a perfectly good teacup just yesterday. My husband, Harold, wasn’t pleased. Said I was being careless. He always says that.
DOCTOR: "Clumsiness." Okay. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, I don’t think so. Harold would have said something. He’s very particular about taking my temperature. Always has been. No chills, either. And night sweats… goodness, no. I always sleep quite warmly. A good flannel nightgown and a thick quilt. No, no sweats.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite hasn't been wonderful lately. Not that I've been eating much less, just... not as enthusiastic, you know? Harold makes a lovely roast on Sundays, and I barely touch it these days. As for weight… I wouldn't know. I haven't been on the scales in ages. Honestly, scales are just depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Harold handles all that, mostly. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And something for my arthritis, a yellow one. Oh, and a vitamin D, he says I don't get enough sun. That's a small one. I just take them with my breakfast. I wouldn't want to forget, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure, arthritis, vitamin D. Do you know the names of these medications, Mrs. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. Names? Harold keeps a list. He's very organized, that man. I just take the pills he gives me. I wouldn't want to mix them up, would I? That would be a disaster. Honestly, all these names… it’s all too much for an old woman to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just move on. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for fancy foods, you see. Stick to simple things. Plain tea, toast, a bit of fish on Fridays. Never any trouble with anything. Though… I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, after touching some lilies. But that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. Not a proper allergy, I wouldn't say.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I can, but it’s not the easiest thing these days. My knees, you see. They’re not what they used to be. Harold says I walk like an old penguin. There we go… slow but steady.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72, regular. Auscultation of lungs is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are diminished. Overall, physical exam is… unremarkable.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, is it? Well, I should certainly hope so. I try to keep myself presentable. Though I suppose 'unremarkable' doesn't explain why I'm feeling like I've aged another ten years overnight. Is that all you’re going to do? Just poke and prod?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Oitker, with all due respect, you're an 81-year-old female presenting with fatigue. Fatigue is… common. It could be a lot of things. We can run some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel – to rule out anything serious. But honestly, it's probably just… age. I’ll order the tests. Come back in a week.
PATIENT: “Just age”? Is that all it is? That's hardly a diagnosis, is it? Harold always said I was a bit of a worrier, but I do feel something is amiss. Very well. Blood tests, then. But I expect a proper explanation, mind you. Not just a shrug and “it’s age.”
DOCTOR: Alright. Take this to the lab downstairs. They’ll draw some blood. The results will be sent to me, and we’ll go from there. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Well! I never… A proper doctor would at least explain what they’re looking for. Honestly, the youth of today… Very well. I’ll go get these tests done. But don’t think for a moment I’m satisfied with this. .
