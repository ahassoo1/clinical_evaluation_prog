DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been…forgetting things. Little things at first, you know? But it's been happening more and more lately, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're bringing it up – it’s much better to address these things. “Forgetting things” can mean a lot of different things, so let's try to get a clearer picture. Could you give me some examples of these “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Let me think. Just yesterday, I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for! I stood there for a good five minutes trying to remember. And last week, I had a dentist appointment… not here, another dentist… and I just…missed it. Completely slipped my mind. It’s not like me at all. I always used to be so organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Missing an appointment and forgetting a shopping list… those are definitely changes from your usual behavior. And it sounds like it's causing you some stress, which is understandable. Do you find you’re having trouble remembering things that happened recently, or is it more about things you need to do?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think…both, actually. Like, I’ll talk to someone and then five minutes later not remember what we talked about. But it's also the needing-to-do things, definitely. I’ll make a mental note, and then poof, gone. It’s really frustrating. Is that…normal? I mean, at my age?
DOCTOR: It can be normal, Ms. Heidenthal. Memory changes do happen as we age, but a significant change, like you're describing, warrants investigation. Let’s go through some things to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. First, have you had any major illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Ask away. Hmm… let me think. I had a pretty bad bout of the flu a few years back, and broke my wrist when I was skiing, maybe ten years ago? Nothing major, really. No serious illnesses, no surgeries. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Flu, broken wrist, and appendectomy... good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather, on my father's side, had…Alzheimer's, I think it was. It was a long time ago, and my dad never really talked about it much. And my aunt had diabetes. Is that helpful? It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. A family history of Alzheimer's, particularly, is important to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just a multivitamin, usually. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I have one. That’s about it. I’m not really one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. Does that count? I mean, the ibuprofen isn't regular. Only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I'm German, we eat a lot of everything! Nothing comes to mind, anyway. I don’t really have sensitivities or anything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never really been interested in any of that. I drink coffee, maybe one or two cups a day. And I used to smoke when I was younger, but I quit about fifteen years ago. That’s it. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Not boring at all. That’s very good information. Now, tell me a little bit about your daily routine. What do you do with your time?
PATIENT: Well, I'm a dentist, as you know. So, most of my day is spent at work, seeing patients. It can be stressful, honestly. When I’m not working, I like to garden, mostly. I have a small vegetable garden. And I walk my dog, a little terrier named Fritz. I don’t get out much, to be honest. I live a pretty quiet life. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Stressful job, gardening, walking the dog… very good. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment – just some simple memory and balance tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I do get nervous at the doctor's office, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll take it slow and easy. It’s just routine. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go. Try not to poke me too hard!
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head, just your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. There… is that right? I'm trying not to blink too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. You're doing very well. Now, could you please tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Ebony Heidenthal. And today is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I had to think for a moment about the date, to be honest. I usually remember things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I'll say them, and you repeat them back. Then, I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Got it. Those are… easy enough. Hopefully, I won't forget those!
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had… toast. And coffee. Just toast and coffee, I think. It was a quick breakfast, I was running a little late for work. I don’t usually remember exactly what I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. There. Is that alright? I don't usually have trouble walking, but… I feel a bit awkward with you watching.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. Your walk looks normal, although a little cautious, which is understandable. Thank you. You can sit down now. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, that's all for the physical exam. Now, let's talk about what all of this means. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some memory changes that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that mean? Is it…serious? I was hoping it was just stress, you know? From work and everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're asking. It doesn't necessarily mean it is serious, but we need to rule out potential causes. Memory changes can be caused by many things, including stress, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and, less commonly, early signs of cognitive impairment. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a cognitive screening test, a simple questionnaire that can help us assess your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and a questionnaire, okay. Will the blood tests be painful? I’m not a fan of needles. And what kind of questions are on the questionnaire? Will it be… embarrassing?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will be a routine draw, just a small amount of blood taken from your arm. There's a little pinch, but it’s usually very quick and not too painful. The phlebotomist is very good. As for the questionnaire, it's not embarrassing at all. It's a series of simple questions about your memory, your ability to think, and your daily activities. It’s not a pop quiz, and there are no right or wrong answers. It just helps us get a better understanding of your cognitive function. We can do it right here in the office; it shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. Would you like to go ahead and do that now?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Fifteen minutes… I guess I can handle that. Yes, let’s do it. Get it over with, you know? What do I need to do? Just answer the questions? Is there anything special I should keep in mind?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just answer the questions as honestly as possible. There are some questions about your ability to manage everyday tasks, so think about how you've been doing things recently. Read each question carefully and choose the answer that best reflects your experience. I’ll be right here if you have any questions, but try to complete it on your own as much as possible. And don’t worry about getting every answer perfect. We're just gathering information. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Here goes nothing.
