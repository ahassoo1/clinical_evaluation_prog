DOCTOR: Right. Deloris Wrye. 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's about this… letter. For a pet, you see. A little dog. They need a letter from a doctor, apparently. Something about… being allowed to have one where I live now. Honestly, all this paperwork. It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? I can’t even remember why they need a letter, just that they do.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet. Right. And this is related to your housing situation, I presume?
PATIENT: Housing… yes, that's it! New place. It’s one of those… fancy apartments. They have rules for everything. Honestly, I don't recall the specifics. It’s a small dog, though. Very well-behaved. I used to have a cat, but… well, that’s another story. Don’t ask. It was ages ago.
DOCTOR: So, you require a letter stating you are medically capable of caring for a dog, as a condition of your lease. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, is that what it is? Medically capable… yes, that sounds right. They make you jump through hoops for everything these days! I keep all my check-ups, you know. Regular as clockwork. Though, I can't recall when the last one was… Dr. Adebayo, I think his name was. Before I moved, of course. This is all so… tiring.
DOCTOR: Right. And just to be clear, this letter isn't regarding any specific medical need the dog has, but your own ability to care for it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! The dog is perfectly fine. A little fluffball, really. This is about me. Showing them I'm… you know… capable. I'm a perfectly healthy woman! I walk, I shop, I… I do things. Honestly, I don’t understand why they need a doctor's note at all. It's all a bit silly, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, for documentation purposes, let's just run through a quick review of systems. Just to confirm everything is as you say. It'll be faster if we just get it over with. Have you experienced any significant changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my health…? Oh dear. That's… a broad question, isn’t it? Let me think. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone does, don’t they? And my knees… well, they aren't what they used to be. But that's just age, I suppose. Nothing major. I haven’t been sick, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal… what now? Oh, you mean like, my heart? No, no. Nothing like that. My heart's fine. I still get right up and dance when I want to! Though, it's been a while, to be honest. It’s just that… things aren't as energetic as they used to be. But no pain, dear. Definitely no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any dizziness, fainting spells, or headaches?
PATIENT: Dizzy… no, not really. Maybe if I stand up too fast sometimes, but everyone gets a little lightheaded. And headaches? Well, sometimes. A little tension headache, if I'm stressed. But nothing a little lie-down can’t fix. Honestly, I’m a very… resilient woman. I don’t go to the doctor unless something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: And you said you walk and shop…how much walking are we talking about, typically?
PATIENT: Oh, you know…around. To the shops. Not miles and miles! I walk to the little grocery store down the road, maybe a couple of times a week. And I like to stroll through the market on Saturdays, if the weather’s nice. It's not like I’m training for a marathon or anything. It’s just… normal walking. Everyday stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you've told me, and without a recent medical history to review, I can write a letter stating you appear to be in generally stable health and capable of caring for a small dog. However, I do recommend establishing care with a primary care physician in your area for regular check-ups. It’s important to have someone monitor your health proactively.
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, dear! Thank goodness. A letter is all I need, really. And a doctor…yes, you're right, I probably should. It's just… finding a good one. They're always so busy. But, yes, I'll look into it. Thank you so much! You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It’s a fairly generic statement, as I don't have your medical records. I've included a recommendation for establishing primary care. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Wonderful. No, no, I think that’s all. Just this letter. Thank you again, dear. You’ve saved me a lot of trouble. Honestly, paperwork…it’s the bane of my existence. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: You as well. .
