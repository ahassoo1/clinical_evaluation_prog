DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Doctor… Delacour, you say? Yes, yes. They told me to come. Something about… the mine. They want me checked, even though I feel alright. Been working there a long time, you know. A long time. They just… want to be sure. Waste of time, if you ask me. But the insurance… they insisted.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like this is a routine checkup requested by your employer, perhaps related to your work at the mine, as a precaution. Even if you’re feeling alright, it's always wise to be thorough. Just to clarify, when you say you’ve been working at the mine a long time, could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Hmph. Let me see… I started when I was a young man. Twenty years old, maybe? Almost sixty years, now. Sixty years digging in that hole! Before all this fancy equipment, too. Just pickaxes and shovels. Strong back then, I was. Nowadays… well. Still going, though! They wouldn’t keep me if I wasn’t useful.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… that is a remarkable length of service, Mr. Bigger. Thank you for clarifying. And it’s good to hear you are still finding ways to be useful. To get a better understanding of your current health status, and to ensure there are no lingering effects from your work, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. Doctors always askin’ about that. No, nothing serious. Had a bad cough once, a long time ago. And my back, of course. What do you expect after sixty years of digging? Other than that… I’ve been lucky. Strong constitution, I think. My wife… she used to get sick all the time. But me? I just keep going. Never been one for complainin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve generally been quite healthy. The cough and back pain are helpful to know. And you're right, a strong constitution is a great thing to have. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had need for cuttin’ and stitchin’. Hospital? Only once. When my wife… well, when she passed. They kept me overnight, just to… to make sure I was alright. But I was fine. Shock, they said. But I was fine. Never been a sickly man, I tell you. Waste of good money, all this doctorin’.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like a difficult time. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Not much left. My wife, God rest her soul, is gone, like I said. Had one son, years ago. Don’t see him much anymore. Lives in the city. Too busy with his… his work, he says. Got a few grandchildren, but they’re… distant. We don’t keep close. It’s just me now, mostly. Quiet life.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Bigger. Family can be a great source of support, and it sounds like things are a bit quiet for you now. Now, let's talk a little bit about your daily habits. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched the stuff. My wife hated it. Said it smelled awful, and was bad for your health. Always was a sensible woman, my wife. I used to see the other miners smokin’, coughin’ up a lung, but me? No. Never had the urge. Kept my lungs clear for diggin’.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bigger. That’s a very healthy habit to maintain. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little, sometimes. A small glass of beer with my supper, now and then. Nothing fancy. Just to… relax. But I don’t go drinkin’ every night. Never been one for gettin’ rowdy. A little bit, to help me sleep, that's all. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: I see. Just a small glass of beer to help you sleep. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never needed any, thankfully. Used to take a little somethin' for my back, years ago, when it first started botherin’ me. But it didn’t do much good, so I stopped. Now I just… I just deal with it. Rub it with liniment sometimes. That’s about it. Don't believe in fillin' my body with all those chemicals.
DOCTOR: I understand. You prefer to avoid medications if possible. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. Never been stung by a bee, never had a bad reaction to any food… Nothing. My wife was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… always sneezin’ and wheezin’. Me? Tough as nails, I was. Never bothered me none.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Bigger. Alright. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general assessment of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. More pokin’ and proddin’. Fine, whatever. Get it over with. But don’t go spendin’ too much time, I’ve got things to do. And be gentle, mind you. Back’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just take a few moments to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Another deep breath… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although slightly diminished. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 145/90. That’s a little elevated, but not critically high. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses noted. Reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally. Range of motion is limited in the lower back, as expected. Alright, Mr. Bigger. That concludes the physical examination. Everything appears generally normal, with the expected limitations in your lower back. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? Humph. Probably just from all the stress. Worryin' about things, you know. Always somethin' to worry about. Well, as long as it's nothin' serious. Don’t go givin’ me any fancy pills, though. I told you, I don’t believe in all that. Just tell me if there’s somethin' I need to be worried about. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger. We can certainly discuss ways to manage your blood pressure without immediately resorting to medication. Lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, can often make a significant difference. Given your age and work history, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a few basic blood tests to get a more complete picture of your overall health. These tests will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests, eh? More pokin' and proddin'. Sigh. Fine, whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… don't take too much blood. I’m a bit… sensitive, you know. And tell me how long it'll take to get the results. Don’t want to be comin’ back here every other day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. We'll only take a small sample. And I assure you, it’s a quick procedure. The results typically take about 5-7 business days to come back. The lab technician will send them directly to my office. Once I have them, I'll review them carefully and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate a little more physical activity into your daily routine, if possible. Even a short walk each day can be beneficial. And I’ll give you a handout with some dietary recommendations for managing blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. Not really. You've poked and prodded enough for one day. Just… make sure them results come quickly. And don’t be givin’ me any fancy pills, remember? I’m an old man, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, and I don’t need no fancy medicines to ruin it. Just tell me straight, if there’s somethin’ wrong. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Bigger. I will be sure to review the results carefully and discuss them with you honestly and straightforwardly. We will work together to develop a plan that is best for you and respects your wishes. Here’s a lab requisition form. Please take this to the lab located at [address of lab]. They're open from [lab hours]. Thank you for your patience today. If you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger.
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be seein’ you… when them results come back. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
