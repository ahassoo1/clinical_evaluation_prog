DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It's this heat, really. Can't take it like I used to. Always been a strong man, worked outside my whole life, you know? Painting, building… but this summer’s different. Just… too much. Feel like I’m melting just walking to the mailbox. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the heat has been oppressive. It's good you're recognizing your limitations. “Can't take it like I used to…” can you elaborate on that, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What’s there to elaborate? I get hotter, quicker, that’s what. Used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now? An hour, maybe. And I’m sweating like a pig, even just thinking about going outside. And it’s not just the sweating, it's… I feel weak, dizzy sometimes. Like I’m going to faint. Not a good feeling for a man who's spent his life on a roof, let me tell you. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness and dizziness… and increased sweating, specifically related to the heat. And this is a new development?
PATIENT: New this year, definitely. Last few summers were hot, don't get me wrong, but I managed. I’d drink plenty of water, take breaks in the shade… it was normal precautions, you know? This year, none of that seems to be helping. I’m doing everything the same, maybe even more careful, but it's just...worse. I even tried those little cooling towels, like they sell for athletes. Useless, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No change in medications or diet?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been a fan of pills, if I can help it. Diet… well, I eat what I always eat. Rice and lentils mostly, some vegetables when they’re in season. Nothing fancy. I’m not one of those men who needs a special diet. Simple living, that's what I believe in. Keeps you strong. Or, used to, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now you’re asking me about my stomach? What does that have to do with the heat? I feel hot, I sweat a lot, and I get dizzy. That’s it. Look, I’m a practical man. I work with my hands, I don’t sit around worrying about… bowel habits. No, nothing like that. Perfectly normal, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any confusion, or changes in your mental state?
PATIENT: Confusion? What are you implying, doctor? I may be getting too hot to work comfortably, but I’m not senile. I know my name, I know where I am, and I remember perfectly well what I had for breakfast – rice and lentils, in case you were wondering. I’m perfectly clear-headed, thank you. I just want to know why I can’t handle the heat anymore. It’s not rocket science, is it?
DOCTOR: I’m simply being thorough, Mr. Coby. These symptoms can be indicative of a number of things, and it’s my job to rule them out. Now, have you been drinking enough fluids?
PATIENT: Of course I’m drinking enough fluids! I told you, I’m being careful. More careful than ever! Big glasses of water all day. I’m not an idiot. You’re starting to sound like my daughter. Always worrying, always telling me what to do. I’ve lived sixty-two years, I think I know how to stay hydrated. It's just… the heat is different this year. It's stronger. It’s… oppressive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your lungs and heart. Then, perhaps we can review your chart and consider some basic blood work. Just to be certain. If you’ll just step over here…
PATIENT: Blood work? Really? For a bit of heat? Seems a bit much, don't you think? I just want to know what’s happening, not have a whole battery of tests run on me. But… alright. If you insist. Don’t expect anything exciting, though. I’m a simple man, doctor. Very simple.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table, Mr. Coby. I'll start with your blood pressure. 160 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breath sounds are clear, but a slight murmur. Not new, likely. Pulse is 88, a bit weak. And your skin feels warm and dry… rather than sweaty, as you described.
PATIENT: Warm and dry? Well, I told you I was trying to stay cool! It’s… it’s a losing battle. The sweat dries before it even hits the ground. Everything’s just… off this year. A murmur, you say? Never had any trouble with my heart before. I used to hike up those mountains, no problem at all. This is all very unsettling, doctor. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, given your age, elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the new onset of weakness and dizziness with heat exposure… it's important to rule out some potential underlying causes. We need to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. I’m also going to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. It's likely nothing serious, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now.
PATIENT: Blood… more blood? Look, are you sure this is all necessary? I just feel a bit hot, that's all! And now I’m going to be poked and prodded and have all sorts of tests run on me? I’m telling you, doctor, it’s the heat. It’s just… stronger this year. I don’t understand why you’re making such a fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration. However, I have a professional obligation to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. Ignoring them could have serious consequences. It’s my job to ensure your safety, and that requires a proper workup. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Please try to relax. And frankly, attributing everything to “the heat” is rarely a productive approach to medical care.
PATIENT: Productive? You think I enjoy feeling weak and dizzy? I've worked this land my whole life! I know my body, and something is different this year. You treat me like some hypochondriac! Fine. Do your tests. Draw your blood. But don’t come back to me with a bunch of fancy medical jargon if it turns out to be nothing more than a particularly hot summer. I’m a simple man, remember? Just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly, Mr. Coby. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, I advise you to limit your outdoor activity and stay well-hydrated. We’ll discuss the findings once I have them. I’ll also have the nurse print out a list of heat exhaustion symptoms for your reference. .
