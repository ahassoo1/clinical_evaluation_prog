DOCTOR: Hello Deloris, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… pet. Yes, a pet ownership letter, that’s right. I need one of those. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit silly, isn’t it? You need permission to have a dog these days…
DOCTOR: A pet ownership letter… right. I see. Some landlords or housing associations require those, yes. It confirms you’re a responsible pet owner. It can be a bit of paperwork, you’re right. Before we get started, just so I have everything correct… is this for a new pet, or one you’ve had for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a while now. Ages, really. A very long time. I… honestly, I can’t quite put my finger on exactly how long. It’s a dog, a lovely thing. A big one. Brown, I think. Or maybe black? It’s… it’s been a bit of a blur, all these years. Does it matter how long?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't absolutely matter, but it’s helpful to have a general idea for the letter. Just trying to get a clear picture. So, a larger dog, brown or black… do you remember approximately when you got him?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, doctor, you’re making me think too hard. It was… after the divorce, definitely. Yes, after. A little pick-me-up, you know? A companion. That was… oh, goodness, was it ten years ago? Maybe more? I really don’t keep track of dates. Everything just… blends together.
DOCTOR: That's alright. After the divorce… so, approximately ten years ago or more. That gives us a starting point. And what breed is he, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, breed. Honestly, I never bothered with all that fancy breed stuff. He’s just… a dog. A good dog. Big and… fluffy. People always ask, you know? “What breed is he?” And I just… shrug. He looks like a… a big, brown dog. Maybe a bit of… Shepherd in him? I don’t know. Truly, I haven’t a clue. I just wanted a companion, not a pedigree certificate.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. He sounds lovely, regardless of breed. So, a large, brown, fluffy dog, possibly with some Shepherd in him. Now, this letter typically requires a statement confirming he's up-to-date on his vaccinations and doesn't pose a risk to others. Do you have his vaccination records with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, records… I think I had them somewhere… but honestly, doctor, it’s all a bit chaotic. I’m terrible with paperwork. I usually just take him to the vet and let them handle all that. I wouldn't know where to begin looking for records. I’m sure they’re fine though. He's a good boy, never any trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can likely get those records directly from your veterinarian's office with your permission. Do you happen to remember the name and location of the vet's office?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s… Dr. Evans? Yes, Dr. Evans. He’s… somewhere near the mall, I think? A little strip mall, with a bakery next door. Honestly, everything looks the same these days. It’s… the one with the blue sign? Or maybe it’s green? I'm terribly bad with directions, and remembering names, you see. It’s just… a vet. Near the mall. I'm sure if you look up vets near the mall, you’ll find him.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see… Dr. Evans… yes, here we are – Evans Animal Clinic, on Oak Street. That sounds right. With your permission, I’ll go ahead and contact them to request his vaccination records. While I do that, can you tell me a little bit about his general health?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, thank you, dear. You’re a lifesaver. Honestly, I don't know what I’d do without you. His health… well, he’s getting a bit old, I suppose. A bit slow, you know? And he snores. Loudly. But otherwise, he’s fine. He eats his food, he goes for walks… he sleeps a lot. He had a little cough last winter, but it cleared up on its own. Nothing major, really. He's a resilient boy, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit older, slower, snores, cough last winter that resolved. That's good to know. Has he had any recent changes in appetite or water consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Now, that’s a good question. Honestly, doctor, I mostly just put the food down and he eats it. Or doesn’t. I don’t really pay that much attention, if I’m being truthful. He seems to be drinking water… yes, I think so. Maybe a little more lately? Or maybe not. It's hard to say. I really don't monitor those things. He’s a dog, you know? They drink water. They eat food.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible slight increase in water consumption. And has he had any issues with mobility - difficulty getting up, walking, or showing any signs of pain when he moves?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… well, he’s a bit creaky sometimes, you know? Like an old house. Especially when he first gets up in the morning. He’s a bit slow to get going, that’s for sure. And he doesn’t jump around like he used to. But he manages. He still enjoys his walks, even if they’re a little slower paced. He’s just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, creaky joints, slower pace, some difficulty getting up. That's helpful. Just one more question. Has he had any recent changes in behavior?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Behavior… No, not really. He sleeps. He eats. He goes for walks. He barks at the mailman, like always. He’s a pretty consistent dog, really. No sudden changes, no… I don't know, unusual outbursts or anything like that. He's just a good boy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Deloris. It sounds like he's a lovely, consistent companion, and just showing some expected signs of aging. I’ve contacted Evans Animal Clinic to request his records. Once they send those over, I can complete the pet ownership letter confirming he's up-to-date on his vaccinations and doesn't pose a risk. That should be all we need. Would you like a copy of the letter emailed to you once it’s completed?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, dear. Email is perfect. Please do. Honestly, you’ve taken a huge weight off my shoulders. It's all so silly, isn't it? Having to prove you own your own dog… But thank you. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Deloris. It's no problem at all. I'm glad I could help. I'll make a note to email it to you as soon as I receive the records from Dr. Evans. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Truly. You’ve been a lifesaver. I appreciate your patience, and for not making me feel like a complete idiot for not remembering things. It’s just… a lot goes on, you know?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Deloris. It’s perfectly understandable. We all have a lot going on. Just take care, and enjoy your time with your companion. I’ll be in touch with the letter as soon as I receive the records. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: You too, dear. You have a lovely day as well. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Goodbye, Deloris! .
