DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea I’ve been gettin’ most mornings now. It's a bit of a bother, really. Especially seein’ as how I’ve got this heart trouble, you know? Makes me worry it's somethin’ more than just a wee bit of morning sickness, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your heart condition. Nausea can certainly be unsettling. To clarify, you mentioned “most mornings.” How long has this been going on, and would you describe it as constant throughout the morning, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm, let's see… it started, oh, about three weeks ago now, I’d say. Not constant, no. It usually hits me within an hour of gettin’ up, and then it fades after a couple of hours. Some mornings it's just a bit of queasiness, others… well, others I've actually been sick, you know? Not every day, mind you, but enough to make me a bit uneasy. It's worse if I don't eat somethin' right away, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, intermittent, worse on an empty stomach, and you have experienced actual vomiting on some occasions. And can you describe the vomiting?
PATIENT: Aye, I can. It's… well, it's not forceful, if that makes sense. More like… bringin’ it up gently, if you will. It’s usually just whatever I had for breakfast, though. No blood or anything like that. And it’s not like a proper stomach bug, there's no… other end trouble, if you know what I mean. Just the nausea and the occasional bit of sickness. I've also been a wee bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to… well, just gettin' older, mostly.
DOCTOR: No blood in the vomitus, no diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and increased fatigue. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your heart trouble. Could you tell me what was diagnosed and when?
PATIENT: Right, the heart. They told me it’s… congestive heart failure, I think that’s what they called it. About five years ago now, I was diagnosed. The doctor put me on some tablets, water pills mostly, to get rid of the fluid. I’ve been takin’ them regular as clockwork since then. I get a bit breathless now and then, especially if I climb stairs, but I manage. It's usually alright if I take my time. They said it’s gettin’ worse slowly, you know? It’s just… this nausea feels different than usual, that’s what’s worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure diagnosed five years ago, managed with diuretics, with some shortness of breath on exertion. And you’re right to be concerned if this nausea feels different. Given your history, it’s good you came in. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go ahead with your questions, then the exam. I'm happy to answer what I can. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It's a bit unsettling bein' sick when you’ve got this heart trouble hangin' over you.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Alright. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently, aside from the nausea making you feel less hungry?
PATIENT: No, not really. When I am hungry, I eat normally. I enjoy my food, still. It's not like I've lost my taste for things or anything. It's just… gettin' it to stay down is the problem, mostly. I've maybe been eatin’ a bit smaller portions, mind you, just in case, but I haven't been avoidin' anything in particular. I like a good porridge in the mornin', usually, and a bit of toast with marmalade. That sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Porridge and toast – good. No specific food aversions. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Aye, actually. Now that you mention it, my ankles have been a bit puffy the last week or so. I just put it down to the weather, you know? Been a bit warm, and I tend to swell up a bit in the heat. But it’s a wee bit worse than usual, I think. I’ve been tryin’ to put my feet up more, but it doesn’t seem to be makin’ much difference. It’s on both sides, mind you, not just one.
DOCTOR: Puffy ankles on both sides, and not improving with elevation. That’s important information. Now, finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the water pills, or have you started anything new recently - even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... just the water pills, that’s all. Furosemide, I think they’re called. No, I haven’t started anything new. I'm a bit cautious with tablets, you know? I don't like takin’ too much of anything if I can avoid it. I might take a bit of paracetamol now and then for a headache, but that's it. Nothing regular, mind you. Just when I really need it. And I haven't been takin' anything for a headache lately either. So, just the water pills, Doctor. Been on them for five years, same dosage the whole time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for that detailed information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then I'll check your ankles again. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m happy to cooperate. I trust your judgement, you know? Just want to get to the bottom of this, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90, and your pulse is regular but slightly fast at 88. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight murmur on auscultation – that’s consistent with your known heart condition. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. And your ankles do exhibit 2+ pitting edema bilaterally – meaning there’s noticeable swelling that leaves an indent when I press on them. Given your history of congestive heart failure and these findings, along with the nausea and fatigue, I suspect this could be a sign of worsening heart failure. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a BNP level. The BNP will help us assess how much your heart is stressed. Would you be able to go to the lab today?
PATIENT: Aye, I can get to the lab today, no problem. 2+ what-now? The… pittin’ thingy? Right. Sounds a bit worryin’, that, but I trust you know what you’re doin’, Doctor. The blood work… aye, sounds sensible. The more information, the better, I suppose. So, go to the lab, get the bloods done… and then what? Will I hear back from you soon? And is this somethin’ serious? I’m a bit concerned, you can probably tell. Just bein’ honest. I don’t want to end up in the hospital, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Benic. It’s good you’re being honest. The "pitting" refers to the indent left when I press on your swollen ankles – it's a sign of fluid buildup. As for seriousness, it could indicate worsening heart failure, which needs to be addressed, but we don’t know for sure yet. That’s why the blood work is important. We need to see what your BNP level is, as well as checking your kidney function and electrolytes. I’ll get the lab order sent over electronically, and they should be able to take the bloods right away. Once the results are back – usually within a few hours – my nurse will call you to let you know. I'll also review them myself and call you directly to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant weight gain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Right. New or worsenin’ breathlessness, chest pain, weight gain… I’ll remember that. Aye, that's good to know. I think… no, I think that covers most of it, Doctor. Just the blood work, wait for the phone call, and look out for those symptoms. I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. It’s a bit of a relief to have a plan, if you catch my drift. I’m a worrier, you see. Always have been. But thank you. Truly. I think… I think I’ll just go and get those bloods done, then. And hopefully, it’s not too serious. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. It’s my job to help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. And remember, we're taking things one step at a time. I'll be in touch soon. Take care, and please don’t stress too much.
