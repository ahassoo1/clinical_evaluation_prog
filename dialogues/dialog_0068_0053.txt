DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… my waterworks, you could say. I'm having a bit of trouble, getting things going when I need to. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a couple of weeks now, I’d say. Not a sudden thing, just slowly getting harder.
DOCTOR: Alright, trouble with urination… a gradual onset over a couple of weeks. Can you describe what you mean by "harder"?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a while to start, you see? I have to… push, a little. And sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out at once, like there’s still some left in there. It's not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. And I find myself going more often, especially at night. That's the worst part, getting up so many times.
DOCTOR: So, hesitancy – difficulty starting the stream – and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Increased frequency, particularly nocturia… getting up at night. No pain, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in the strength of the stream itself, or any dribbling afterwards?
PATIENT: Hmm… the strength… it’s not as strong as it used to be, I suppose. Not a powerful stream, if you know what I mean. And yes, there is some dribbling afterwards, a little bit. Nothing major, but enough to… bother me, you know? I have to be careful with my clothes. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No blood, definitely not. And no, no pain in my belly. Like I said, it’s not painful, just… inconvenient. It’s just this whole business with the waterworks, you see? It’s getting to be a bit of a worry. I don't like being up and down all night.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s go over some other things, just to get a clearer picture. Do you have any history of medical problems – anything at all that you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago. And I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Doctor Januškevicius, he’s a good man, keeps me on top of things. Other than that… not much, really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn't have that at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, hypertension controlled with medication, and some arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, every morning for the blood pressure. And sometimes I take Ibuprofen for my knees, when they're really acting up. Just over-the-counter, nothing special. That's it, I think. I'm pretty good about remembering my pills, you know? Doctor Januškevicius always makes sure I understand everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily, Ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. I can eat anything, take any medicine... never had a problem. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I've never had to worry about that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, have there been any recent changes in your life, like increased stress, changes in your fluid intake, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my grandson moved away for university last month. That was a bit sad, I miss him terribly. But other than that… no, not really. I drink about the same amount of tea as always, maybe a little more when I'm feeling down. And I haven't been any more stressed than usual. It’s just… life, you know? It keeps going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check a few things. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief external exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of unpleasantness, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. It shouldn't be unpleasant at all. Just routine. Alright, I’m listening to your abdomen now… sounds are normal. And just a quick external exam… no tenderness to palpation. I’m going to check your prostate now. Hmm… the prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not markedly. There is no acute tenderness. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s a common condition in men as they get older, where the prostate enlarges and can cause these urinary symptoms. It’s not cancer, but it can be bothersome. We should do a couple of tests to confirm this. I want to check a PSA level, which is a blood test that can help rule out other issues. And I’d like to do a urinalysis to make sure there’s no infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Prostatic… what was that now? Sounds… serious. It’s not cancer, you say? That’s good, that’s very good. But an enlarged… prostate? Is that why I’m having trouble? And tests… yes, tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A PSA… and a… urinalysis? I can do that. I just… I hope it's not too bad. I don't like being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. But if it will help, then yes, let’s do the tests. Is it painful, these tests?
DOCTOR: It's not serious, Ms. Yadao. It's very common as men age, like getting wrinkles! The prostate is a gland that helps with urination, and it tends to grow larger with age. That growth can press on the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the body – causing the symptoms you’re experiencing. The PSA test is just a blood draw, like the ones you get when you have your cholesterol checked. The urinalysis is just a sample of your urine. Neither one is painful. We’ll send the blood sample to the lab, and you can give a urine sample right here in the clinic. It's a very simple process. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. There are several options available, from lifestyle changes to medication and, in some cases, procedures. We'll go over everything in detail and decide what’s right for you. Would you like me to have a nurse draw your blood and collect a urine sample now?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s… a relief, somewhat. Like wrinkles! I like that analogy. So, it’s not anything terrible. And just blood and… water? Yes, that sounds alright. A nurse can do that, yes. I’m not good with needles myself, so I’ll let a professional handle it. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it is just an enlarged… prostate. Lead the way, I suppose. Just try to be quick, if you could. I don’t like lingering in medical places.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. She’s very gentle. It won’t take long at all. Nurse Petrov, could you please come to examination room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It's just… one gets a bit anxious, you know? Being poked and prodded and talked about in medical terms. It’s not a pleasant experience, even if it is just wrinkles. But you seem very kind, and I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Yadao. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. And I assure you, everything will be explained clearly, in plain language, every step of the way. Let’s just wait for the nurse, and we’ll get this taken care of quickly. Is there anything I can get for you while we wait?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I'm alright, just a bit of waiting will do. Perhaps a glass of water, if you have some? It's been a bit dry in here, talking so much. But other than that, I'm fine. Just waiting, and hoping for the best, I suppose. This whole… prostate business is a bit unsettling, you know? But you seem very competent, so I trust you to get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Nurse Petrov, would you mind bringing a glass of water to examination room three as well, please?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're very thoughtful. It’s a nice room, actually. Not as sterile as I expected. Reminds me a bit of my grandson’s university library, strangely enough. He’s studying to be a lawyer, you know? A very bright boy. But I digress. I suppose I should try to relax and think of… pleasant things. But it's hard when one is worried about an enlarged prostate.
DOCTOR: Nurse Petrov: Here you are, Ms. Yadao. Doctor Sham, everything is ready when you are. Thank you, Nurse Petrov. Alright, Ms. Yadao. We’ll just wait a few minutes for the nurse to collect your sample. She’ll explain everything. Then we’ll have the results back in a couple of days. Do you have any questions for me before she gets here?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Nurse Petrov. That’s very kind. Well… yes, actually, I do have a question. If it is just this enlarged prostate, will I… lose control of my waterworks? That’s what I’m most afraid of, I think. Having to… you know. That would be… very embarrassing. Is that a possibility? And is there anything I can do to prevent that? That’s my biggest worry, Doctor. Honestly. It's not the pain, it's the… loss of dignity, you understand?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid concern, Ms. Yadao, and a very common one. Fortunately, losing complete control of your bladder is not typically a symptom of BPH, and it’s relatively uncommon even with more advanced cases. However, you can experience urgency – a sudden, strong need to urinate – and frequency, which can be disruptive and understandably embarrassing. There are many treatments available to manage those symptoms. We can start with lifestyle changes – things like limiting fluids before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises. Medication can also help to relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate and reducing urgency. In some cases, procedures can be done to open up the urethra. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the test results, and we’ll choose the best course of treatment for you. I want to reassure you that we'll do everything we can to manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Does that help ease your mind a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you, Doctor. Knowing that there are… options, and that I won't necessarily end up… losing control, is a relief. Pelvic floor exercises… I think I’ve heard of those. And medication… I suppose I can try that. I’m not fond of taking pills, but if it will help, then I’ll do it. It’s just… I’ve always been very independent, you see? And the thought of relying on medication, or… procedures, is a bit unsettling. But you seem very competent, and I trust your judgment. So, the nurse will be here shortly to collect a… sample? I suppose I should prepare myself. It's not a pleasant thought, but I'll do it if it will help. Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. And you’re right to want to maintain your independence. We’ll start with the least invasive options first, and we’ll only consider more aggressive treatments if necessary. Yes, the nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample. It’s a quick process, and she’ll explain everything. Then we’ll just wait for the results, which should be back in a couple of days. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, difficulty urinating, or blood in your urine, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've answered everything I was worried about, and explained everything so clearly. I feel much better now, thank you. Just… a bit anxious about the sample, but I'll manage. I suppose I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. You've been very kind and patient. It's reassuring to have a doctor who takes the time to explain things, and who doesn't talk down to me. I'm ready when she is.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. That’s what I’m here for. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions at any time. Nurse Petrov, could you please come to examination room three when you have a moment?
