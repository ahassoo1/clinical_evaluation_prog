DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, mostly. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening quite a bit lately. And… I keep getting water infections, you see. The doctor told me a while back it has something to do with my kidneys. Polycystic, he called it.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay. Polycystic kidney disease, right. I recall that name popping up in some records… though things get a bit fuzzy sometimes, you understand. So, this pain in your side… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Polycystic… it’s a mouthful, isn’t it? Well, it’s… hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. And it’s usually on my left side, I think. Sometimes it goes around to my back a little. It comes on and off, like I said, but when it is there, it’s… bothersome. Not crippling, but certainly not pleasant. I've been trying to keep track of when it happens, but… well, I'm not always the best at remembering those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a mouthful! And it's perfectly alright if remembering details is tricky. We can work through it. A dull ache on your left side, radiating to your back… and it comes and goes. Does anything seem to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I eat, or any particular activity. Sometimes it just… is there. Though, now that you mention it… maybe it's worse after I've been sitting for a long time? I do spend a lot of time in my chair, watching the television, you see. But I can’t say for sure. It's just a feeling, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so potentially worse after prolonged sitting. We'll make a note of that. And you mentioned the water infections – how often are you experiencing those, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It varies. Let me think… I’d say maybe… every couple of months, on average? Sometimes it’s three months, sometimes a little less. It’s been happening for… well, a long time now. I go to the doctor, they give me something to clear it up, and then it’s usually alright for a while. But it always comes back, you see. It's getting a bit tiresome, to be honest. I worry about it constantly.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Espinueva. Recurring infections are tiring, and understandably concerning. Now, when you say “something to clear it up,” do you recall what medication you’ve been prescribed for those infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I take a lot of different pills, you see. For my blood pressure, and a little something for my joints… and then the one for the water infections. It’s a little white pill, I think. Or maybe a pale yellow? I really can’t recall the name. I just take what the doctor gives me, you understand. I don’t always pay attention to the names of things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Espinueva, it's perfectly common to have trouble remembering medication names. We can look through your records to see what you've been prescribed. Now, while I'm doing that, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I do feel a bit tired sometimes, more than usual, perhaps. And I’ve noticed I’m going to the toilet a bit more often than I used to, even when it’s not a water infection. Just… needing to go more frequently. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little bit breathless, especially if I try to do too much. But I put that down to my age, mostly. It’s probably just getting old, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased fatigue, more frequent urination, and occasional breathlessness… We’ll make note of all of that. Okay, it looks like you've been prescribed Nitrofurantoin for the urinary tract infections, and Amlodipine for your blood pressure. Your kidney function tests have been… fluctuating a bit over the past few years, which is not entirely unexpected with polycystic kidney disease. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your lungs and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Lung and abdomen, you say? Yes, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m not entirely sure what you’re looking for, but… if it helps, then please do. I'm a bit worried about my breathing, so checking the lungs sounds like a good idea. Just… please be gentle, if you would. My side is a little tender, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Espinueva, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the left side, but nothing immediately alarming. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm… there is some tenderness on your left flank, as you mentioned, but no guarding or rigidity. It's not an acutely painful area, but it’s certainly sensitive to the touch. Alright, everything seems… stable, but your tenderness and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s… that’s the spot. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable, certainly. Diminished breath sounds, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? What sort of investigation are you thinking of, Doctor? Is it something serious? I do worry about these things, you see. I don’t want to end up in hospital, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Espinueva, and I want to assure you we’re taking this seriously, but that doesn’t automatically mean it’s something dire. Diminished breath sounds can have several causes, and we need to determine the exact one. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease, the tenderness on your flank, and the recurring infections, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for infection. Second, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Third, a urinalysis to look for any signs of infection or blood in your urine. And finally, an imaging scan – either a CT scan or an ultrasound of your abdomen – to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out any blockages or complications. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood count… metabolic panel… urinalysis… and a scan. Yes, that sounds… thorough. A scan sounds a bit daunting, but if it’s necessary, then so be it. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. How long will I have to wait for the results? And will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? I don't like being kept in the dark, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your desire to not be kept in the dark, Mr. Espinueva, and I’ll do my best to keep you informed every step of the way. The lab results should be available within a day or two. The scan will likely take a bit longer to schedule – perhaps a week or so, depending on availability. For the scan, you’ll likely need to fast for a few hours beforehand, and we may ask you to drink plenty of water to help visualize your kidneys. The radiology department will give you specific instructions when they schedule your appointment. In the meantime, I want you to continue monitoring your symptoms. If you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, chills, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Fasting and drinking water… I can do that. Monitoring symptoms… yes, I'll try my best. Sudden pain, fever… I'll keep that in mind. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you. Should I make an appointment to come back and discuss the results, once they’re available? Or will you contact me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. I’ll go ahead and have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once we expect the results to be back. That way, we can discuss everything in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me. Thank you again for taking the time to listen. I feel a little bit better now, knowing that we’re getting things checked out. I’ll wait for my nurse to schedule the appointment. Have a good day, Doctor Renzi.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could ease some of your worries. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. You have a good day as well, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
