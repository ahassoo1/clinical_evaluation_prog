DOCTOR: Right, Arlan Segretto. 74… yes. Well, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always going. Not a lot each time, mind you, just… often. It’s a bother, mostly. My wife keeps saying I’m drinking too much tea, but I don’t see how. It’s just a habit, really.
DOCTOR: A habit… right. And how long has this “bother” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while. Maybe a few months? Longer? Honestly, time just… slips away these days. I wouldn’t be able to tell you exactly. It didn’t bother me much at first, just a little inconvenient. Now it's… more noticeable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Months, you say. And is it just more frequent, or has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well… no, I don't think so. It doesn't hurt when I go, and the… stream is normal, I guess. Just… more trips. It's mostly at night, that’s the worst part. Waking my wife up. She doesn’t like that one bit. She says I’m disturbing her beauty sleep!
DOCTOR: Right. And you said you drink a lot of tea?
PATIENT: Well, "a lot" is relative, isn't it? I have a few cups throughout the day. It's a good tea, you know. Ukrainian, of course. Best kind. But like I said, I don’t think that’s it. I’ve been drinking tea for seventy years, it’s never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Seventy years… and you’ve never noticed a change in your bathroom habits before?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, I wouldn’t put it quite like that. Things change as you get older, don't they? But this isn’t just “things changing.” This is… disruptive. And frankly, a little embarrassing to even talk about. I’m a practical man, I fix things. This isn’t something I can just… fix, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems… not that I’ve noticed. A little arthritis in my hands, but who doesn’t have that at my age? My wife keeps wanting me to see a specialist, but I tell her, “What good will poking and prodding do?” It’s just getting old, that’s all. And old people go to the bathroom more. It’s a fact of life.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you on any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. Let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a while back. A small white pill. Can’t remember the name of it now, never could keep track of those things. My wife handles all that, mostly. She’s very good with… details.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything, pretty much. Ukrainian food is very… robust, you know. Lots of garlic, onions, everything. Strong stuff. A man needs his strength!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to rule things out. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I’m not a fan of doctors poking around, but… alright. Just take it easy now, my joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nothing immediately concerning there. Now, let’s check your prostate. It’s a standard procedure, just to be thorough. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute! A… a what now? Look, I’m an old man, not a… not a science project. I don't like the sound of that at all. My wife always said I should get a second opinion... perhaps I should have. I don't see how that's going to help me go to the bathroom less.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get upset. It’s just a routine check. But given your age, and the frequency of your urination, we should investigate. Look, it could be nothing, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’m going to order a urine sample and a PSA test. The PSA test is a blood test that checks for prostate issues. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. A test, then. But I’m telling you, it’s just tea. And old age. I don’t need poking and prodding. My wife is going to be insufferable if she finds out I’m having blood work. Honestly, sometimes I think she wants me to be sick, just so she has something to fuss over.
DOCTOR: Here’s the requisition for the urine sample and blood work. The nurse will show you where to go. I want you to drink normal fluids, don't restrict anything. And please try not to get too agitated. We're just ruling things out. Now, I’ll need to see you back in a week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions…? No. I suppose not. Just… a week, you say? It feels like a long time to be worrying over… this. Very well. Just tell the nurse I’m here, and let’s get this over with. I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: The nurse is just down the hall. And yes, a garden is important. We'll get this sorted. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. I suppose. Poking and prodding… honestly. My wife is going to be thrilled…
