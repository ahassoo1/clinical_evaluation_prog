DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s been happening for… oh, I couldn’t say exactly how long. A while, I suppose. It's just... a lot.
DOCTOR: “A while” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Verbos. We need some degree of accuracy here. Has this been happening for weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks… yes, perhaps. Or maybe months. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s not a sudden change, you understand. It just… gradually became more noticeable. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, exactly. Just… inconvenient. And a little worrisome, naturally. I don't recall anything specific that started it, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Very well. And is there anything else accompanying this… frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t noticed any… discomfort, beyond the obvious. And no, I don’t believe I’m particularly thirsty, though I do enjoy a glass of water with my meals. I suppose I sleep through the night without issue. Nothing really… stands out, to be honest. It's mostly just… the trips to the restroom, Doctor. A lot of them.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those. No fever, no chills, certainly not vomiting. And I haven’t felt nauseous, no. Just… the frequent need to, well, you know. Is that unusual? I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to pinpoint things.
DOCTOR: It is difficult to provide a proper assessment when the information is… imprecise, Mr. Verbos. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I believe I had my prostate checked some years ago, but it was deemed… normal, as far as I recall. Nothing significant, at least. I do take medication for my blood pressure, a small dose, prescribed by Dr. Novak. Aside from that… no, I wouldn’t say I have any conditions, Doctor. I try to stay active, walk the dog most days. I suppose I’m generally quite healthy, all things considered. Medicare covers everything, naturally.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… yes, I see it here. Amlodipine, 5mg. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I can eat anything, no dietary restrictions. I recall being stung by a bee as a child, but that was… a long time ago. No serious allergies, thankfully. It's really just this… issue with needing to go to the restroom so frequently. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a quick physical examination, then. Please follow me. We will start with your abdomen, and then I'll need to perform a digital rectal exam.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. Right. Well, Doctor, if you feel that is absolutely necessary, then, of course. Though, I must admit, I hadn’t anticipated that. Is there… is there any other way to determine the cause? I am rather… private, you see. But, if it's required, I suppose I can comply. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I assure you this is standard procedure. It is often required to properly assess the situation. I understand your discomfort, but a proper diagnosis necessitates a thorough examination. Please lie on your side on the examination table. We will keep it as brief and professional as possible.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I… trust your judgement. It’s just… a bit undignified, you understand. I suppose I’ve simply grown accustomed to a certain level of… privacy. Please let me know if there is anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. Prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but not markedly. No palpable nodules. I will need to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen blood test. These will help us determine the cause of your frequent urination.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well, that… that wasn't as unpleasant as I had feared, thankfully. A urinalysis and a blood test, you say? Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And… what exactly are we looking for? Is it something serious? I apologize for my constant questioning, but… naturally, I am a little anxious.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 2-3 business days. The urinalysis will check for infection or other abnormalities in your urine. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood; elevated levels can indicate prostate enlargement, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It can also be elevated due to infection or other factors. We'll discuss the results when they come back. For now, try to maintain a normal fluid intake and avoid excessive caffeine. And I suggest you avoid drinking anything two hours before bedtime. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… maintain normal fluid intake, avoid caffeine before bed, and wait for the results. Very well. Thank you for your time, and… for your patience. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. Though, if I may ask… is there anything I should be watching out for in the meantime? Any particular symptoms that would warrant a more immediate visit?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, if you develop a fever, chills, severe pain or blood in your urine, contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, try not to worry unnecessarily. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. We will discuss them then. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again. I shall contact the clinic immediately if any of those symptoms arise. And… I appreciate your… thoroughness. Have a good day to you as well. .
