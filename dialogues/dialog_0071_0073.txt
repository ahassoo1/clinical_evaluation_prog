DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Woodring. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. It’s been awful. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and nothing works. Honestly, I’m starting to think it's just something I have to live with.
DOCTOR: Okay, constantly running to the bathroom… that sounds unpleasant. And you said you’ve tried over-the-counter remedies without any luck?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. All those… Imodium things, Pepto-Bismol, the charcoal stuff… you name it. Waste of money, really. I expected more, frankly. It's been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a couple of weeks now? Maybe longer. I lose track. It's just… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive is a good word for it. A couple of weeks… alright. And is it… just diarrhea, or are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m tired, if that counts. Being up all night rushing to the toilet is exhausting. And I haven't really felt hungry. Not much appetite. But I mean, who would be, feeling like this? It’s not like it’s a picnic, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Tired and loss of appetite… understandable, given the situation. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No vomiting. Just… the other thing. And a lot of cramping. It feels like my insides are tying themselves in knots sometimes. Honestly, I'm not usually one to complain, but it’s… degrading. I've always been a very… put-together person. This is just not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, cramping along with the diarrhea… and no vomiting, good. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or anything that looks particularly unusual?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t ask me to look at it. Honestly. No, I haven’t… actively inspected it. I use the toilet, I flush. It's not exactly a hobby. But I think it’s just… normal color. Mostly. Look, I’m a painter, okay? I deal with colors all day, I don't need to analyze my… waste. Is this going somewhere? Because if it's just going to be a lot of questions, I really don’t have the patience.
DOCTOR: Right, a painter. I appreciate that you're not one for detailed inspections. No blood, which is good. Just to get a fuller picture, have you experienced any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: No fever. I mean, I might have felt a little warm sometimes, but I just chalked it up to the weather. It’s been hot, you know? And no chills. Body aches… I do a lot of bending and reaching when I paint, so I’m usually a little sore. That’s just… normal. Look, is this getting anywhere? I really don't understand why I need to answer all these questions. It’s diarrhea! People get diarrhea. Shouldn’t there just be something you can give me?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, even with something common like diarrhea. We need to figure out why it’s happening to you specifically. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or eaten anything unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean, "unusual"? I eat normal food. I haven’t been anywhere. I’ve been working. Painting a house, actually. A very large house. It's… a local job. I haven’t flown anywhere, if that’s what you’re getting at. This is ridiculous. I’m starting to feel like you’re implying I did something wrong to cause this.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all! I'm just trying to cover all the bases. Painting a house… that's good to know. And no changes in your diet, no new foods?
PATIENT: No! I eat the same things. Salmon, rice, vegetables... normal things. I'm not some adventurous foodie. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me something to make it stop? This is really interfering with my work. I have deadlines. People are counting on me. And frankly, this is embarrassing. I don't usually talk about this kind of thing with strangers.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and make sure everything sounds alright. Then we can discuss some possible options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be quick about it. And please don’t ask me to… demonstrate anything. This is already humiliating enough. Honestly. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a simple listen. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your abdomen in all four quadrants. It will only take a moment. I’m hearing some… increased bowel sounds, which is consistent with diarrhea. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright. It doesn’t seem to be anything immediately serious, but to be thorough, I’d like to order a stool sample to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample?! Seriously? You want me to… collect my… waste? This is beyond ridiculous. I’m a professional! I don't have time for this. Is there anything else you can do? Some kind of… pill? An injection? Anything to avoid that? Honestly, I’m starting to think I’d be better off just dealing with it. It’s humiliating and inconvenient, but at least I wouldn't have to go through this.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring. It’s not pleasant, I agree. However, it will help us determine if there's a bacterial or parasitic cause, which would require specific treatment. If it's a simple case of viral gastroenteritis, it will likely resolve on its own with supportive care – fluids and a bland diet. But we need to rule out other possibilities. In the meantime, I can prescribe something to help slow down the diarrhea and alleviate some of the cramping. It’s not a cure, but it should provide some relief. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill. Anything to avoid the… other thing. But if it doesn't work, I’m not coming back. Honestly. And don't expect me to be happy about it. What kind of pill is it? And are there any… side effects? I have deadlines, you know. I can't afford to be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: It's called loperamide. It helps slow down the movement of the gut, which should reduce the frequency of your bowel movements. Common side effects are mild constipation or abdominal discomfort, but they are usually manageable. If you experience any severe side effects, like severe abdominal pain or fever, please contact me immediately. I'm also going to recommend increasing your fluid intake and eating bland foods, like rice, bananas, and toast. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and alcohol. I'll send the prescription to your pharmacy now, and I'll give you a collection kit for the stool sample. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. I suppose. Honestly, it's just… a lot. I really don't have time for all this fuss. Just give me the kit, and let's get this over with. And I expect that pill to work. Otherwise… well, I won't be pleased. Is there anything else? Because I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The instructions are included in the box. And yes, that's all. I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Woodring. .
PATIENT: Right. Good. .
