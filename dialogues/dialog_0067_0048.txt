DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...fine. My wife, she made the appointment. Said I been a bit...scattered lately. Honestly, I feel alright. Just… things slip my mind. Not big things, you understand. More like… where I put my glasses, or what I had for breakfast. Small things. Though she worries. She says it’s more than just getting old.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good that your wife is looking out for you, and it’s perfectly normal to experience some memory changes as we get older. But it’s always good to check things out, especially when there’s a change in how you’re feeling or functioning. So, you said things slip your mind – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Slip is a good word. It’s not like I forget completely. More like… the word is on the tip of my tongue, you know? Or I’ll start a sentence and… well, where was I going with that? It’s frustrating. And it’s recent. I’ve always had a good memory. I can tell you exactly what I was doing the day Kennedy was shot, for example. But last month… I couldn’t remember where I parked the truck at the market. The market, Doctor. I go there every week.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Lason. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with recall, and that it’s a fairly new development. Knowing that you haven't had issues like this before, and that it’s affecting your daily routine – like remembering where you parked – is important. You mentioned being able to recall events from a long time ago very clearly. That's good – it suggests your long-term memory seems intact. We'll want to explore this a bit more. Let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you been feeling any other symptoms besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn't been the best, maybe. My wife makes lovely food, but I don't always finish my plate. And I’ve been a bit…tired, I suppose. Not sick tired, just… worn out. I used to be able to work all day setting tile, no problem. Now, I need a little nap in the afternoon sometimes. But that’s probably just age. Honestly, Doctor, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some fatigue. It's good you're able to pinpoint those changes. And I understand your feeling that it may just be age, but it's important to rule out anything else that could be contributing. Those symptoms can be associated with a number of different things. Now, thinking about your past health, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve always been a healthy man. Worked hard, ate good food, mostly. Had a bit of trouble with my back years ago from all the bending, but the chiropractor fixed me right up. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. My wife worries about everything, you know? She’s always reading those things online… says everyone has something wrong with them. But I feel alright.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Lason. No prior medical diagnoses is helpful information. And it’s understandable your wife is concerned; there’s a lot of information available online, and it can be easy to worry. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see…just my appendix when I was a boy. That was…a long time ago. Before the war, even. They took it out, and that was that. No problems since. Everything else is…original equipment, as they say. I haven’t been under the knife since.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an appendectomy as a child. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family…are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother…she got a bit confused towards the end, I suppose. She was very old, though. Lived to be ninety-two. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing major. And my sister…she had some trouble with her joints, arthritis. But that’s about it. We weren’t a sickly family. Mostly strong, hard-working people.
DOCTOR: Okay, some confusion in your mother later in life, high blood pressure in your father, and arthritis in your sister. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh. Just a little something for my back sometimes. When it flares up. It’s…ibuprofen, I think. Over the counter stuff. And sometimes a little something for my…constipation, if I haven’t been eating enough fruit. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and something for constipation occasionally. That's good to know. And I understand your preference to avoid medications if possible. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always teases me about it. She says I have the stomach of a goat. Never had any trouble with any kind of medicine either. Never needed much, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good, no known allergies. Now, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I set tile. Been doing it my whole life. I come home, I eat dinner with my wife, I watch the news. Sometimes I help her in the garden. It’s a quiet life. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Don’t smoke. Never did. I'm a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work as a tile setter, you enjoy gardening with your wife, you have a quiet lifestyle, and you don’t smoke or drink heavily. That gives me a good sense of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. It'll help me get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have some things to get done this afternoon. And I don’t want you poking around too much. But yes, go ahead. Just…be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Lason, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but I did notice some mild slowness in your reflexes and a slight unsteadiness in your gait when you walked. I also noticed some difficulty with recent memory during the quick assessment – for example, you struggled to recall the three words I asked you to remember just a few minutes ago.
PATIENT: Three words? Oh, now you mention it… I did forget those. See? This is what my wife is talking about. I knew something was off. It’s just… frustrating. And my blood pressure? Is that bad? I feel fine.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re frustrated, Mr. Lason. And it's good that you're acknowledging these changes. The slight difficulty with recall and the elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further. The elevated blood pressure isn’t immediately dangerous, but it’s something we want to manage. Uncontrolled high blood pressure over time can lead to more serious health problems. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. And lastly, I'd like you to do a simple memory test in the office, if you're willing. It’s just a short questionnaire that can help us assess the extent of any cognitive changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Doctor, that sounds…serious. What are you looking for? Is it something bad? And a memory test? I just told you I'm forgetting things! What’s the point? My wife will be happy, I suppose. She’s been wanting me to get checked out for ages. But a CT scan… that's a bit much, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. A CT scan can sound daunting, but it’s a non-invasive way to get a better look at your brain. We’re not necessarily looking for something bad, but we want to rule out any potential causes for your memory issues, like a small stroke, a tumor, or other structural problems. These are relatively rare, but it’s important to be thorough. The memory test is more to get a baseline, to quantify the extent of the difficulties you're experiencing. It helps us track any changes over time and determine the best course of action. I want to assure you, we're taking a cautious approach. I want to rule out any serious causes for your symptoms, but I also want to be prepared for the possibility that this could be something less concerning, like age-related cognitive decline or a vitamin deficiency. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the blood work and the CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. If you think it’s necessary. But I don’t want to be poked and prodded all day. And I don’t want to hear anything too alarming. My wife will have a fit. Just get it over with, Doctor. And please, be quick. My back is already starting to ache. And where will I even find the time? I have tiles to set, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. I'll make sure the process is as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll order the blood work now, and the nurse will schedule the CT scan for you. It typically takes about 30 minutes. I will also have the nurse print out the paperwork for the memory test. It shouldn’t take too long to complete, and we can review the results at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's a low dose, and it's often well-tolerated. We’ll monitor your levels closely. And I'm going to recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A low dose is good. I don’t want to be all drowsy and out of it. And two weeks… that’s fine, I suppose. As long as I don’t have to keep coming back here every five minutes. Just get me the results, and tell me what I need to do. And please, no complicated instructions. I'm a tile setter, not a doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. I’ll keep the instructions simple and straightforward. The nurse will go over the medication details with you before you leave, including potential side effects and how to take it properly. We’ll focus on getting the test results back and discussing them at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please contact the office immediately. Here's a summary of what we've discussed: blood work, CT scan, medication for blood pressure, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the scheduling information. Thank you for coming in today, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
