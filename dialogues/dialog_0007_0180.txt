DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. I'm just… tired. Really tired. And I… I eat dirt. Okay? Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It’s just… happening more and more. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Can we just get this sorted?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re feeling very tired and experiencing unusual cravings. It is a bit unusual to crave dirt, and I appreciate you being open with me about that—it takes courage to share things like that. We’ll definitely try to get this sorted out as efficiently as possible. First, let’s talk about this tiredness. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Describe? It feels like... being old, I guess. Like all my batteries are dead. I just want to sit. All the time. It’s not like a sleepy tired, it’s… heavy. And it's getting worse, like every day. I used to be able to… do things. Now, just thinking about it makes me want to lie down. What does it matter how it feels? It’s terrible. Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and getting progressively worse, even just thinking about activity makes you want to rest. That gives me a better idea. It does matter how it feels, because it helps me narrow down what might be going on. And we will move on. Just a few more quick questions about the tiredness, then we’ll talk about the… dirt craving. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, symptoms. Fine. Let me think… I get headaches. Dull ones, mostly. And… I guess I’ve been a little more… forgetful. My niece keeps having to remind me of things. It's probably just old age, to be honest. Honestly, I don't know what's a symptom and what's just… life. Can we please talk about the dirt now? This is what I came for.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and increased forgetfulness. That's helpful. It's understandable to wonder what's a symptom and what's just part of getting older, and that’s why we’re here – to figure that out. Alright, let's talk about the dirt. How long have you been craving dirt?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. I don’t know. A few months, maybe? It started small, just… picking at the garden when I was out weeding. Now I find myself… actively looking for it. It's embarrassing, okay? I just… have to have it sometimes. Like, a need. I don’t even like the taste! It's just… chalky. And I feel bad after. But I can’t stop. Is this a mental thing? Because if it is, I don’t want to go to a head doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, starting small and progressing to actively seeking it out despite not enjoying it and feeling bad afterward. That sounds distressing. This craving is called pica. It's not necessarily a mental health issue, although it can be associated with certain psychological conditions. More often, pica is linked to nutritional deficiencies. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings – anything besides dirt?
PATIENT: Nutritional… what? Look, I eat normal. I cook, I don’t eat junk food. I like tortillas, beans, that sort of thing. My husband – bless his soul – always said I made the best tortillas. He’s… gone now, though. A few years back. I don’t need a lecture on what I should be eating. No, just the dirt. And sometimes… ice. I eat a lot of ice. Does that count? It’s hot here, though. Everyone eats ice.
DOCTOR: Okay, tortillas and beans—sounds like a pretty good diet. And I definitely wasn’t planning a lecture. Just trying to get a full picture. Ice does count. Craving ice is actually quite common with certain deficiencies. Alright, a few more questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. I eat when I’m hungry. Maybe… less hungry lately? But that could just be the tiredness. I just don't feel like cooking sometimes. It’s a lot of effort. And I don’t have much company anymore. Honestly, it's all a bit… blah. Can we get on with the exam? I really need to get going. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite along with the tiredness. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your eyes and throat. Then I’ll feel your abdomen, just to get a sense of everything. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. Just… don't take too long. And be gentle, okay? My skin is sensitive. This is all a waste of time, probably. It's just old age. I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little low – 108/68. Your eyes look okay, a little pale. No obvious abnormalities. Throat looks clear. Okay, abdomen is soft, no tenderness… a little bit of… fullness. Nothing alarming. Alright, everything seems okay on initial exam, but I’d like to order some blood work just to rule out any deficiencies that could be causing these symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work? Of course. More poking and prodding. Look, just tell me what’s wrong. Is it something serious? Is this… cancer? I knew it. I just knew something was wrong. My mother died of… well, never mind. Just… tell me the truth. Don't sugarcoat it. I’m a big girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. Let's take a deep breath. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you there's no reason to jump to conclusions. It’s good you’re advocating for yourself and asking direct questions. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it’s unlikely to be cancer. However, we need to investigate. The blood work will check your iron levels, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and a complete blood count to look for anemia and other potential issues. It's also possible, given the dirt craving, that we need to check your zinc levels. That's what's most likely causing these symptoms. It's important to remember these are just possibilities right now. We’re going to rule things out before we worry about anything serious. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And can I get a piece of paper to write down the names of these… things? Iron, vitamin B… I’m terrible with remembering stuff. Honestly, I probably won’t even remember what you’re talking about in five minutes. But whatever. Let's just get the blood work done. I have to go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. I'll write down the tests we're ordering, so you have them for your records. Okay, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. Is there anyone who can help you get to and from appointments?
PATIENT: Help? No. I’m… I’m fine on my own. Always have been. My husband… he used to drive me, but… never mind. Just get it done. I need to go. And don't bother calling me. Just text. I forget the phone. Is that alright? Just text the results. Honestly, this is all so much… bother.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll text the results to your phone. No problem at all. Here’s a paper with the information about the tests and the clinic number if you have any questions. Please call the office if you start to feel worse before your appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Hedy. I hope we can figure this out quickly and get you feeling better.
