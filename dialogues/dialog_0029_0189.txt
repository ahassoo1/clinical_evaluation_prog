DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Chora. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to meet you? I doubt that. Anyway, it's my… well, it's my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And frankly, at my age, concerning is all there is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate, and you're right to be concerned, especially given your age. Let’s get some more details. When did you first notice the blood?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a couple of days ago, I suppose. Maybe three? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It wasn't like a gusher, you understand. More of a… a streak. A reddish tinge. And it's not like I haven't seen things in my life. I used to fly planes, you know. Real planes, not these little commuter jobs they have now. This isn't the worst thing I've seen, but it's still… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right, a streak, reddish tinge. And you said a couple of days ago. Has this happened before, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: No. Never. Eighty-eight years I’ve been on this earth, and this is a first. Though, to be fair, I haven’t always… paid attention to such things. It's not exactly polite dinner conversation, is it? But I do remember things being... different when I was younger. Everything's going downhill, I tell you. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new symptom for you. And just to clarify, you’ve noticed this blood with every bowel movement since you first saw it a couple of days ago, or just occasionally?
PATIENT: No, not every time! Heavens, no. Just… the last two times, I think. Maybe three. It's hard to be certain. My memory isn't what it used to be, though I resent the implication that I'm losing it. It’s just… things blend together after a while. You wouldn’t understand. You're still young.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been present in the last two or three bowel movements. And you said it wasn't a large amount. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits alongside this?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. It’s not like I'm keeping a log of the consistency and frequency! Honestly, young man, you ask a lot of… personal questions. I suppose it's… been a bit looser, maybe? Not a disaster, mind you. Just… not as firm as usual. And perhaps a little more urgent. But that could just be the coffee. I like a strong brew.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stool, more urgent, and possibly related to coffee. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating?
PATIENT: A little bit of… discomfort. Not pain, exactly. More of a… a rumbling. And a bit of gas, naturally. I am eighty-eight years old, you know. Things aren't exactly running like a Swiss watch anymore. It’s not like it keeps me up at night or anything. Just… aware that something's happening down there. And frankly, I'd rather not dwell on it. It's unpleasant enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, some discomfort, rumbling, and gas. And have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No, no sickness or anything like that. Perfectly alright, as far as that goes. No throwing up, no feeling hot, just… this. This bothersome blood. And all these questions. It’s like an interrogation. I flew planes during the war, you know. I faced real danger. This is just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, or fever. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, I used to have high blood pressure, years ago. They gave me a pill for it. Stopped taking it after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I don't like being drugged up. And my knees are shot, if that counts. Arthritis, they said. But other than that… I’ve been remarkably healthy, considering. I ate good food, drank good coffee, and stayed active. Most of my life, anyway. Until recently, of course. Everything's falling apart now. Just like the country.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, now managed without medication, and arthritis in your knees. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… there was a tonsillectomy when I was a boy. A rather unpleasant experience, as I recall. And… oh, yes. I had a hernia operation, decades ago. Quite a while back. They fixed it, as far as I know. Didn’t bother me much after that. And a few things here and there, little bits and pieces. Nothing major. I was always a reasonably healthy man. And I certainly didn't spend my life in doctor's offices like some people do.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, hernia repair decades ago, and some minor procedures. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I'm aware of. Never had a problem. I can eat anything. I like everything. Don't believe in coddling myself. A good strong cup of coffee is all I need. Though, I suppose I've gotten a bit sensitive to cold weather lately. But that's just old age, isn't it? Not an allergy. Honestly, you're asking an awful lot of questions about things that aren’t important. This blood is what's important. Not whether I get a sniffle in January.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees now and then, when they really flare up. Over the counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing regular, mind you. Only when I absolutely need it. And that coffee, if you count that as a medication. It keeps me going. Though, maybe it's causing this problem. I don’t know. Everything's a mess, isn’t it? Honestly, I’m getting tired of this. Can we just figure out what’s wrong with my… stool?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for your knees. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your frustration. Let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also need to do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It’s important to get a clear picture of what's going on, and this will help us determine the next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? At my age? Really? Look, I’ve lived a long life, young man. I've been poked and prodded enough times. I suppose I don't have much choice, do I? But I want you to be gentle. And quick. This is… undignified. And frankly, I'd rather be home, having that coffee. But fine. Do what you have to do. Just... hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie flat on your back, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay. No immediate signs of tenderness here. Now, if you’ll excuse me for just a moment. I’ll need you to bend over and we’ll proceed with the rectal exam. I will let you know what I find. Okay. I'm feeling some slight tenderness, and I do detect a small amount of blood on the examining glove. The stool seems a bit soft, as you mentioned. I will document these findings.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it serious? Don't tell me it's… that disease. I've known people… it's not a pleasant way to go. And all this poking and prodding… it’s undignified, I tell you. Just tell me straight. Is it bad? I’m an old man, I don't need sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, it's too early to say definitively what’s causing the bleeding. The tenderness and blood I detected are concerning, but they can be caused by a number of things – hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or even diverticulosis, which is common at your age. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s something serious, like cancer, but we need to investigate further to be sure. I recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. We can also take a biopsy if needed. I also want to order a complete blood count to check for anemia. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? You want to put a camera… where? At my age? Good heavens. This is getting worse and worse. I knew I should have stayed home. And a biopsy? Taking pieces out? This sounds… unpleasant. And expensive, I imagine. Look, I'm an old man. I've had a good life. Do I really need all this poking and prodding? Couldn’t we just… ignore it? Maybe it will go away on its own. Perhaps it is just the coffee. I don't know. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your hesitation. It's a lot to process, and you're right, it's not a pleasant procedure. However, ignoring it isn't a good option. The bleeding could be a sign of something serious, and early detection is key to successful treatment. While a colonoscopy is the most accurate way to determine the cause, we can start with a stool test to look for blood and certain genetic markers. It’s less invasive. If the stool test comes back positive, then we'll discuss the colonoscopy again. Regarding the cost, I will have our billing department contact you to discuss insurance options and potential financial assistance programs. We can also discuss the risks and benefits of each option in detail before making any decisions. What do you think about starting with the stool test?
PATIENT: A stool test… well, that's slightly less horrifying than having a camera shoved up there. Fine. A stool test. But if it leads to that other thing… I’m holding you personally responsible, young man. And don’t expect me to be polite about it. Just get it over with. And quickly. I want to go home and have some coffee. And please, don't ask me about my… consistency. I’ve had enough of that for one day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. No further questions about consistency, I promise. I’ll write the order for the stool test now, and our staff will provide you with the necessary collection kit and instructions. They will also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the kit. And hurry. I’ve wasted enough time here today. And if it turns out to be something serious… I'm blaming the coffee. Everything’s going downhill, I tell you. Everything. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need a nap. And a strong cup of coffee. When can I get the kit?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Our staff will bring the kit to you before you leave today. It's a fairly straightforward process, and they will explain everything in detail. It should only take a few minutes to collect the sample. And regarding the coffee… perhaps we can discuss moderation at your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then, Mr. Rowbottom. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good rest.
