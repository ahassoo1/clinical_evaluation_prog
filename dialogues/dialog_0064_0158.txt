DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s about a letter. Some place wants a letter saying I own a pet. Don’t even remember why they need it, but here I am. It’s probably for some apartment or something. People these days… always needing paperwork.
DOCTOR: Right, a letter confirming pet ownership. That's… understandable, I suppose. And you said you don't recall why you need the letter specifically?
PATIENT: No, not a clue. Honestly, I have a lot on my mind. I've always been… busy. Important things, you know? Not worrying about whether some building manager needs proof of a fluffy animal. It’s just… a letter. Do you need the pet’s name or something? I think it’s…Coco? Or maybe Cinnamon? Oh dear, this is ridiculous. I really should write these things down.
DOCTOR: It happens, Ms. Wrye. Don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. Knowing the pet's name isn't essential right now, but if it comes to you, that would be helpful. Just to be thorough, while we’re at it, what kind of pet are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A pet. Um… a dog, I think. A small one. A yappy one, probably. My ex-husband… he liked small, yappy dogs. Said they were good watchdogs. Honestly, I wasn’t really paying attention to the details. It was… a long time ago. Was it a poodle? Or a… a terrier? Ugh, this is awful. I’m usually very good with things, you know. Just not… pets.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a small dog. That's a good start. And you weren't directly involved in the pet's care, is that right?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. My ex… he handled everything. Feeding, walking, the… the vet visits. I just… lived with it. It was more his thing, you see? I have… other interests. More important things to focus on. Not to say I didn’t like the little thing, but… I wasn’t responsible for it. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Wrye. You weren't the primary caregiver. That’s perfectly alright. We just need to gather enough information for this letter. Do you happen to know roughly how old the dog is, or when you acquired it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… never been my strong suit. Let me think… He got it… after the divorce, I think. So, sometime after… 2020? Maybe? It was small then, so it can’t be too old. A puppy, probably. A tiny, yappy puppy. He was always going on about how it was hypoallergenic or something. Honestly, it all blends together after a while. You know how it is. A lot of years, a lot of… things happening.
DOCTOR: Right, so a dog acquired after 2020. That gives us a timeframe. And you mentioned it was hypoallergenic. Do you recall why that was important?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now you’re asking the right questions. He had… sensitivities, you see? Allergies. Terrible allergies. Always sneezing, always complaining. He said a hypoallergenic dog wouldn't bother his sinuses. That’s why he insisted on that particular breed, I think. A poodle mix, maybe? Something fancy. Honestly, he was always very particular about these things. It wasn’t my choice, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, just to confirm for the letter, would you say you owned this dog at any point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… that's a tricky question, isn't it? He bought it, so technically… yes, I suppose. It was part of the divorce settlement. Everything was divided, you see. So, legally… I owned it. Though I didn’t do anything with it. Does that make any sense? It was… a complicated situation. He insisted on me taking it, said it would be good for me. Honestly, I think he just wanted to be rid of it. A lot of drama.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. So, legally you took ownership of the dog as part of the divorce settlement, but were not the primary caregiver. That’s… good to know. For the letter, it’s important to be accurate. Do you have any documentation regarding the divorce settlement that mentions the dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Documentation? Now there’s a thought. Let me think… I had a lawyer, of course. A very expensive lawyer. He kept everything. Boxes and boxes of papers. Somewhere in the attic, I think. A horrible mess, honestly. I haven’t been up there in years. It’s full of… things. Old furniture, boxes of… memories. Probably all covered in dust. I really should sort it out, but… I just haven’t had the time. Would it really be necessary? A letter is just a letter, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ideally, yes, it would be best to have something confirming the transfer of ownership. But we can proceed without it for now. I can write a letter stating you legally acquired a small dog as part of your divorce settlement, and that you were the registered owner as of [date - I’ll estimate based on the divorce date]. However, it may not be sufficient for whatever organization requires it. Would you like me to proceed with that for now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfectly adequate. Yes, go ahead. Just get it over with, really. I have… other things to do. Important things. And frankly, I don’t want to spend any more time thinking about this little yappy dog. Just write the letter, and I’ll be on my way. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I understand. I’ll just need your address and the date of the divorce to complete the letter. And, if you happen to recall the approximate breed, that would be helpful, but not essential. Just let me know if you think of anything. I can have this printed and ready for you in a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, um… my address is… 14 Oakwood Drive, right here in the city. And the divorce… let me think… 2019, I think. Yes, 2019. As for the breed… honestly, I really have no idea. A poodle mix, maybe? Something fluffy. He liked things that looked… fancy. Don't bother looking it up. It really doesn't matter, does it? Just get the letter done, Doctor. I appreciate it. Really, I do. I just want to be finished with this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, here you go. It confirms your legal ownership of a small dog acquired in 2019. I've included a statement that the specific breed is unknown. Hopefully, this will suffice. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
