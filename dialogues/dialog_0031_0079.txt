DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, to be honest, but my bruising... it's just gotten worse. I'm on a blood thinner, and I'm bumpin' into things more, I guess. It’s just… a lot more noticeable now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to have it checked out. Bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is something we definitely need to discuss. Let's start with a little more detail about this bruising. When did you first notice it becoming more frequent or noticeable?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, I'd say, maybe a month ago? Small things at first, like a little mark if I knocked my arm. But the last week or so it's been... bigger. And I don't even remember hitting myself sometimes. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m made of glass these days.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Hainley. That’s a concerning change. And it’s good you’re noticing it. You mentioned being on a blood thinner – could you tell me which one you’re taking, and what it’s for?
PATIENT: Oh, um... Warfarin, I think? Yeah, Warfarin. The doctor put me on it after I had a blood clot in my leg a couple years back. DVT, they called it. It was awful. They said I’d need to be on it for a while, maybe forever. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details, just that it was serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for a DVT history. That’s important information. And you’ve been on it for a couple of years now. Have you had your INR checked regularly while on Warfarin?
PATIENT: Regularly? I think so. They made me go for blood tests at first, a lot of them. Then it slowed down. I go to the lab down the road, and they send the results somewhere. I don't really pay attention to the numbers, just that they tell me if I’m okay. It’s been… a while since they called me with any problems, so I figured everything was fine.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’ve been managing with regular monitoring, but it’s good we’re revisiting this now. To get a clearer picture, do you recall when your last INR check was?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is where my memory gets fuzzy. Let me think… I went to see my regular doctor, Dr. Chen, for my yearly check-up in... February, maybe? And they probably did it then. But I don’t remember getting a call about it. Definitely haven't had one since then. Does that help? I really don't keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Hainley. February is a bit of a gap. Okay, let’s move on to other things. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalk that up to work. I work long hours. And... sometimes my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth, but that's happened on and off for years. Is that… something to worry about? I’m probably just brushing too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional gum bleeding. Both can be related to Warfarin, or other things. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising more closely. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have a meeting this afternoon. I really don't want to be late. It’s a big one.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hainley. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds are clear, no unusual murmurs or wheezing. Now, could you please point to the areas where you've been experiencing the most bruising?
PATIENT: Um, okay. Mostly my arms, from bumping into things at work. And my shins, I keep kicking the furniture, I think. And that little spot on my thigh, I don't even remember how I did that. It just… appeared. It’s not painful, just… there. I’m tellin’ ya, I’m a mess these days.
DOCTOR: I see. The bruising does appear more widespread than one might expect with minor trauma. The color is consistent with bruising of varying ages. I'm also noting some small petechiae on your lower legs. These are tiny blood spots under the skin. Given your history of Warfarin use and these findings, I’m concerned about possible over-anticoagulation or another underlying cause for the increased bleeding tendency. I would like to order a complete blood count and a repeat INR to assess your current level of anticoagulation and rule out any other blood abnormalities. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Look, I really don't have time for a lot of this, Doctor. I got a job to do. But… if you think it's important, I guess. Just… can you try to get the results back quickly? And… what exactly are we looking for? I hate not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. I will certainly expedite the testing process as much as possible. The CBC will give us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets – essentially, the components of your blood. The repeat INR will tell us how thin your blood is. We are looking to see if your INR is within the therapeutic range for your DVT history. If it’s too high, it means your blood is too thin, and you’re at higher risk of bleeding. If your CBC shows any abnormalities, it could indicate another underlying issue. While we await the results, I’m going to advise you to be extra cautious to avoid any injuries. Avoid strenuous activities, and if you do happen to get injured, apply direct pressure to the area for a prolonged period. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Extra cautious… got it. I try to be, honestly. It’s just hard when you're busy. Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Just… sensitive stomach, sometimes. But that's it. Look, can I just get a note for work? Explain I was at the doctor? They're gonna give me a hard time about missin' a meeting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hainley. I can absolutely write you a note for work. I’m documenting my findings from today’s examination: patient reports increased bruising, particularly on forearms and shins, with associated fatigue and occasional gum bleeding. The examination revealed widespread bruising and petechiae on lower legs. I’ve ordered a CBC and repeat INR. Here is the note for your employer. I will also have the lab results faxed to my office as soon as they are available. I will give you a call to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, thanks. That’s… good. No, I don't think so. Just… try to be quick about it, okay? I really need to know what’s going on. And… thanks for not makin' me wait too long. It means a lot. I guess… that’s it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any significant bleeding or develop any new symptoms in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
