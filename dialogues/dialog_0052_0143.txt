DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. I think it’s about… starting a family. My, uh, partner and I… we’re thinking about having a baby. I just… want to make sure everything is okay, you know? I’m not… I don’t really know where to start, to be honest. I’m getting older, and… well, it feels like a good idea to check things before we try.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Mr. Verrall. It's excellent that you're thinking proactively about this. And you’re right, it is a good idea to assess your overall health before starting a family. To get started, let's gather some information. First, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s… a tough one. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time, I think. Maybe… ten years? More? I… I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles. Nothing serious. As an adult… I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder when I was fixing the roof. And… I think I had a bad flu a few years ago. But nothing… major. I don’t really remember much else, to be honest. I’m sorry. Is that okay? I’m not very good with remembering dates and details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's common for patients to have gaps in their medical recall, especially if they haven't seen a doctor regularly. We’ll do our best to piece things together. So, you mentioned breaking your arm. Was that treated by a doctor, and do you recall any complications from that injury?
PATIENT: Yes, I went to the hospital, of course. They put it in a cast. It was… painful for a while. I think I had to go back a few times to get it checked. No… I don't think there were any complications, not that I remember. It healed okay, eventually. I can move it just fine. They just… told me to be careful. I was a bit clumsy, even then. I don’t… I don’t recall any follow-up appointments or anything like that. Just the cast, and then… they took it off. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m not saying anything useful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Verrall. Knowing there were no reported complications from the fracture is good. And it's perfectly fine – we are just gathering information. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He… he passed away when I was young, from a heart attack. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it. And… my sister, she has… arthritis, I think it is. In her hands, mostly. She’s always complaining about the pain. That’s… that’s about all I can remember. They were… Kurdish, both of them. We didn’t… we didn’t talk about health much, back then. It wasn’t really a thing. I hope that helps? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Verrall. Knowing about the history of heart disease, hypertension, and arthritis in your family is important information. It doesn’t sound like you have a lot of specific details, and that’s alright. We will proceed with that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Okay. I… I used to be more active. When I was younger, I did a lot of hiking. Now… not so much. I work a lot. Sales engineer, you know? Lots of travel, lots of meetings. I try to eat okay. Mostly… I eat what my partner cooks. She’s a good cook. I… I drink coffee, a few cups a day. And… sometimes I have a glass of wine with dinner. I don’t smoke, never have. I… I don’t really exercise much, I have to admit. I should, I know. It’s just… hard, with work. I try to get enough sleep, but… sometimes it’s difficult. Is that… enough? I feel like I’m just rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Verrall. You’re not rambling at all. This is all very useful information. It sounds like you've led an active life in the past and are now focused on your work. To get a clearer picture of your current health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your body. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Hmm. Weight… I think I've put on a little weight in the last few years. Not much, but… enough to notice. My appetite is… okay, I guess. It hasn't really changed. But my energy levels… they've definitely gone down. I get tired more easily now. Especially after traveling. It takes me longer to recover. And… sometimes I just feel… sluggish, even when I've had enough sleep. I don't know… I just feel older, I guess. It’s probably just age, isn't it? I don’t… I don’t really know what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these changes, Mr. Verrall. It’s important to investigate what might be contributing to the fatigue and weight gain, even if it is simply age-related. Now, I’d like to ask about any specific symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, any difficulty urinating, any pain in your chest, or any unusual lumps or bumps anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: Oh… those are… personal questions, aren't they? Um… bowel habits… I think they're okay. Maybe a little… irregular sometimes, but nothing serious. Difficulty urinating… no, not really. Chest pain… no, I haven’t had any chest pain. Unusual lumps or bumps… no, I don’t think so. I… I haven’t really been checking, to be honest. I’m not very good at… self-exams. Is that… okay? I feel a bit embarrassed now. I haven’t been to the doctor in so long, I don’t even know what I’m supposed to be looking for. And… I haven't noticed anything obvious, if that makes sense. I really am sorry if I'm not being very helpful. I'm just… not used to this.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Verrall, and there is absolutely no need to apologize. These are personal questions, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel a bit embarrassed or unsure. We're just trying to gather as much information as possible. Given your age and family history, and the changes you’ve described, I would like to perform a physical exam. This will allow me to assess your overall health and identify any potential concerns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, I guess so. If you think it’s necessary. I… I haven’t had one in years. What… what will it involve? I don’t want to be surprised. And… I’m a bit worried, to be honest. What if you find something… bad? I just want to make sure everything is okay, for… for the baby. And… for my partner. I don’t want to worry her. Is it going to hurt? I’m not very good with… needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Verrall. I completely understand your apprehension. A physical exam will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. I will also take a look at your skin. I’ll be palpating your abdomen, listening with a stethoscope, and looking at your skin. Regarding needles, we may need to draw a small sample of blood for some routine blood work. I can explain the process in detail, and we can take it slow and steady. We'll start with the least invasive parts of the exam first. The purpose of the exam and blood work is to get a baseline understanding of your health. It doesn’t necessarily mean we're looking for something bad. It simply allows us to ensure you’re in the best possible condition, should you and your partner decide to start a family. Would you like me to explain each step as we go through it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would… help a lot. Explaining each step… that would be good. I just… I get anxious easily. And… I don't like surprises. So, yes, please explain everything before you do it. And… I’m really glad you’re taking the time to listen to my concerns. It's… it’s been a long time since someone has taken the time to listen. Where… where do we start? And… is it okay if I ask questions if I get worried? I probably will. I just want to… be prepared.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. That’s what I’m here for. We will take things at your pace, and you can ask as many questions as you need – at any time. It's completely understandable to feel anxious, and I want to make this as comfortable as possible for you. We’ll start with your vital signs. I’m going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I'll need to wrap a cuff around your arm for the blood pressure. Then I'll just place a thermometer under your tongue for a moment to check your temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I always worry about my blood pressure being high, because I get nervous at the doctor. But… I’ll try to relax. Just… take it slow, okay? And… I’ll try to breathe deeply. I’m… I’m ready, I think. As ready as I can be, anyway. What… what happens after the blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Perfect, Mr. Verrall. You’re doing great. I’ll count down and then inflate the cuff briefly. It will feel a bit tight on your arm for a moment, but it shouldn't be painful. After the blood pressure, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I'll ask you to take a few deep breaths while I listen. It won't be invasive – I'm simply listening for any unusual sounds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds alright. Deep breaths… I can do deep breaths. I always feel a bit silly when I have to breathe deeply for the doctor, like I’m performing. But… I’ll try. Just… let me know if you hear anything strange, okay? I always worry about my heart. My father… he had a bad heart, you know. But… I’m trying to stay calm. Just… take it slow.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Just breathe normally. Your heartbeat is regular, and your breathing sounds clear so far. I’m hearing no unusual sounds at this point. It's good you're focusing on your breathing – that's excellent. Next, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, meaning I'll press lightly on your stomach to feel for any abnormalities. This will help me assess the size and shape of your organs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Palpate… pressing on my stomach? Um… yes, I guess so. Is it going to hurt? I always get a bit nervous when people touch my stomach. I… I have a bit of a sensitive stomach. Just… be gentle, okay? And… let me know if it feels uncomfortable. I… I’m ready, I think. As ready as I can be. But… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. I will be very gentle. I’m simply feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. I’ll slowly move around, applying very light pressure. If you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately. Alright… just relaxing your abdomen for me. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Um… a little. On the… left side. Not… bad, just… a little uncomfortable. I get… indigestion sometimes. Especially when I’m stressed. Is that… what you’re feeling? It’s probably just indigestion. I… I ate something heavy last night. My partner made a… a stew. It was very good, but… maybe a bit too much. Is that… what you’re feeling? It’s probably just the stew. It’s okay, you don’t need to worry about it. It’s just indigestion. Probably.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Verrall. It’s good you pinpointed the area of discomfort. Given your history of indigestion and the timing with the stew, it's very plausible that's the cause. To be thorough, I would like to listen to your bowel sounds with a stethoscope. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bowel sounds… Is that… embarrassing? I always feel a bit silly when people listen to my stomach. But… if you think it’s necessary… yes, okay. Just… don’t be surprised if it’s… noisy. I had that stew, remember? It’s probably very active. Just… get it over with quickly, okay? I… I’m ready, I think. As ready as I can be. But… quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit self-conscious, and it’s not embarrassing at all. And yes, given the stew, a little activity is expected. Alright… I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. They’re active, as expected, but nothing concerning. Now, to complete the physical exam, I’m going to check your reflexes and examine your skin. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Reflexes and skin… I guess so. As long as it doesn’t hurt. My skin is… not very good. I spend a lot of time in the sun when I'm traveling. And I'm getting older, you know? It's… wrinkly. And I have a few… moles. Nothing serious, I think. But… I worry about skin cancer. My partner keeps telling me to wear sunscreen, but… I forget. Is that… okay? Just… be gentle, okay? I'm ready, I think. As ready as I can be. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. I will be very gentle. Examining your skin is a good opportunity to check for any changes and address your concerns about skin cancer. Your reflexes are normal. This mole looks benign, but it's important to monitor it for any changes in size, shape, or color. I recommend having it checked by a dermatologist as a precaution. Your partner is right to encourage sunscreen use – that’s excellent preventative care. Alright, the physical exam is complete. I've noted your normal reflexes and the benign mole on your arm. Overall, your physical exam is reassuring. Now, let’s discuss your medical history and what we've learned today. Do you have any questions before we move on?
PATIENT: A dermatologist… That sounds… expensive. And… I don’t really like going to specialists. But… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I’ll… try to make an appointment. But… I’m worried about the cost. And… what about the rest of it? Am I… healthy enough to try for a baby? That’s what I came here for, remember? Is everything… okay? I just want to make sure everything is okay, for the baby. And… for my partner. Is there anything I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Verrall. I understand your worry about the cost of a dermatologist visit. We can discuss options for affordable care, and I can provide you with resources in the area. Now, regarding your question about being healthy enough to try for a baby, based on the physical exam and the information you’ve provided, you appear to be in generally good health. However, given your age and family history, I recommend a few additional tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function. We should also perform a urine analysis to screen for any underlying conditions. And given your father's heart history, an EKG would be prudent to evaluate your heart rhythm. These tests will provide us with valuable information and help us identify any potential risks or concerns. With the results of these tests, we can have a more informed conversation about your overall health and whether it’s safe to proceed with trying for a baby. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. It seems like all you want to do is give me more tests. But… okay. If it’s necessary. I just want to make sure everything is okay. And… will the tests be expensive? I’m worried about the cost. I don’t have insurance, you know. I just… I don’t want to get a huge bill. Can you help me with the cost? Is there anything I can do to make it more affordable? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m impatient. I just want to know if I can try for a baby, you know? Will it take a long time? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the wait time, Mr. Verrall. It's completely reasonable to feel anxious about that. Let's address the cost first. I'm aware that you don't have insurance, and I can certainly help you explore options for affordable testing. Many labs offer discounted rates for self-pay patients, and I can provide you with a list of labs in the area that offer those discounts. We can also discuss payment plans, if needed. I will also check if there are any local resources or programs that can help cover the cost of testing. I want to make this as manageable as possible for you. Regarding the wait time, the results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I know that can feel like a long time, but it's important to have accurate results before making any decisions. I can also expedite the process, if possible. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan that's right for you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress levels. Those are all important factors in overall health and fertility. Would you like me to go ahead and order the tests for you, and we can discuss the cost and payment options?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. Go ahead and order the tests. I just want to get it over with. Just… let me know how much it’s going to cost, and I’ll try to figure it out. And… can you write down the names of the labs, and the resources you mentioned? I’m not very good at remembering things, you know. And… can you also write down what I need to do to prepare for the tests? I don’t want to mess anything up. And… thank you. For listening, and for trying to help. I really appreciate it. I just want to make sure everything is okay, for the baby.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. I'm happy to help. Here is the lab requisition form. You can take this to any of the labs on this list. This sheet lists the preparation instructions for each test. It’s important to follow these instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. Fasting for 12 hours before the blood tests is important, and avoiding caffeine on the day of the tests will help. I’ve also written down my contact information, so please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll get this figured out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you. For everything. I really appreciate your help. I just… I just want to have a healthy baby. And… thank you for listening. It means a lot. I’ll… I’ll see you when the results are back. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you throughout this process. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, Mr. Verrall. I wish you all the best.
