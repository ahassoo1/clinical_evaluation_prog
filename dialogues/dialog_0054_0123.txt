DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just… driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be incredibly bothersome. A few weeks ago... can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… around the middle of July, maybe? It wasn't constant at first, just little spots here and there. But now… it seems to be everywhere. Mostly on my arms and back, I think. It’s worse at night, definitely. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it started in mid-July with little spots, and it’s progressively gotten worse, now covering mostly your arms and back, and is particularly troublesome at night. Is it a generalized itch all over, or are there specific areas that are more affected than others?
PATIENT: It's pretty much everywhere, but you're right, my back is the worst. It's hard to reach, so I can't really help the itching back there, you know? My legs are itchy too, but not as bad as my back and arms. And… sometimes my stomach will get a little itchy, but that comes and goes. I haven’t noticed it on my face, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily your back and arms are the most affected, with some involvement of your legs and occasional itching on your stomach. No facial involvement, which is good. Has anything changed recently that you can think of – new soaps, detergents, lotions, foods, or have you been traveling anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question! Let me see… No new soaps or detergents. I’ve been using the same things for years. Lotion… no, not really. I don’t use a lot of lotion. Travel? No, I haven’t been anywhere since… well, before the pandemic, honestly. Just staying home mostly. I did start taking a new vitamin a few months back, a multivitamin, but that was before the itching started.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in soaps, detergents or lotions, no recent travel, and you started a multivitamin a few months ago before the itching began. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you describe the itch itself?
PATIENT: Hmm, how to describe it… It's not like a burning itch, it's more… a crawling feeling? And it makes me want to scratch immediately. Like, I can't ignore it, you know? Sometimes it feels bumpy, even though I don’t see a lot of bumps. Other times it’s just… really annoying. It's hard to explain! It's just… itchy. And sometimes it keeps me up all night.
DOCTOR: I understand, it sounds incredibly frustrating. A crawling sensation with an intense urge to scratch, even without visible bumps, is a good description. And the nighttime worsening is a key symptom. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think… No, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. I used to have high blood pressure, many years ago, but it was under control with medication. I stopped taking the medication a long time ago, and the doctor said it was fine. Other than that… no, nothing that I’m aware of. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I walk a little every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that was previously controlled with medication, but has been off medication for a long time. And generally healthy otherwise. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. I used to take penicillin as a kid, and I don't think I had any problems with it. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t really have any known allergies, no. I eat shellfish, I have cats… nothing bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements – besides the multivitamin you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin. That’s it. Really. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I prefer to just… deal with things, you know? I don’t like feeling like I’m reliant on medication. I used to take something for my nerves, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the multivitamin. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m examining your skin now. I see a few small, scratched bumps, mostly on your arms and back. It doesn't appear to be a classic rash, and there's no significant redness or swelling. I don’t feel any unusual lumps or bumps. It looks like you've been scratching a lot, which is consistent with your symptoms. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. My heart is usually okay, but I get a little breathless sometimes when I walk up hills. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no unusual noises. And your lungs are clear. Now, just one more quick thing. I’m going to check your lymph nodes, just to see if there’s any swelling. Okay, your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing pruritus – itchy skin – of unknown cause. There are many potential reasons for this, and it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact reason without further investigation. Possible causes could include dry skin, allergies , or even a reaction to something you’re using or eating. The fact that it’s worse at night could be due to fluctuations in body temperature or hormone levels. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's… a lot of information. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. And I haven’t changed anything about my routine, really. So, you're saying you don’t know why I’m itchy? That’s a little frustrating, honestly. But… okay. What do we do now?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It is frustrating when we can’t pinpoint the exact cause immediately. Often, pruritus is multifactorial – meaning there isn't one single cause, and it can take some time to figure it out. Here’s what I recommend as a first step. I'd like to start with some conservative measures to see if they provide relief. We can also consider some basic tests to rule out some common causes. First, I recommend using a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Cool compresses can also help soothe the itch. We can also try an over-the-counter antihistamine, like cetirizine or loratadine, at night to see if that helps reduce the itching while you sleep. I also want to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the itching. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Gentle moisturizer, cool compresses, and those pills at night… I can try that. And the blood tests… yes, that’s fine. I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry. Will those tests tell you if it’s my thyroid or something else? And… how long do I have to try the other things before we see if they work?
DOCTOR: Yes, the CBC will give us a general overview of your blood health, and the TSH test specifically checks your thyroid function. Thyroid problems can sometimes cause itchy skin. As for how long to try the conservative measures, let’s aim for two weeks. If you don't see any improvement after two weeks, or if the itching gets worse, we can discuss other options, such as a referral to a dermatologist. It's important to give it a fair trial, as it can sometimes take time to see results. I'm going to write you a prescription for the cetirizine, and I'll send the lab orders for the blood tests to the lab. You can go to [Lab Name] on [Address]. They’re open [Hours]. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, two weeks. Cetirizine… and the lab on [Address]. I think I can find that. I don’t think I have any questions… other than, is this something serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, and it’s good you asked. Most cases of pruritus are not caused by a serious underlying condition. However, it's always important to rule out potential causes, which is why we’re doing the blood tests. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m not overly concerned, but we want to be thorough. The blood tests will help us get a clearer picture and ensure we’re not missing anything. If you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the office immediately. But for now, let's focus on trying the conservative measures and see if they provide some relief. I will also provide you with written instructions outlining everything we discussed today. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll try those things and see what happens.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here if you have any questions or concerns. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes or if you're not feeling better. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find some relief soon. Please follow up with us in two weeks to let us know how you’re doing. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
