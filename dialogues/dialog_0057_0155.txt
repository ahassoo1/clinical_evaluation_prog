DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Hard to say exactly how long. Time… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint these things. When you say “a while now,” would you say it’s been weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, definitely. Longer than just a few weeks. Maybe… six months? A year? I really couldn’t say for certain. It comes and goes, which makes it hard to keep track. It's not constant, thankfully. Just… bothersome when it does happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months to a year, coming and going. That’s helpful. And where does the shaking happen, primarily?
PATIENT: Mostly my right hand, like I said. Sometimes my whole arm feels… jittery. Rarely my leg, but it's mostly the hand. When I try to write, that’s when I notice it the most. Makes a mess, usually.
DOCTOR: I see. And is the shaking present when you are at rest, or only when you’re trying to do something, like writing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it’s worse when I'm trying to do something. Like holding a cup of coffee, or… well, writing, like I mentioned. When I'm just sitting… it's usually alright. Though, sometimes I feel a little… twitchy even then. Not as bad, mind you. Just a little… unsettled. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it sounds like it's primarily an action tremor – meaning it happens when you're using your hand. Now, has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Contributing…? Oh, dear. What do you mean? No, not really. Same old routine. I go to the plant, check the systems… get things done. Divorced years ago, so no… changes on that front either. No new medications, nothing like that. Everything's been pretty… steady, if you know what I mean. Just… older, I suppose. Is that a thing? Getting older?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a thing, Mr. Jezik! Getting older can definitely contribute to changes in our bodies. Let’s talk a little bit more about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that's… blurry. I went to the doctor years ago, of course, for the usual things. A bad cold here, a bit of a cough there. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Honestly, I can’t recall anything specific. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Maybe something with my blood pressure at one point? But I really couldn't say. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, I think. A long, long time ago. But that's about it. Definitely no surgeries recently, or even… in adulthood. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Or… maybe just avoided the doctor enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my wife, we're… divorced, like I said. No children. My parents are gone now, both of them. As for medical things… they were Czech, you know? Not much talk about illnesses back then. Just… tough it out, usually. I don't recall anyone having… shaking like this. Maybe my mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older, but I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s all a bit foggy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not a one. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Vitamins… maybe a multivitamin a while back, but I stopped that. I try to eat alright, you know? Nothing fancy. Just… regular food. I haven't been feeling sick enough to need anything, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No bee stings, no rashes… Nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky, really. Although… I do get a little stuffy nose sometimes during the spring, but I just think that's the pollen.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Can you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Careful now, don’t want to make a mess. This hand’s a little shaky, as you can see. Just… take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the tremor. And I’m just checking for any tenderness. Everything feels normal there. Now, could you please tap your thumb against each of your fingers, one at a time, with each hand?
PATIENT: Alright. One, two, three, four… this is harder than it looks. This hand just doesn’t want to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright. Careful now… don’t want to fall. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Jezik. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often of the hands, and it can worsen with age. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possible causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical issues. I'm also considering a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Essential tremor… never heard of it. Blood tests, eh? Well, alright. If it'll help figure things out, I suppose. A neurologist… sounds… serious. But, if you think it's best, I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… want this shaking to stop, you know? Makes things difficult. So, blood tests first, then maybe see this… neurologist? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Blood tests first to rule out other possible causes, and then we can discuss a referral to a neurologist if needed. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Mr. Jezik. A neurologist is a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, and they can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss potential treatment options. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples today. She’ll give you instructions on how to prepare for the tests. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if the shaking becomes significantly worse or if you experience any other new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… getting the blood drawn. Alright. Not looking forward to that. And… a neurologist. Will this… condition… get worse over time? That’s probably a silly question. But I'd like to know, if you don’t mind. It's just… hard to plan things when you don't know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what to expect. Essential tremor can progress over time, but the rate of progression varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience very slow progression, while others may experience more rapid worsening. It’s often difficult to predict. However, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. These include medications, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, surgery. The good news is that essential tremor is usually not life-threatening. It can be frustrating and challenging to live with, but many people are able to live full and active lives despite having it. We'll discuss all of your options in more detail once we have the blood test results and, if needed, after you've seen the neurologist. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done and taking things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, one step at a time. That sounds… manageable. Alright. Blood tests it is. Tell the nurse… tell her I'm not a fan of needles. Just so she knows. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It's… reassuring, I suppose. Even if it’s not exactly good news. I think that’s all for now. I should probably get going. Don’t want to hold up your afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. And I will definitely let the nurse know about the needles. She's very good at making patients comfortable. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good afternoon. And please, be careful on your way home. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll see you soon, I guess. .
