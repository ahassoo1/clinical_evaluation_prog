DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning? I work with the metal… sheets. It’s… hard work. I don't really remember what he said exactly. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband has some concerns about your health, and you work with metal sheets – that’s good to know. Just to clarify, when he says "learning," is he referring to any new symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What’s that mean? I just… feel tired, sometimes. And my hands… they hurt after a long day. Is that a symptom? I don't know. Everything hurts a little when you bend metal all day, right? It's a normal job.
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue and hand pain can certainly be symptoms. A symptom is simply a sign that something might be going on in your body. And you're right, hand pain is common with physical work like bending metal. But we want to make sure there isn’t something more going on. Could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: More? It's just… I sleep, and then I'm tired again. It's not like I’m always tired. Just… after work, mostly. And sometimes on the weekends. I used to have more energy. But things change, right? I don’t know what else to say. It’s just… tiredness.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It sounds like the tiredness is interfering with your life a bit, and it's changed from how you usually feel. Okay. And when you say it’s interfering with your life… does it make it harder to do things around the house?
PATIENT: Around the house? Well, my husband helps a lot. He likes to cook. I mostly… clean. But even that… it's harder now. I get… out of breath, easily. And my back… it aches. Not all the time, but enough. I don’t complain much. He worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, hand pain, shortness of breath, and back aches. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s helpful to get a clear picture. Before we continue, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat everything. My husband makes me try new things. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes after I use certain cleaning stuff at work? But that's just the smell, I think. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. I don’t like taking pills. My mother always said they’re bad for you. Just… regular things. You know, water. Food. I eat healthy, mostly. My husband makes sure of it. He’s very… careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. Now, I'd like to ask a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? No. I don’t think so. I went to the doctor a long time ago… before I got married. Just a check-up. They said I was… fine. But that was a long time ago. Things change, right? I don’t remember anything specific. He always does the check-ups, now. He’s very good at that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve been lucky, I guess. A few scrapes and bruises at work, but nothing serious enough for a hospital. I just… put a bandage on it. My husband always says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family... are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he had… problems with his feet. He walked with a cane later in life. But that was a long time ago. They both lived long lives, though. My husband says it doesn't matter much, family history. Everyone is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother and foot problems in your father. It’s good to know. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Could you tell me a little bit about your work environment?
PATIENT: Work? It's… loud. Lots of metal banging. And dusty. We wear masks, sometimes. It’s hot in the summer. And cold in the winter. We bend metal… all day. Sheets, mostly. It's… hard work. What kind of questions are these? It’s just a job.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem repetitive, Ms. Fontanazza. It helps me to understand what might be contributing to how you’re feeling. Knowing about your work environment is important. Now, regarding social habits… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My husband would kill me. Alcohol… maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just on special occasions. Nothing much. And drugs? Absolutely not. I don’t even like looking at them. What kind of questions are these? I’m a hardworking woman!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Fontanazza, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I’m simply trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. It's a standard part of a medical evaluation. Now, would you be comfortable if I listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect anything. I told you, I’m a hardworking woman. It's just tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, around 98 beats per minute. Breathing sounds are a bit diminished in the lower lobes, but I'll need to listen again after you take deeper breaths. Blood pressure is 142/92. A little on the higher side. Now, could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Arms? Fine. Hurry up. What are you looking for? I've always had strong hands. From the metal, you know. It's hard work.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is good, but there is some tenderness to palpation on the dorsal side of both wrists. Some slight swelling present as well. Range of motion is slightly limited with pain on extension. Now, if you wouldn’t mind standing up, I'd like to quickly assess your back.
PATIENT: Back? Oh, for goodness sake. What are you even looking for? I told you, it aches sometimes. It's just old age creeping in. Metal work is hard on the body.
DOCTOR: There’s some muscle tenderness along the lumbar spine. Range of motion is limited with pain on forward bending. No obvious signs of asymmetry. Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for letting me conduct that exam. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early symptoms of osteoarthritis, potentially exacerbated by the repetitive movements of your work. Your blood pressure is also slightly elevated, which we need to monitor.
PATIENT: Osteo… what? What does that even mean? And my blood pressure? I feel fine! Just tired sometimes. It’s just the work. I’ve been doing it for years. You’re making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Fontanazza. It's natural to feel that way. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition – basically, wear and tear on the joints. The repetitive motions of metalwork can certainly contribute to that. It can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion, like you're experiencing in your wrists and back. And elevated blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to more serious health problems down the line. However, we don't need to jump to conclusions. I'd like to order some blood work and an X-ray of your wrists and lower back to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I have work, you know. Is it really necessary? I feel fine most of the time. Maybe just a little tired. My husband… he's probably going to want to come with me. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time commitment, Ms. Fontanazza. We can discuss payment options and try to schedule the tests at a time that’s convenient for you. The blood work will help rule out other potential causes of your fatigue and pain, and the X-ray will allow us to visualize the condition of your joints and confirm whether osteoarthritis is present. It’s a standard procedure for evaluating these symptoms. I also understand your husband may want to come. He's welcome to join you for any appointments. For now, I’m going to recommend that you try to avoid heavy lifting and repetitive movements as much as possible, and consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. But it’s important to get these tests done to make sure we're addressing the underlying cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But I’m telling you, it's just the work. Schedule it… whatever. But not too early. I need to sleep. And make sure it doesn't cost too much. My husband will be very angry if it does.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m scheduling the blood work for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and the X-ray for Wednesday at 1:30 PM. The clinic staff will provide you with information regarding the costs and insurance coverage. They can also discuss payment plans if needed. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… hurry up and get me out of here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for coming in today. I’ll see you next week. Please let the receptionist know if you have any questions before you leave. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
