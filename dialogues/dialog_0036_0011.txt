DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, somethin' about... a little touch-up. My nephew said somethin' 'bout clearin' me for it. Don't recall the specifics, truthfully. Just want it done quick-like.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I see here you’re requesting medical clearance for a tattoo. I understand you’re short on time, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. However, even for a simple clearance, I need to ask a few questions to make sure it’s safe for you to proceed. It's standard procedure, and it helps protect your health. First, can you tell me a little more about this “touch-up”?
PATIENT: "Touch-up." That's what the young man called it. It's a picture. On my arm. Gettin' it… freshened up. Been there a while, see? It's just… losin' its color, that's all. Don't need a history lesson about it, though. Just tell me if I can get the paper signed or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It is a bit faded. Now, to be thorough, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you had any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Look, I'm 64 years old. Everything changes. What kinda question is that? I ain’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I feel alright. A little achy, maybe, but who isn't? I mostly just keep to myself. Don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: I understand you haven’t been to a doctor recently, and that’s alright. I just need to cover some basics. "A little achy" can mean a lot of things. Where are you feeling the aches most?
PATIENT: Everywhere! My back, my knees… sometimes my hands. It comes and goes. Old age, I tell ya. It ain't nothin' serious. Look, I install towers, see? Cellular stuff. It's hard work. Always climbin' and liftin'. That's why I'm achy. But it don't affect my gettin' a picture touched up, does it? Just wanna know if I can do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tower installation. That is physically demanding work. And you're right, aches and pains are common with that line of work. Just to be sure, have you noticed any swelling or redness around your joints, or any stiffness that lasts for more than a few minutes in the morning?
PATIENT: Swelling? Redness? I ain't payin' attention to my joints, lady! I'm tryin' to get a paper signed! Look, I ain't sick. I just want to get somethin' done. This is ridiculous. You askin' me like I'm fallin' apart. I’ve been doin’ this work for decades! I'm strong, I tell ya. Strong! Just… sign the paper. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions seem excessive. However, it's my responsibility to ensure your safety. Even a seemingly minor procedure like a tattoo can introduce risks, and it’s important to rule out any underlying conditions that might make it unsafe for you. Given your description of aches and pains, and the physical demands of your job, I'd like to briefly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: You're tellin' me about responsibility? I been climbin' those towers longer than you been alive, young lady! I don't need you checkin' my blood pressure. I know my body. And frankly, I find your line of questionin'… condescendin'. I came here for a simple clearance, not a full physical exam. Look, I ain’t got time for this. I'm leavin'. Find somebody else to bother. And keep your hands to yourself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I respect your decision. However, I must advise you that proceeding with a tattoo without a proper assessment could potentially be harmful to your health. I understand you're frustrated, but my priority is your wellbeing. I'm unable to sign the clearance form without a basic medical check. I can offer you a list of free or low-cost clinics in the area if you would like, where you may be able to receive the assessment you need. I wish you the best. .
