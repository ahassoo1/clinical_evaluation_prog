DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Croonquist, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Croonquist. Look, I just need the lab work, if that's alright. Don't really have time for a long chat, you know? Things… things are happening.
DOCTOR: “Things are happening.” Right. Well, even with “things happening” we still need to go through the motions, sir. It’s… policy. And frankly, it's just good medicine. What “things” are happening that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really remember. Something… something the doctor said. Routine check-up, maybe? I get a lot of those. Medicare insists, I think. It's all a bit of a blur, to be frank. Just need the tests, and then I can get going. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: A blur, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit of one. Look, I used to work at the power plant, you know? Lots of… numbers and dials and things. Maybe that scrambled my brain a bit. Not sure. Just… old age, probably. Can we just get to the lab work? I really appreciate it. It's a long drive back.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s see… you had some blood work done on July 15th. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, lipid panel… standard stuff. Everything seems within normal limits, though I suppose “normal” is relative at your age. Anything specific worry you?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. But that's just getting old, right? Look, I don't want to bother you with details. I just need a copy of those results. Can I get that and be on my way? I have… appointments. Lots of them.
DOCTOR: "Tired." Right. And how long have you been feeling "tired"?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A while. Months, probably. Honestly, it's hard to say. Time just… slips away, you know? I wake up, I do things, I go to sleep. It all blends together. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to be going soon. I’m starting to forget why I'm even here… which is a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Medications… um… I think… maybe something for my blood pressure? The little white pills. But honestly, I don't remember the doctor telling me what for, or how many to take. My daughter usually handles all that. I just… take them. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. “Little white pills.” And do you know the dosage of these “little white pills”?
PATIENT: Dosage? Oh dear. No, I really don’t. I just take what’s in the bottle. My daughter fills it. She's very organized. I’m… not so much. Look, I apologize for being a bother. It's just… my memory isn't what it used to be. Can we just skip this part and get to the results? I’d really appreciate it. It's a long drive, and I’m starting to feel a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Fine. We'll skip it. But understand, this is… less than ideal. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? I eat… sometimes. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but then again, I always have. I'm a tall guy, you see, always been thin. It’s probably nothing. Just… old age again. Look, really, if the tests came back okay, can I just have a copy? I'm starting to feel quite faint. And I really can't remember what I had for breakfast. Which is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be sure. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It'll be fast. Take a deep breath… and another… and another.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just trying to… breathe. It's a bit harder than it used to be, you know? But I used to work at the power plant, lots of dust and fumes… probably messed things up a bit. Just hurry it along, if you could. I really need to be going… honestly, I’m starting to forget where I’m going. It’s all a bit of a blur. .
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Lungs sound a little… diminished, but that's not uncommon for your age. Now, stand up for me. Let’s check your gait. Hmm. Slightly unsteady. Do you use any assistive devices – a cane, a walker, anything like that?
