DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, I just... wanted to check things out. Been feelin' okay, mostly. Just curious, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before this. Thought I should probably start.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good idea, Demondre. Preventative care is important. “Feelin’ okay” is a good starting point, but can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I work on the boats, mostly. Keepin' the engines runnin' smooth, that kinda stuff. It's good work, keeps me busy. No real problems with the work, just... long hours sometimes. I sleep okay, eat okay, I guess. Nothing fancy. I just... wanna make sure everything is okay, even if it feels like it is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Demondre. Long hours can definitely take a toll, even if you feel generally well. So, you're saying you don't have any specific complaints, you just want a general check-up?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. No pain, no nothin'. Just... a check-up. Like gettin' the boat checked, you know? Make sure nothin' is about to break down before it does break down. If that makes sense. Is that... normal? People do that?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and yes, people definitely do that! We call it a preventative exam. It's a good way to catch things early. Okay, so no specific pain, no fever, no cough, no recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope. No fever, no cough... I had a little cold last winter, but that was it. And it didn’t last long. Just a sniffle and a sore throat for a couple days. Nothing major. I mostly just try to stay outta the cold when I can. This job keeps me movin' though, so I don't usually get too sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's go over a quick review of systems just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I think I’m pretty steady. Maybe lost a pound or two over the winter, but nothin’ I worried about. I eat pretty much the same, work pretty much the same. I’m usually around the same weight. I don't really step on a scale much, to be honest. Just feel about the same.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any problems with your sleep – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling tired during the day even after a good night's rest?
PATIENT: Nope. Sleep pretty good, actually. When I’m tired, I sleep. No tossin’ and turnin’, no wakin’ up in the middle of the night. Maybe sometimes a little slow to get goin' in the mornin’, but that’s just ‘cause it’s early. I usually get a good 7, 8 hours, somethin’ like that. Work tires me out, so I sleep good.
DOCTOR: Good. Any changes in your bowel habits or appetite?
PATIENT: Uh, no. Everything's regular, if you know what I mean. And I eat okay. Not a huge eater, but I get enough. I like my food. No change in what I want to eat, or how much. Just normal. I eat when I'm hungry, and I don't really worry about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any recent injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries ever. I've scraped my knee a couple times workin' on the boat, but nothin' serious. Just a little band-aid kinda stuff. Nothing that needed a doctor. I’m pretty careful, usually. You gotta be when you’re around engines and stuff. Mostly just bumps and bruises. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache now and then, but that's it. Never had a reaction to anything. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Does food allergies count? I eat pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: No, food allergies don’t sound like a concern right now. And ibuprofen is fine. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… the air, I guess? I don't take nothin'. Never really been one for pills and stuff. I try to eat good, get enough sleep, that kinda thing. Never needed anything else. I don't take vitamins or nothin’ like that. Just... me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, Demondre, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be cold or somethin’. I don't like cold stuff in my ears.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Good. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds regular. Ears look clear as well. No signs of infection. Now I’m going to take a look at your throat. Say “Ahhh.” Throat looks good, no redness or swelling. Everything looks normal so far. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes now. Lymph nodes are normal size, no swelling. Overall, your physical exam appears normal. Now, to get a better baseline of your health, I’d like to order some routine blood work. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. "Ahhh." Blood work sounds fine too. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just... let me know if it’s gonna be a lot of needles or somethin’. I don’t love needles.
DOCTOR: It’s just a standard blood draw, Demondre. A few vials, and it will be over before you know it. It helps us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other important levels. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the order sent over there, and they can take care of you. It's pretty quick, and the phlebotomist is very good. Do you have any questions about the blood work before we proceed?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I’m good. Just… a few vials, you said? Not a whole lot? Okay. Sounds alright. I guess I'll head down the hall then. Is there anything I need to do before the blood work? Like, not eat for a while, or somethin'?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to fast. Just drink plenty of water beforehand. The lab will give you specific instructions if needed, but generally, you can eat and drink normally. Here’s a printout with the lab’s location and contact information. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Water, got it. A week, that’s fine. Nah, I think that’s all the questions I got. You explained everything pretty clear. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. I appreciate you takin' the time to check me out, even if nothin’ was wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. That’s what we’re here for. It's always a good idea to establish a baseline for your health. Feel free to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and try to stay safe out there on the boats!
