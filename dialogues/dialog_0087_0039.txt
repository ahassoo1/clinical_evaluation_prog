DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, a nurse – a very nice young woman – called me and said some blood work showed my cholesterol was a bit high. I don't really understand all that stuff, to be honest. She thought I should come in and talk about it. It's just… I feel fine, you know? I’ve been feeling pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good that you're feeling well. It's not uncommon for cholesterol levels to fluctuate, and often we can address them with some simple lifestyle changes. Do you have a copy of those blood work results with you today, or did the nurse just give you a general overview?
PATIENT: No, I don't have a copy with me. She just told me over the phone that it was "high cholesterol" and that I should get it checked out. She was very polite, but I didn't really press her for numbers or anything. I figured you'd have all that information here. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, truth be told. Everything's usually been alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see the results here from July 28th. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that’s the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. These numbers are a little elevated, as the nurse mentioned. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… They all sort of swim together. Well, medical history… Let's see. I was a pretty healthy kid, actually. Had all my shots, of course. Nothing serious ever, thank the Lord. When I was younger, I worked pretty hard, you know? First-Line Supervisor...lots of time on my feet. I had a bit of a scare with my heart maybe fifteen years ago, but they said it was just some irregular heartbeat. Nothing needed surgery or anything, just some pills for a while. My wife, bless her soul, she passed away five years ago. That was… hard. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being an old man, I suppose. I’ve always tried to stay active, though. Still do a bit of gardening.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bohnett. It's good to know you've been generally healthy. The irregular heartbeat fifteen years ago – do you remember what medication you were on for that, and are you still taking it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was a little white pill, I think. Small, you know? I had to take one every day. I can’t recall the name of it for the life of me. My wife was always good with remembering names, but… well. And no, I haven’t taken it in years. The doctor at the time said I didn’t need it anymore. He said the episodes had stopped and it wasn't bothering me, so he took me off of it. I remember being relieved to not have to take another pill, to be honest. I’ve never been one for taking medicine unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Okay, so no current medications then. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about everything, though I try to watch my salt. My wife used to say I put salt on everything, so I've toned it down a bit since she passed. Mostly I eat pretty simple food, really. Nothing fancy. I don't go in for those newfangled things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it wasn't a pretty sight. I always said I'd stay far away from them. And I don’t drink much, either. A glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a month. Nothing more than that. Always figured moderation was the key to a long life.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Bohnett. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any heart problems, high cholesterol, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… my father had a heart attack when he was about 70, I think. It was a long time ago. He didn't take care of himself like he should have, always eating rich foods and not much exercise. My mother, she lived to be 92, and she was pretty healthy, all things considered. I don’t recall any stroke or diabetes on her side. My brother, he had high blood pressure, but that was it, as far as I know. We didn’t talk much after we got older, you see. And my grandparents… well, I didn’t know them very well. They passed away when I was just a boy. It was a different time back then. People didn't talk about these things as much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for that information. Now, before we discuss a plan, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a long time, so I’m sure I’m overdue. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take slow, deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a bit fast, 88 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. That’s a little elevated. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear as well. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes, and feel your pulses in your extremities. Reflexes are normal, and pulses are good. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the elevated blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? My blood pressure has been a little high lately, I suppose. I get a bit anxious sometimes, especially since my wife passed. It probably contributes. I tend to worry a bit too much, I suppose. Still, I feel alright. I’m still active, still gardening. I just want to stay healthy, you know? For as long as I can. What do you think we should do about the cholesterol, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be proactive, Mr. Bohnett. Feeling well is excellent, but the cholesterol numbers and elevated blood pressure do need to be addressed. Given your age and family history, we want to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. The first step I recommend is lifestyle modifications. This includes a heart-healthy diet – lower in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium – regular exercise, and stress management. We can discuss some resources for healthy eating and exercise programs if you’re interested. Regarding the stress, you mentioned anxiety after your wife’s passing, which is perfectly understandable. Have you considered any support groups or counseling?
PATIENT: That all sounds sensible, Doctor. A healthier diet...I could probably work on that. I do enjoy my comfort foods, I admit. And more exercise wouldn’t hurt. The gardening keeps me moving, but maybe I need to be more… deliberate about it. As for the stress… well, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. It's just… hard, you know? Five years is a long time, but I still miss her terribly. I get by. I keep busy. I didn’t want to bother anyone with my troubles. I figured it was just something I had to live with. But maybe… maybe talking to someone would help. Do you know of anyone local? Someone who understands?
DOCTOR: It takes courage to admit you need support, Mr. Bohnett, and it’s absolutely not bothering anyone. Grief is a complex process, and it’s healthy to seek help when you need it. I have a list here of local therapists and support groups specializing in grief counseling. Several of them offer individual and group sessions. I can give you the list, and you can choose someone you feel comfortable with. Now, let’s discuss the cholesterol. I’d like to repeat the blood work in three months to see if lifestyle changes are making a difference. If the numbers haven’t improved sufficiently, we can discuss the possibility of medication. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Repeating the blood work and seeing if I can lower it with diet and exercise is a good place to start. I’d rather not take any pills if I can avoid it. And yes, please, I’d appreciate the list of therapists and support groups. It might do me some good to talk to someone who understands what I’m going through. It’s just… lonely sometimes, you know? Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind and patient with an old man like me. I feel a bit better already, just knowing there are options.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It's my job to help you feel your best, and you're not an "old man" at all. You’re proactive and engaged in your health, and that’s wonderful. Here is the list of local resources. I’ll also print out some information on heart-healthy diets. And I’ll send the order to the lab for a repeat cholesterol panel in three months. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I suppose I should get going. Thank you again, Doctor Soodeen. You’ve given me a bit of hope, and that's a precious thing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. .
