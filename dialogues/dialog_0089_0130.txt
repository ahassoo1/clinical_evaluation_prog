DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother, she had something… not cancer, but bad sickness too. I just… I want to make sure I am okay. You know? Just peace of mind. I’m not feeling sick, but… it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It's good you’re thinking about this. Let’s talk through things and get a good picture of your overall health. To start, can you tell me a little more about your sister’s and mother’s illnesses?
PATIENT: My sister… she had it in her… her chest. Lung cancer, the doctors said. It happened fast. Real fast. She… she smoked for a long time. And my mother… it was her stomach. Always hurting. They did… tests. Lots of tests. I don’t remember what it was called, just… bad stomach. She had it for many years before… before she passed. It wasn’t quick like my sister. Just… slow getting worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's understandable why you’d be concerned. Knowing the type of cancer your sister had, and that your mother had stomach issues, is helpful. Just to clarify, do you know the specific type of stomach problem your mother had?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Like I said, lots of tests, but the doctors used… big words. I didn’t understand. She just always complained about her stomach. And she took pills. Many pills. That’s all I really know. I was young, and… well, my father, he handled the doctor stuff. He didn't talk much about it either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common not to remember everything, especially if you were younger at the time. We don’t need to dwell on that. Let’s focus on you now. You mentioned you aren’t feeling sick at the moment, which is great. But just to be thorough, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe… a little tired sometimes. But I'm old! Old people get tired. I work, you know? Sales. Traveling around. It's a tiring job. Nothing… nothing wrong, I don't think. No pain, no… nothing like that. I eat okay, I guess. Nothing fancy. I drink… a little beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. And you're right, a little fatigue is common as we get older, especially with a demanding job like sales. Still, it’s good you mentioned it. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any significant medical problems yourself in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a boy. Playing. That's about it. And… I had the flu a few times. Nothing… serious. I go to the doctor for a check-up every year, but they always say I’m okay. Blood pressure’s a little high, they said once, but it’s not bad. They gave me pills for that too, but I don’t always take them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child, the flu, and some occasional high blood pressure that you've been given medication for. That's helpful to know. And you said you don't always take the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yeah. Sometimes I forget. And sometimes… I just don't feel like it. I feel fine, you know? And the pills… they make me a little… dizzy. So I skip them sometimes. Maybe I should take them more, but… it’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to stay on top of medications, especially if you’re not experiencing symptoms. And it’s good you’re aware of the side effect of dizziness. We can certainly discuss strategies to help you remember, or explore other options if the side effects are bothersome. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat anything. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish. But I'm divorced now, so… that doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, when I remember. And sometimes… sometimes I take something for my back. It hurts after a long day of traveling. It's… an ointment. You rub it on. I buy it at the drugstore. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication intermittently and a topical ointment for your back. Good. Now, would you mind if I took a quick look at your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature?
PATIENT: No, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just trying to make sure I'm okay. Like my sister and mother…
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. We will get this done quickly. "Let's get his blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and oxygen saturation, please." Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. Your pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and your oxygen saturation is 99%. Not too concerning, but something we should discuss. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower right quadrant. Do you experience any pain or discomfort there regularly?
PATIENT: Tender? Lower right? Hmm… sometimes. Not pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache. After I’ve been driving all day. Or if I… if I lift something heavy. I thought it was just my back. Old age, you know? Maybe I pulled something. I haven’t told a doctor about it. Never bothered me enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. A dull ache in the lower right abdomen after driving or lifting. We need to explore that a little further. Now, I want to ask about your family history in a bit more detail, beyond your sister and mother. Did any other close relatives have cancer or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my grandfather on my mother’s side… he had something with his… his intestines. Real sick. He was very old when he died. And… my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had diabetes. She lost a leg. That was… sad. Everyone said it was because she was overweight. Other than that… not that I remember. My father’s side… I didn’t know them very well. He didn't talk about them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your maternal grandfather had an intestinal illness, and your maternal aunt had diabetes. Good to know. And your paternal family history is limited. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never liked it. My sister… she started when she was young. Tried to get me to try, but I said no. Always thought it was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a little beer sometimes. After work. Maybe two or three on a Friday night. Not every Friday, mind you. Just when I’m… stressed. Or tired. Nothing fancy. I don't drink hard liquor.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer consumption. And finally, do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Not really. My job… traveling, walking around at sales meetings… that’s about it. I don't go to the gym. Never been a gym person. Used to play soccer when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Mostly just… sitting in the car.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily a sedentary lifestyle with some walking related to your job. Mr. Schwer, given your family history, your slightly elevated blood pressure, the occasional abdominal discomfort, and your lifestyle, I think it's prudent to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be agreeable to a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a urinalysis?
PATIENT: Tests? Um… I guess so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I want to know I'm okay. Like my sister and mother… I don't want… you know. What kind of tests are they? Will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s good you want to be proactive. No, none of these tests will hurt. The complete blood count is a simple blood draw that checks your red and white blood cell counts, which can help detect infection or other abnormalities. The comprehensive metabolic panel is another blood draw that assesses your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. The urinalysis is just a urine sample – we’ll ask you to provide that in a private room. These tests will give us a baseline of your overall health and help us rule out any potential issues. We can also discuss a possible abdominal ultrasound to investigate the source of your discomfort, if you’re comfortable with that. It uses sound waves to create images of your organs, and it’s painless. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Sounds… scary. But if you think it’s important… okay. Whatever you need. I just… I want to know I’m okay. So yes. Do the tests. All of them. And… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Mr. Schwer. I understand your apprehension, but an ultrasound will provide us with valuable information. The lab results and the ultrasound images usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings in detail. We’ll go over everything together, and I’ll explain what they mean. In the meantime, I’m going to write an order for these tests, and the nurse will help you schedule the appropriate appointments. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for… for doing the tests. It makes me feel… better, knowing you’re looking into it. It’s just… scary, you know? My sister…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I completely understand. It is scary, and you're right to be proactive about your health. My goal is to get you the answers you need and provide you with the best possible care. The nurse will be in shortly to discuss scheduling. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I guess I'll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It was my pleasure. And please, try not to worry too much until we have the results. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
