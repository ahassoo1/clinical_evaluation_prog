DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s what my sister told me to come in for. She worries somethin’ awful. I don’t always feel bad, but she said I oughta get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s perfectly fine. It’s good your sister is looking out for you. High blood pressure often doesn't have obvious symptoms, so it's smart to get it checked. Can you tell me a little more about what your sister means by "actin' up"?
PATIENT: Well, she said I been more tired than usual, I guess. And sometimes my head feels kinda…full? Not a headache exactly, just…heavy. Mostly she just noticed I wasn’t movin’ as fast as I used to around the kitchen. I bake a lot, you see. Keeps me busy. And she said my face looked puffy sometimes. I don’t really notice it myself, but she’s got sharp eyes.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Venna. Fatigue, that feeling of heaviness in your head, and your sister noticing puffiness – those can all be related to blood pressure. Do you know if your blood pressure has ever been checked before?
PATIENT: Hmm…I think so. Maybe at the hospital once when I broke my wrist a few years back? But I don't rightly remember the numbers or anything. I don't go to doctors much, unless somethin's really broke. It usually just goes away on its own, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A lot of people don't see the doctor unless they're feeling quite unwell. It’s good you came in now, though. Okay, let’s get a better idea of what’s going on. I'd like to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll ask you a few more questions about your health history, if that's alright with you. Is there anything you’re particularly worried about?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Just get it over with quick, if you could. I got a pie crust needin’ rolled later. Not too worried, mostly just want to know if it’s somethin' serious. I'm a simple woman.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. We’ll be as quick as we can. I respect that you're a simple woman, and I'll explain everything clearly. First, let's take your blood pressure. I'll need you to sit still and relaxed for a few minutes. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your blood pressure is 162/94. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation otherwise. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is that bad? 162/94...My sister always said I ate too much salt. No, nothin' like that. Just the broken wrist, like I said. And arthritis in my hands, but that’s just old age. Doc always said it was just wear and tear. I try to ignore it as much as I can. I eat pretty regular, I guess. Not fancy, mostly just what I bake. And vegetables from my garden when they’re in season.
DOCTOR: It’s good you have a garden, Venna, fresh vegetables are wonderful. 162/94 is elevated, and we'll want to address that. It’s not an emergency at this moment, but it does need attention to prevent bigger problems down the road. Your sister is right to be concerned about salt intake – it can definitely play a role. And the arthritis is good to know. Does the arthritis cause you any pain or limit your ability to do things, like baking?
PATIENT: Well, my hands ache somethin’ fierce in the mornings, and when it rains. Makes rollin’ the dough a little harder, and I drop things more. I used to decorate cakes real fancy, with roses and all, but I don’t do much of that anymore. Too much trouble. I mostly stick to pies now. Easier on the hands, you see. And folks always need a good pie.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, simpler is often better. It’s good you’ve adapted and found ways to keep doing what you enjoy. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone else in your family has high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mama had a weak heart, I think. She got real tired easy, and she passed when she was fairly young. But she didn’t go to doctors much either, just like me. And my brother, Earl, he had some kinda trouble with his kidneys, but I don’t rightly remember the details. He lived out west and we didn’t see each other much after we were grown. No one else that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A family history of heart problems and kidney issues is good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some arthritis cream, the kind you rub on your hands. And sometimes I take a little something for sleep if I'm tossin’ and turnin’. Mostly just when I got a lot on my mind. It’s one of those… the purple box, I think? I can’t remember the name right now. It don’t really do much, but it helps me feel like I’m doin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. The arthritis cream and the sleep aid. Do you know the dosage of the sleep aid you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, land, no. I just take one or two before bed, depending on how restless I am. It's one of those little pills, and I usually just throw the box away when it's empty. I don't keep track of things like that. I don't have a good memory for numbers, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Venna. Many people don’t remember exact dosages. We can look up some common sleep aids later to get a better idea of what you might be taking. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to nothin’. I used to help my mama with her garden, and we had all sorts of plants and berries. Never had a problem with pollen or nothin’. I think I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Venna. No known allergies. Okay, I think I have a pretty good picture of what's going on. Based on what you’ve told me, your elevated blood pressure, family history, and your lifestyle, I suspect you have hypertension – high blood pressure. It's very common, especially as we get older. We need to confirm this with some additional testing. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. I’d also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, dear. I don’t like tests. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose it’s better to know, right? As long as it don’t take too long. I got that pie crust… I guess we can do the tests. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I understand your hesitation. We'll make it as quick and easy as possible. The blood work will just involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. The EKG is painless – we’ll put some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It only takes a few minutes. The nurse will take care of the blood work and the EKG right here in the clinic. Then we'll send the results to the lab, and I'll review them as soon as they're available. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend making a few lifestyle changes. Reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise can all help lower your blood pressure. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. I also want you to keep a log of your blood pressure at home. You can get a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Check your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – and write down the readings. Bring the log with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Salt, walkin', and writin' things down... Seems like a lot. I ain't much for writin', Doctor. My hands get tired too quick. And I mostly stand when I'm bakin', so I guess I get enough walkin'. What about… medicine? Will I have to take medicine? That's what I'm really worried about. I don’t like takin’ pills.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Venna. Many people feel the same way about taking medication. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I always try to start with lifestyle changes first. Often, those are enough to manage high blood pressure, especially if it’s caught early. Once we get the results of your tests, we'll have a better idea of how high your blood pressure is and whether you might benefit from medication. If you do need medication, we can discuss the different options and find one that's right for you. There are many different types available, and some have fewer side effects than others. We can also work together to find ways to make the lifestyle changes easier. For example, you don't have to write down your blood pressure readings – maybe your sister could help you with that. And we can find other ways to get you moving if walking is difficult. My goal is to work with you to find a solution that keeps you healthy and comfortable. We won’t do anything you're not comfortable with. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds…better. My sister would help with the writin', I reckon. She's always tryin' to boss me around anyway. And I guess I can try to walk a little more, if it'll help. As long as I don't have to take a whole mess of pills… Alright, Doctor. Let's get these tests done, then. Get it over with, and see what we need to do. And thank you for explainin' it all so nice. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. That’s my job. And you're a good patient, asking good questions. Alright, I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and do the EKG. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Then you can go home and relax, and we’ll call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time. .
