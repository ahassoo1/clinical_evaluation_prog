DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Asami. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today because I am hoping to be cleared to move into a senior living facility. It is a bit of a big step for an old man, but I believe it is time.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Tkac. It takes courage to make a change like that, and it sounds like you've given it a lot of thought. I’m happy to help in any way I can to facilitate that process. A pre-placement physical is exactly what we need to do. Before we get started, do you have any existing medical records we can take a look at, or are you comfortable just telling me about your medical history?
PATIENT: That is very kind of you to say, Doctor. I do have some records, yes. I saw Doctor Miller for a number of years back in Rapid City, but I haven't been to a doctor regularly for… well, a few years now, to be honest. I can tell you what I remember, and I do remember quite a bit. Would that be alright? Perhaps we could look for those records later, if needed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Tkac. Your recollections are incredibly valuable, and we can certainly supplement with records if we feel it's necessary. Let’s start with what you remember. To give me a good picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had the measles as a boy, like most children did back then. Nothing serious. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree – a very foolish thing to do. As I got older, I developed some arthritis in my knees and hips, which is to be expected, I suppose, with a lifetime of work. I used to bake a lot of bread, you see. Lots of standing. Doctor Miller gave me some medication for it, which helped for a time. No surgeries, thankfully. I also had pneumonia once, but recovered well. Oh, and a touch of the flu every now and then, like everyone else. Is there anything specific you’d like me to focus on? I don’t want to bore you with details you don't need.
DOCTOR: No, that's a very helpful overview, Mr. Tkac, thank you. Knowing what you've experienced, even seemingly minor things, is important. You mentioned arthritis in your knees and hips. Is that arthritis still bothering you currently?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, Doctor. It hasn’t gone away, not entirely. Some days are better than others, naturally. When the weather is damp, it aches something fierce. And standing for long periods, like I used to do with the baking, is… difficult now. I get around alright, but I do take things slower. I use a cane most of the time, just to be safe. I wouldn’t want to take a tumble.
DOCTOR: I understand. A cane is a wise precaution. And the weather sensitivity is very common with arthritis. Now, outside of the arthritis, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently – anything at all that's been bothering you, like shortness of breath, chest pain, changes in your weight or appetite, or any problems with your vision, hearing, or digestion?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, Doctor, thankfully. My chest feels fine. My appetite is… perhaps a little smaller than it used to be, but I still enjoy a good meal when I can. I’ve lost a little weight, I suppose, mostly just from getting older. And my hearing isn’t what it used to be, but that’s hardly a surprise. I have to ask people to speak up sometimes. Vision is alright, though I do wear glasses for reading. Digestion… well, old age does bring its own little troubles in that department, but nothing that causes me much concern. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Tkac. You're doing a wonderful job being thorough. It’s good you're aware of these changes. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take a low dose of ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s particularly bad. Doctor Miller prescribed it. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things regular. Nothing else, really. Just the ibuprofen and the multivitamin. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but Doctor Miller took me off of it a few years ago. Said it had come down on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. And that's helpful information about having been on blood pressure medication previously. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My mother, God rest her soul, had diabetes. She struggled with it for many years. My father was a strong man, but he did have a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my older sister, she passed away from cancer a few years back. Lung cancer, I believe it was. I have one brother still living, and he seems to be in good health, as far as I know. He lives out in California. I don’t see him often. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? I try to remember what I can. It's been a long time, you understand.
DOCTOR: You're providing very helpful information, Mr. Tkac. Knowing about the diabetes, heart disease, and cancer in your family is important. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Have you ever smoked cigarettes or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always warned me about them, and I heeded her advice. Always preferred fresh air, myself. And I've always been around baking, so the smell of tobacco wasn't particularly appealing.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Tkac. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, especially when I was younger. A small glass, nothing excessive. But I haven't had a drink in several years now. Didn’t really care for it much, to be honest. It just didn't agree with me. I preferred a cup of tea, myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine in the past, but none currently. And tea is a good choice! Now, before we get to the physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've always been able to eat whatever was put in front of me, thankfully. And I haven’t had any trouble with medications either. It's one of the few blessings an old man has, I suppose - not having to worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Tkac. Alright, if you’re comfortable, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears and throat, and just do a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I've always believed a good doctor knows what they're doing. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Rate is 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, good breath sounds. Ears are clear, mild age-related changes in your throat, but nothing concerning. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age, but symmetrical. Balance is good, with a slight wobble, but nothing alarming. Overall, the exam is within normal limits for your age, with slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes, which are not unexpected. Now, do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds quite reasonable to me. Diminished reflexes and a wobble... well, I am an old man, after all. I wouldn't expect to be as spry as I once was. Slightly elevated blood pressure... is that something we should be concerned about? Should I be cutting back on my tea?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Tkac. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to monitor. It’s not dramatically high, and it could be a little bit of “white coat hypertension” – meaning it’s elevated here in the doctor’s office because you’re a little anxious. But we'll keep an eye on it. Cutting back on your tea is not necessarily required at this point, but we can certainly discuss some lifestyle modifications – like ensuring a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise – that can help manage your blood pressure. It’s more about making small, sustainable changes rather than drastic cuts. To get a better baseline, I'd like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible to me. Blood work is a good idea. It’s always best to be thorough, as you say. And I'm happy to make some small changes if it will help. I suppose a little more walking wouldn't hurt. And I can certainly try to be mindful of the salt. I do enjoy a good pickle now and then, though. As for the pickle... is there anything I should be doing now, before the blood work, to make things easier? And when do you think I'd have the results?
DOCTOR: A good pickle is a hard thing to give up, Mr. Tkac, I understand! No, there’s nothing specific you need to do before the blood work. Just try to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can still drink water. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to send them over. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, to circle back to your original reason for being here – the pre-placement physical for the senior living facility – do they have any specific requirements or forms I need to fill out?
PATIENT: That is very considerate of you to ask, Doctor. Yes, they do. The facility has a form they need completed by a physician, detailing my overall health status and any limitations I might have. The nurse at the facility, Sarah, emailed it to me. I believe it is on my tablet. Would you prefer I retrieve it now, or would it be easier if I sent it to your office electronically? I am fairly adept with this new technology, though my brother might disagree.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Tkac. Either way works perfectly. If it’s easier for you, you can email it to the office at [office email address]. Or, if you’d prefer, you can retrieve it now, and we can take a look while we wait for the blood work results. We can also scan it and send it to your email for your records. Since we're waiting a few days for the blood work, there’s no rush. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: I think it would be best if I sent it electronically. That way, you have it right away, and I don’t have to worry about misplacing it. And I can keep a copy for myself, of course. I'll send it over right now. It shouldn't take me more than a minute. And thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient and thorough. It's reassuring to know someone is looking out for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It’s my pleasure. And don't worry, looking out for you is what I'm here for. While we're waiting for the email, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. I'm quite satisfied with our discussion. I'll just send over the form, and we'll await the results of the blood work. And I suppose I should mention one small thing... I do have a bit of trouble remembering names. So, if I forget your name, please don't take offense. It's just the way my brain works these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tkac. It happens to the best of us! My name is Dr. Asami, and I promise I won't be offended if you forget. Alright, then. I'll keep an eye out for the email. In the meantime, feel free to relax, and let me know if you need anything at all. We'll be in touch soon. .
