DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Skarbek, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that’s right. Karry Skarbek. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Batara, is it? I apologize if I don’t shake your hand, my bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Batara is correct. And don't bother with formalities. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. I’m here about gettin’ some shots. My niece… she’s tryin’ to come visit from over in Ireland, and I believe she needs some vaccinations to get a visa, or maybe to even enter the country. I’m not entirely sure what’s required, to be honest, and I thought it best to ask someone who knows. She's a good girl, just wants to see her old uncle.
DOCTOR: So, you want me to vaccinate someone based on…a visit?
PATIENT: Oh, no, ma’am, not at all! I don’t need you to vaccinate her directly. I just need to know what vaccinations she’ll need. I want to be sure she has everything taken care of before she comes, so she doesn't have trouble gettin’ in. I can take her to my doctor, of course, but I don't know what to ask for, see? It’s all a bit confusing. I apologize for the misunderstanding. I’m just tryin’ to be a good uncle.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the requirements are constantly changing. And frankly, people should be up-to-date on their vaccinations regardless of travel. Has she had her routine immunizations?
PATIENT: That’s a good point, ma’am. I’m sure she had most of ‘em as a little girl, growin’ up, but that was… well, a long time ago. Ireland’s got its own healthcare system, and I don’t rightly know what they require over there, or what she’s had since then. I don’t think she’s had any boosters lately, if that’s what you mean. She's a healthy girl, though, works on a farm, so she's always outside.
DOCTOR: A farm, you say. That doesn’t necessarily mean she’s protected against everything. Tetanus is a concern with soil exposure, naturally. And depending on what animals she’s around… there's a lot to consider. Do you have any records of her vaccinations?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't. I asked her, but she said they keep those records over at the doctor’s office back in Ireland. She said it'd be a bit of a hassle to get ‘em sent over here. I was hopin’ you could maybe tell me a general list of what she should have, so I can ask her doctor when I talk to him next. I apologize for bein’ so… unhelpful. I’m not very good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to speculate about what someone should have. That's irresponsible. The CDC has guidelines, but without knowing her immunization history, it's just guesswork. She needs to find her records. If she can't, she will likely need a full series of vaccinations to comply with entry requirements. I can give you a list of what is typically recommended, but understand this is not a substitute for proper documentation.
PATIENT: I understand, ma’am. You’re right, of course. It just seemed like a lot of trouble for her to go through, and I was tryin’ to find an easier way. But I don’t want to be irresponsible, either. A list of what’s typically recommended would be a great help, though. Just so I know what to ask her doctor about. I appreciate your patience with me. I’m not used to dealin’ with these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Generally, for adults, we’re looking at Tdap – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and an annual influenza vaccine. She should also be up to date on MMR – measles, mumps, rubella – and varicella, chickenpox. Depending on her age and travel history, she may need others, like hepatitis A and B, and possibly even a pneumococcal vaccine. But again, this is general advice. And she’ll need to prove immunity or receive the vaccines before travel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, I think so. Tdap, flu, MMR, and chickenpox… and those others you mentioned, dependin’ on her age. And I need to get proof, or she needs to get the shots. That's a good list, thank you. I’ll write these down. Would it be alright if I asked you about where to find a good travel clinic, just in case she needs more than these basic ones?
DOCTOR: There's a clinic in Tulsa. They specialize in travel vaccinations. I don’t typically recommend specific clinics, but they are adequately equipped. Here's a card with their information. Don’t expect me to follow up on this. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't think so. That card is wonderful, thank you. You've been very helpful, even if you weren't very… warm. I appreciate your time, and your honesty. I’ll get her to get those records, and then we’ll go from there. Thank you again, Doctor Batara. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: See that she does. NEXT. .
