DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. It’s about my balance, I believe. It’s been…difficult. I feel unsteady on my feet, like I might fall. It’s hard to explain precisely when it started, truthfully. Things…blur a bit, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds concerning to feel unsteady like that. "Blur a bit"…can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes…well, it's not a sudden thing, not like a single event. More…fragments. I remember…working, certainly. The drill…the noise…but dates…times…they’re not…clear. It’s like looking at a photograph that’s been left in the sun for too long. The important parts are there, but faded. And the unsteadiness…it seems to come and go. Some days are better than others, but it's been…worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re experiencing some memory issues alongside this balance problem. It's good you're paying attention to that. And you mentioned it’s been worsening, but not a sudden onset. Just to clarify, when you say "the drill," what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes. I…operate a rotary drill. For oil and gas. It’s…physical work. A lot of…standing. And…noise. Quite a lot of noise, actually. It's…out in the fields, mostly. I’ve been doing it for…some time now. Though, precisely how long…that's one of the things that's…difficult to recall. I apologize. It feels foolish to not know.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly alright. We'll work through this together. It's helpful to know you do physically demanding work in a noisy environment. That gives us some clues. Let's talk about this unsteadiness a little more. Can you describe how it feels when you're unsteady?
PATIENT: Hmm…It's not…dizziness, not exactly. It's more like…my feet aren't quite there. Like they aren’t firmly planted. Or…like the ground is shifting, even when it isn’t. Sometimes it’s just a wobble, and I can correct it. Other times…it feels like I might fall, and I have to…really concentrate to stay upright. It happens when I'm walking, mostly. And…sometimes when I’m just standing still. It's… unsettling. And tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It doesn't sound like classic dizziness then. "Not firmly planted" and "ground shifting" – that gives me some ideas. Do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Hmm. I think… being tired definitely makes it worse. Long shifts, especially. And…if I haven’t eaten. That seems to affect it. The noise… I hadn't thought of it specifically, but perhaps it does. It’s…constant, you see. Always there. I suppose it could be…disorienting. It’s hard to say for certain. It's not like a simple cause and effect, it just…feels more pronounced when I’m already fatigued.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, low blood sugar, and potentially the constant noise. Good to know. Have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… That's…a good question. I haven't consciously noticed anything different. I wear glasses, you see, and I haven't needed a stronger prescription recently. But…with everything else…I suppose it’s possible I haven't noticed a subtle change. I work outdoors a lot, so bright sunlight is…common. Perhaps it’s something I’ve been…compensating for? I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's fair. We can check your vision quickly just to be sure. Besides the memory issues, balance problems and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been… rather… achy, actually. My joints, mostly. My knees and back. I assumed it was from the work, the standing and…the physical labor. It’s a dull ache, not sharp pain. And… I’ve been… a little more forgetful than usual, even aside from the larger memory issues. Losing things, forgetting appointments… small things. Nothing major, but… noticeable. It’s difficult to say if those are connected, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we've got joint aches and increased forgetfulness alongside the balance issues, fatigue and memory concerns. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, balance, and do a basic neurological assessment. And I'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I… I would like to understand what is happening, if possible. I apologize for being…unhelpful with the details. It is frustrating, not knowing.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to feel frustrated when you're not sure what's going on. We'll do our best to figure it out. Blood pressure is good, heart and lungs sound normal. Now, could you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes… I’m… standing with my eyes closed. It feels… precarious.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little on the slow side, but equal on both sides. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger. I’m… following it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your eye movements look normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your ears. Ears look clear. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, your symptoms – memory issues, balance problems, fatigue, joint aches – are concerning. The diminished reflexes and slight instability with your eyes closed suggest there may be a neurological component. It's difficult to say exactly what's going on without further investigation. I think we need to run some blood tests and possibly order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests… Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I want to know what is happening. I… I trust your judgment. It is just… unsettling, to think of something being…wrong. But I understand, if it is necessary to find out what is causing this. I… I will do whatever you recommend.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. I understand it’s unsettling. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests will help us rule out any vitamin deficiencies, infections, or other underlying medical conditions. The MRI will give us a more detailed look at your brain to see if there’s anything we need to investigate further. I’m going to order those tests now. The lab will draw blood, and we’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and ensure you're getting enough rest and proper nutrition. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Well… what are we looking for, specifically, with the MRI? Is there something you suspect? And… will these tests explain the memory loss? That is… perhaps the most concerning part, truthfully. It is frightening, not remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Lilyanna. With the MRI, we're looking for a number of things. It could be anything from small areas of inflammation or changes in brain structure to ruling out any larger issues. Given your symptoms, we'll be paying particular attention to areas of the brain that control balance, memory, and coordination. It's important to remember that an MRI doesn't always give us a definitive answer. But it will give us a much clearer picture. As for whether the tests will explain the memory loss, that's what we're hoping. The memory issues could be related to a number of different factors, including stress, vitamin deficiencies, or underlying neurological conditions. The MRI and blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can conduct more in-depth cognitive testing and provide a more detailed assessment of your memory and neurological function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes. That sounds… wise. More specialists… I suppose that is to be expected. I just… I want to understand what is happening, and find a way to…feel like myself again. This…fogginess… it is unsettling. Will the results be sent to me directly? Or to you? And… how long should I expect to wait to hear back? I understand it takes time, but…knowing roughly when to expect something would be…reassuring.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. I understand wanting to feel like yourself again, and we'll work together to get you there. The results of the blood tests will be sent directly to me, and I'll review them as soon as they're available. The MRI results will also be sent to me and to the neurologist I'm referring you to. I'll contact you as soon as I have the results of the blood tests, which usually takes about 3-5 business days. Scheduling the MRI might take a little longer, depending on availability, but we'll get that arranged as quickly as possible. Once we have the MRI results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. The neurologist will also be in touch to schedule an appointment with them. I'll also give you my office number and the number for the referral specialist. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. The numbers are… helpful. I will write down the specialist's name as well, just to be certain. Thank you, Doctor DeCosta. For your time, and for…listening. It is…reassuring to feel like I am being taken seriously. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. I think… that will be all for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
