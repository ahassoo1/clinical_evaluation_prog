DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I want to know more about where my people come from. My grandkids, they ask a lot of questions. I make boats, you see. Little wood boats. But they want to know where where come from, before the boats. I think... a test? For my blood? To see who I am, long ago?
DOCTOR: A… genealogical inquiry, then. And you believe a blood test will ascertain this information?
PATIENT: Blood test… yes. That's what I hear. My niece, she told me. She said it can tell you about your ancestors. Where they lived, a long, long time ago. I don't know much about… tests. Is that okay? Will it hurt? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: While blood tests can reveal certain genetic predispositions, Mr. Scobie, they are hardly a comprehensive record of ancestral origins. It's… a rather simplistic view. And yes, it involves a needle. A small prick, really. Though I suspect your expectations are… unrealistic. Do you have any specific medical concerns beyond this… historical curiosity?
PATIENT: Unrealistic? Oh. I… I just want to tell my grandkids something good. Something real. I don't need a lot. Just… where we come from. Not sick things, just… people. Is it a big needle? And… what will it tell me, if it's not a whole story? Will it tell me if I am… Marshallese, for sure? That's what I want to know. My mother, she always said we were. But things change, you know? People move.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, your mother’s recollections, while undoubtedly cherished, are not a substitute for documented history. These tests analyze your genetic markers, which may indicate a geographical origin, but it’s hardly definitive. And “for sure” is rarely a term we employ in medicine. It’s a small needle, yes, but if you're so averse to it, perhaps this isn’t the route to take. Are you experiencing any other symptoms that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: No… no sickness. Just… wanting to know. My grandkids, they go to school and learn about… everything. I want to be able to tell them something I know. Something about us. The needle… I don't like them. But… if it’s the only way, I guess. But what if it tells me… we aren’t Marshallese? What then? It will make my grandkids sad, maybe. That’s why I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, frankly, your concerns are… disproportionate. These tests are not designed to validate familial pride, but to provide—at best—a probabilistic estimate of ancestry. And while I understand your desire to please your grandchildren, basing your identity on a laboratory result seems… ill-advised. However, if you insist, we can proceed with a basic genetic panel. But I must reiterate, it is not a guarantee of “certainty”. Before we do, let me ask a few basic questions. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No… not much. Old age is the biggest thing. A little trouble with my knees, but that’s all. No hospital. I make boats, you see. Keeps me busy. And… I get Medicare. That’s important, right? For the test? I don’t want to pay a lot of money. Just want to know about my people. Not a big thing, really. But the grandkids… they are important.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover a portion of the cost, but there may be a co-pay. We can verify that with billing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No medicines. Just… fish oil. For my old bones. My niece, she says it’s good. And… sometimes, when my knees are bad, I rub some cream on them. But that’s all. No pills. I like to keep things simple. Just the fish oil and the cream. And the boats, of course. They don't need a prescription.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. Fish, mostly. We live on an island, you see. Lots of fish. And coconuts. No trouble with anything. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Simple food, simple life. Just want to know about my people. Is the test… a lot of blood? I don't like to lose too much.
DOCTOR: It's a standard vial, Mr. Scobie. A few milliliters. You won’t feel any significant depletion. Now, before we proceed, I need to document your height and weight. Please step onto the scale. And… I must ask, has there been any family history of significant illness – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Okay. My height… I think it’s not very much. Maybe five foot? And I’m not heavy. Not anymore. As for sickness… my mother, she died old. Very old. But she had trouble breathing at the end. And my father… he fell from a tree when he was young. That’s all I remember. No heart trouble, no… what was the other one? Cancer? No. Just old age, mostly. Simple people. Simple lives. We didn’t see much sickness.
DOCTOR: Five foot, two inches. One hundred and twenty-four pounds. Now, let's proceed with the blood draw. Nurse Patel will be in shortly to assist. I must reiterate, Mr. Scobie, this test is not a definitive answer to your genealogical inquiry, but it may provide some… limited information. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Limited… okay. I understand. It’s not a magic answer. Just… a little help. A little piece of the story. Nurse Patel… she’s good with needles? I hope so. I’m a little scared, but… for the grandkids. I’ll try. Just… be quick, please. And tell me if it hurts. A lot.
DOCTOR: Nurse Patel is quite proficient. And I assure you, it will be minimal discomfort. I will leave you to her care. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Scobie. We will discuss the results when they become available. Please try to relax.
