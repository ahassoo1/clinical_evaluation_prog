DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Well, my legs... my shins, they've got these bumps. Red ones. They hurt, a little. Not terrible, but enough to bother me. They just kinda showed up, you know? I wasn't doing anything special when they started.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Bumps on your shins, red and a little painful. And they just appeared recently, without any particular injury or activity?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. No falling or anything. I do a lot of walking at work, moving stuff around the warehouse, but I've been doing that for years. It's not like I did anything different lately. My wife, she noticed them first, actually. She's got a good eye for things. They're right here, see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see them. Let’s take a closer look. Are they itchy at all, or just painful?
PATIENT: Just painful, mostly. No itching. They feel kinda... hard, if that makes sense. Not soft bumps, you know? More like little knots under the skin. And they're kinda raised. Not flat. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, hard, raised knots that are painful, not itchy. Good to know. Alright, they do feel firm… and I'd say about half a centimeter to a centimeter in diameter. No warmth to the touch, I'm noticing. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with this, like fatigue or body aches?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, not at all. And no, I haven't felt tired or achy. Just... these bumps. I eat pretty good, I think. Not a fancy diet, but I get my three meals. And I drink plenty of water. I don't know if that helps or anything.
DOCTOR: That's good information to know. Let me just check your chart here... Alright, I see you’ve been a patient here for a few years. No significant medical history jumps out… No recent hospitalizations or major illnesses. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Nothing I know of, anyway. My wife always says I'm too tough for allergies! Never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that. And I haven't taken any new medicines lately. Just the usual, for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No new medications, no allergies. And you're taking medication for blood pressure, alright. What's the name and dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me think... it's Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. In the morning. My doctor, Dr. Reyes, prescribed it a few years back. She's a good doctor, but she's kinda busy, so I figured I'd come here to get this checked out quicker. These bumps are just bugging me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing, it could be a few things. One possibility is shin splints, even if you haven’t changed your activity level. Sometimes they just happen. Another possibility, and we need to rule this out, is a form of dermatitis. Do you use any new soaps, lotions, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. We’ve been using the same stuff for ages, me and my wife. Old Spice soap, always. And the same laundry detergent. I don't think it's the soap... or anything like that. These bumps… they just feel different. Like something under the skin. Not like a rash or irritation, you know? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Aluia. You're describing something specific and I appreciate you trying to explain it. Given your description and the fact that you're on Lisinopril, we should consider the possibility of drug-induced vasculitis. It’s not common, but it can cause similar symptoms. To be sure, though, I'd like to order a simple blood test—a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel—to rule out other causes and get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Vasculitis? That sounds kinda scary, Doc. Is that… serious? And a blood test? Yeah, okay, I guess. If that's what you think is best. I just want to know what's causing these bumps. And get rid of them! They're just… annoying, but I don't want them to get worse, you know? So, yeah, a blood test sounds fine. Where do we go from there?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, but we're just being thorough, Mr. Aluia. It's far more likely to be something less concerning, but it’s important to rule things out. The blood test will give us a lot more information. I’ll order the tests now. You can have them done at the lab just down the hall. It shouldn’t take too long. Once we have the results—usually a couple of days—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, try to avoid putting too much pressure on your shins, and let me know if the bumps change in any way—if they get bigger, more painful, or if you develop any other symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Avoid pressure, keep an eye on 'em... I can do that. A couple of days for the results, then a follow-up. Okay. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you looking into this. It's good to know what's going on, or at least trying to find out. Where do I go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. Glad I could help. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 203. The phlebotomist will know you're here for Dr. Galena's blood tests. They'll take good care of you. If you have any questions at all between now and your follow-up, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a lab requisition form. Get that to them and they’ll get you started. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay, room 203. Got it. Thank you again, Doc. You have a good day too.
