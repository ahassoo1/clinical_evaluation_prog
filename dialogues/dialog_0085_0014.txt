DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco, yes, that's me. Well, now… it's about some papers, I think. My wife, she said something about needing forms… for work? Something about time off, maybe? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's something to do with… being allowed time away, if I need it. She handles most of that sort of thing, you see. FMLA, was it? Or disability? One of those…
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you’re referring to paperwork related to potential leave from work, either through FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act – or possibly a short-term disability claim. I can certainly help with that. Before we focus on the forms specifically, though, I like to get a general understanding of your overall health. It helps me fill those forms out accurately and address any underlying concerns that might be relevant. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Overall health… right. Well, I’m 67, if that matters. And I try to stay active, walk a bit when the weather’s good. My wife keeps me on track, mostly. I don’t really… have any big problems, not that I know of. Just getting old, I suppose. Is there anything specific you need to know? I get a bit confused easily, so please, don’t hesitate to ask me to repeat something.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Limtiaco, and thank you for letting me know about your activity level. It's wonderful you're staying active. And absolutely, please don't hesitate to ask me to repeat anything, or to clarify if something isn't clear. We'll take our time. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me if you've been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me think. My wife… she does mention something about my blood pressure being a little high sometimes, at the doctor’s office. But I don’t feel anything, usually. And I don't take any pills for it, if that means anything. I don't remember ever being told I had diabetes… or heart problems, no. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just… get tired sometimes. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like you've been told you have slightly elevated blood pressure at times, but aren’t currently on medication for it. And you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes or heart problems. Fatigue is certainly something we can explore. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, sometimes my joints ache a little, especially in the mornings. Getting out of bed is… not as easy as it used to be. And I seem to… forget things more often these days. You were just asking me about that, weren’t you? It’s not like… a sudden thing, just… gradual. Mostly little things, like where I put my keys. Or what I was about to say. My wife says I repeat myself too. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Many people experience those symptoms as they get older. Joint aches, forgetfulness, and repeating yourself can all be common. It's good you're aware of them. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. Now that’s a difficult one. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, naturally. I had… something when I was a boy, a fever, very bad. I was quite sick, but I don’t remember much about it. And I broke my arm once, playing rugby, a long time ago. Other than that… I really can't recall any major illnesses or surgeries. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Do you need specifics? Because I'm afraid my memory isn’t very good with details like dates and names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Anything you can remember is helpful, but don’t worry about specifics. A childhood fever and a broken arm are good to know. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, even if it wasn’t a long stay?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think… I think… yes. When I was quite young, maybe five or six years old, I was in the hospital for a few days. It was that fever, I believe. They said it was something… tropical. I grew up in Tahiti, you see. But it was a very long time ago, and I don't remember much about it. Just… white walls and lots of people in uniforms. I haven't been in the hospital since then, not that I recall. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. A childhood hospitalization for a tropical fever. We'll make a note of that. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she lived a long life, but I think she had… something with her heart, towards the end. She was always tired, and short of breath. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He had to watch his sugar intake very carefully. I'm not sure about any other conditions. My family isn’t very good at talking about these things, you see. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject. Mostly, we just talked about fishing and the weather. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your father's diabetes is helpful. It’s common for families to not discuss medical history openly. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly? I’ve been married for a very long time, to a wonderful woman. We have children and grandchildren. I used to work… mostly office work, for a shipping company. I retired a few years ago. I don’t really… go out much anymore. Mostly just stay home with my wife, tend the garden, and watch television. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing that. It’s good to know you’re happily married and enjoying your retirement. Now, do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. My wife would never allow it. She’s very health-conscious, you see. And I always thought it was a rather foolish habit, anyway. Too expensive, and bad for your lungs. No, I've never been a smoker. And I don’t drink much alcohol either, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don't think so. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had any bad reactions to any medications, as far as I remember. And I can eat pretty much anything. My wife is the one with the allergies, she has to be careful about shellfish and nuts. But me? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Are you sure that’s all you need to know? It’s been a long conversation, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm worried I'm forgetting something.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Limtiaco, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. It sounds like you have a good grasp of your health history, and I appreciate you sharing all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A physical exam… sounds sensible. I haven't had one in a while, I think. But if you think it's necessary, then go ahead. Just… please be gentle. My joints aren't as flexible as they used to be. And try not to surprise me, if you can. I get a bit jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go, so there are no surprises. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which is common in people your age. It doesn’t seem to be anything concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lung sounds are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. As you mentioned, it sometimes runs a bit high. We’ll want to monitor this over time. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also common with age. I’m checking your pulses in your extremities… They are strong and regular. I’m noting some mild swelling in your ankles, which could be related to prolonged sitting. Overall, your exam is fairly normal for someone your age. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild ankle swelling are things we’ll want to keep an eye on. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Well… that sounds like a lot of things. Elevated blood pressure… ankle swelling… I knew I wasn't as young as I used to be. Does that mean I'm sick? Is it serious? My wife always worries when I go to the doctor. What does "monitoring" mean? Will I have to take pills? I really don't like taking pills. And I'm not sure what I did to make my ankles swell. I've been sitting a lot more since I retired, I suppose. I just want to be able to enjoy my retirement with my wife. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it’s completely understandable to be concerned when you hear things like "elevated blood pressure" and "swelling." But it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re seriously ill. These are things we often see with age, and often can be managed with lifestyle changes. “Monitoring” simply means we'll check your blood pressure periodically—perhaps at your next visit, or even at home if you're comfortable with that. We'll see if it stays consistently high, or if it fluctuates. As for the pills, we're not at the point of needing to prescribe anything yet. I'd like to recommend a few lifestyle changes first. Things like regular, gentle exercise – walking, gardening – and watching your salt intake can make a big difference. We can also discuss some strategies to elevate your legs when you're sitting, which can help reduce the swelling. We’ll start with these changes, and if your blood pressure remains consistently high despite these efforts, then we can discuss medication options. But let’s not worry about that right now. The goal is to help you enjoy your retirement and stay healthy, and we'll work together to achieve that. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. No pills right away. My wife will be very happy about that. Walking and gardening… I can do that. And I suppose I can try to cut back on the salt. It’s just… everything tastes so bland without it. Elevating my legs… that sounds manageable too. So, about those forms… the ones I came in for? Are we still going to do those? I'm afraid I'm forgetting what they were for exactly. Is it something to do with taking time off work? Or is it something more serious? I just want to make sure I have everything I need for my wife. She handles all the paperwork, you see. I’m just… the patient.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s get back to those forms. They are related to potential leave from work, specifically FMLA – the Family and Medical Leave Act – and possibly short-term disability. Your wife is right to bring them up. They allow you to take time off from work to address health concerns without losing your job or benefits. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fatigue you’ve mentioned, these forms could be useful to document your condition. I'll complete them for you, noting your current health status and recommending some follow-up – regular blood pressure checks, and perhaps some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes of the fatigue. Is your wife aware of the fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, she's very aware of it. She's the one who noticed it first, actually. She says I tire easily when I'm gardening, and I sit down more often when we go for walks. She’s always telling me to slow down. She worries about me, you see. So, you'll fill out those forms, and recommend some tests? What kind of tests? Will they be painful? I don't like needles very much. And how long will it take to get the results? My wife will want to know. She’s always thinking ahead. I just want to make sure everything is alright. And I want to be able to enjoy my retirement with my wife, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll complete the forms for you right now. And I’ll order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. These tests are very common and will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes of the fatigue. The blood work involves a simple blood draw, and while some people find it slightly uncomfortable, it's usually very quick. The needle is small, and the technician will be very gentle. It's usually over before you know it. The results typically take a few days to come back – usually 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I'll review them with you and discuss any necessary follow-up. I’ll also give you a copy for your wife. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with the lifestyle changes we discussed – regular walking and gardening, watching your salt intake, and elevating your legs when you're sitting. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… 3-5 days. That doesn't sound too bad. And just a little pinch with a needle? I can handle that. My wife will be happy to hear that. She worries so much. So, you’ll fill out the forms, order the tests, and I'll come back in a few days to get the results? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Do I need to fast? Or avoid any medications? I don't take many, but I want to be sure. I just want to make sure everything goes smoothly. And I want to be able to enjoy my retirement with my wife. Is that too much to ask? I think that's all my questions for now. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be, and I tend to get a bit confused easily. But you've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. You've asked all the right questions, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Yes, for the blood work, I’d like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand—that means no food or drinks, except for water. You can continue taking your usual medications, unless I specifically instruct you otherwise. The lab technician will give you detailed instructions when you go for the test. I’ll have the forms ready for you before you leave. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once the results are back. It sounds like you and your wife have a wonderful relationship, and I'm happy to help you both stay healthy and enjoy your retirement. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here are those forms. Take care, Mr. Limtiaco.
