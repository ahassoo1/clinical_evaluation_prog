DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Dr. Noordin. It's this nausea, see? Been happenin' most mornings now, for… oh, maybe a couple o’ weeks. Not a pleasant start to the day, I can tell ye. It’s usually right after I get up, before I’ve had much of anything to eat.
DOCTOR: Right, nausea in the mornings for a couple of weeks. And it happens before you've eaten anything?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Before. Sometimes I even feel a wee bit shaky with it, but it doesn't last long. It’s just… unsettling. I’ve been told I’ve got a bit of a weak heart, ye ken? That's why I thought I should come in, just to be sure it wasn’t somethin’ to worry about with that.
DOCTOR: I see. And has a doctor specifically told you about a weak heart, or was this something you were informed of by a family member, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, aye, a doctor told me. Dr. MacIntyre, back in Inverness. That was… oh, must be five years ago now? He said somethin’ about the muscle being a bit… thickened, I think he said. He put me on some water tablets, and I’ve been takin’ them ever since. Felt alright for the most part, ‘til this nausea started. I don't recall the specifics of the diagnosis, to be honest. I'm not the best with rememberin' medical terms.
DOCTOR: Right, water tablets… and a thickened heart muscle. It's good you're reminding me about that. Do you happen to know the name of the water tablets you’re taking?
PATIENT: Och, now that's a tricky one. They're wee white pills, that much I know. The box... I usually just get them refilled at the chemist. Let me think… I think the box had somethin' to do with 'furosemide' on it? Or maybe 'frusemide'? I could be completely wrong, mind you. My memory's not what it used to be for things like that. I just know I take one every mornin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll get to the bottom of the medication list later. Let's go back to this nausea. Besides happening in the mornings and sometimes with shakiness, is there anything else you've noticed about it?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn't last long, thankfully. Usually just a few minutes. And it's not like I’m bringin’ anything up, if ye ken what I mean? Just a queasy feelin' in me stomach. And… hmm… it seems a wee bit worse if I lie flat for too long before gettin' up. Like if I've had a restless night and been turnin' about for ages. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Nausea in the mornings, not vomiting, brief duration, and potentially worsened by lying flat. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Och, aye. Now that ye mention it… my ankles have been a wee bit swollen lately. Not terribly, mind you, but I’ve noticed me shoes feelin' a bit tight. And I've been feelin’ a bit more breathless than usual, especially when I’m walkin' up the stairs. But I figured that was just gettin’ older, to be honest. I’ve never been a fit man.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and ankle swelling… Okay. And how long have you noticed the swelling and breathlessness?
PATIENT: Oh, the breathlessness has been creepin' on for a few months now, gradually gettin' worse. But the ankles… they’ve only been swollen for a week or so, along with the nausea. It all just seems to have come on at once, which is why I thought I should come see ye. I don’t want to be a bother, but… it’s a bit worryin’.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Benic. It's good you came in. Let's do a quick examination, and then we'll figure out what's going on. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Dr. Noordin. Do whatever ye need to do. I'm happy to cooperate. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious. Just gettin’ old, maybe? But it's best to be sure, as my mum used to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be great. I'll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay. And again… I'm hearing a slightly rapid heartbeat, and there's some congestion in your lungs. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Now, let’s take a look at those ankles. Could you point them downwards for me?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem. There ye go. They do feel a bit puffy, don’t they? I usually just put me feet up in the evenin', but it doesn't seem to make much difference lately. I can feel the bone under them, but there’s definitely some swellin’. It's not as bad as some folk I’ve seen, but it’s not right, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not right. There is definitely some edema – that’s the medical term for swelling – in both ankles. It’s pitting edema, meaning that the indentation remains for a short time after I press on it. Given your symptoms – the nausea, the breathlessness, the ankle swelling, and your history of a heart condition – I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Dr. Noordin. Whatever ye think is best. Tests… what sort of tests are we talkin' about? Blood tests? And is it likely to be serious? I'm not wantin' to worry needlessly, but I like to know what I'm facin', ye ken? I’ve got a wee bit of a disposition for worryin', if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll start with a blood test to check your kidney function, your electrolytes, and also a marker called BNP, which can help us assess if your heart is under strain. We’ll also need an EKG – that’s a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. And, I think it’s important to get a chest X-ray to see if there’s any fluid build-up in your lungs. As for whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say definitively. These tests will help us rule out some possibilities and narrow down the cause. It could be related to your heart condition, or it could be something else entirely. The nausea and breathlessness, combined with the swelling, suggest that we need to investigate further. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s important to take these symptoms seriously. We're going to figure this out together, step by step. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes a good bit o' sense, Dr. Noordin. Blood tests, EKG, and a chest X-ray. It sounds… thorough, which is reassuring. I suppose it's best to know, even if it's not good news. And ye're right, it's best to be careful. My mum always said worryin' doesn’t change the outcome, but it does change how ye feel. Still, I'd rather know what I’m up against. When can I get these tests done? And will I need to come back again for the results?
DOCTOR: Your mum was a very wise woman. We can get the blood tests and EKG done today, right here in the clinic. It’ll take about an hour or so. The chest X-ray, we’ll need to send you to the imaging center down the street. They can usually fit you in within the hour. Once we have the results – and I expect they’ll be available within 24 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll go through everything in detail and decide on the best course of action. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule that appointment for you before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild diuretic – a water tablet – to help reduce some of the fluid build-up. It's a different one to what you’re currently taking, just to see if it makes a difference. It’s important to take it as directed and monitor your weight. If you experience any dizziness or shortness of breath, stop taking it and call the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Dr. Noordin. New water tablet, blood tests today, EKG today, and chest X-ray. Weight monitoring and watch for dizziness. I can manage that. Sarah will schedule the follow-up appointment, ye said? Excellent. And thank ye, Dr. Noordin. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. It’s a weight off me mind, knowin' we’re gettin' to the bottom of it. Now, shall we get those blood tests done? I’m ready when ye are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get started. Sarah will be in shortly to take your blood. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or Sarah know if you have any questions or concerns at any point. Just relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye again, Dr. Noordin. I will. .
