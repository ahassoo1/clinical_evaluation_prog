DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I’m one of the internal medicine physicians here. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Andraca, was it? Yes, well… honestly, I just thought I’d pop in. Been meaning to for a while, really. Just to see what's new, you know? Old age, I suppose. Things start… slipping. Not that I feel particularly unwell, mind you. Just… curious.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, even if you’re not experiencing specific concerns. "Just checking in" is a great reason to come see a doctor. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about what “slipping” means to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Slipping… well, it’s not anything serious. It’s just… remembering things. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses. Though, to be fair, I always leave them on top of my head. It’s just… not as sharp as it used to be, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me I should write things down. Honestly, all this fuss. It’s not like I’m losing my mind. Just… forgetful. A little.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing some normal age-related memory changes, and it's good that you're aware of them. It’s also very common for family members to notice these things first. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe how long you’ve been noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? That’s a difficult one. It's not like it happened suddenly, you know? It's been… gradual. Years, I suppose. Since… well, since Harold passed, really. It's been almost ten years now. Maybe it’s just grief, you know? Things get… fuzzy when you're sad. Though, I've always been a bit… scattered. Harold always said I lived in a dream world. Honestly, men… They never understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. Experiencing loss can definitely affect memory and concentration. It's good you recognize that connection. And it sounds like this has been going on for a while, which is helpful information. Just to be thorough, besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling or functioning?
PATIENT: Hmm… functioning… well, I still manage. I do my gardening, of course. And I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week. Though, sometimes I get… tired. More tired than I used to, perhaps. And I’m not as… quick. I used to be a very good bridge player, you know. Now… well, now I mostly just enjoy the tea and biscuits. Honestly, I think it's just old age creeping in. It’s not anything to make a fuss about. Though, my hands do ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. It's probably just arthritis. My mother had terrible arthritis. A dreadful thing.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re still very active, which is wonderful. Fatigue and some aches and pains are common as we get older, but it's good to explore them a little further. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Illnesses… well, I had pneumonia once, a very bad bout of it. And I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy, quite a long time ago now. Let me think… I'm sure there was something else, but it’s all a bit… hazy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not the best at remembering these things. I always relied on Harold to keep track of all my medical records. It's a terrible thing, losing your memory. A truly dreadful thing. Though, I don't think any of it was serious. Nothing life-threatening, at least.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good start. Pneumonia, gallbladder removal, and a hysterectomy. We can always look up your records to confirm details, don't worry. And have you had any surgeries besides those?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Surgeries… Let me think. Harold did have me get a bunion removed on my left foot, a few years before… well, you know. It was quite painful, actually. And I think… yes, I had my appendix out when I was a child. A very long time ago now. It was quite the ordeal, I remember my mother being terribly worried. Honestly, I think that’s all of them. Unless… oh, I had a cataract removed from my right eye, maybe five years ago? It was a very quick procedure, thankfully. Though my vision isn't what it used to be, even with glasses. It's just… getting old, I suppose. Everything starts to wear down, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: You’ve had quite a bit done over the years. To clarify, that’s a bunion removal, appendectomy, and cataract removal. Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family conditions… Well, my mother had terrible arthritis, as I mentioned. And her sister, Auntie Mei, she had diabetes. A very serious thing, diabetes. And… oh, my grandfather, on my father's side, he had heart trouble. A very frail man, he was. Always complaining about his chest. Honestly, I can't remember much else. My family wasn't one for talking about their health. They thought it was bad luck, you know? Very superstitious people. Though, I don't think I've inherited any of those conditions, thankfully. I feel quite healthy, all things considered. Though, I do worry about my heart sometimes. Just a little. It's just… getting old, I suppose. Everything starts to worry you, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Arthritis, diabetes, and heart trouble in the family. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I take a small pill for my blood pressure, Doctor, the pink one. And I take a calcium supplement for my bones, you know, to prevent osteoporosis. My daughter is very insistent about that one. And… oh, I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Honestly, I don't think that's all. Perhaps a pain reliever occasionally, when my hands ache. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing strong, I assure you. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? It’s not good for the liver. My friend, Mrs. Petrov, she takes so many pills, it’s frightening. Honestly, I think I’m quite good at managing my health, all things considered. Though, sometimes I forget to take them. It's just… a little forgetful, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking a blood pressure medication, a calcium supplement, a multivitamin, and occasionally an over-the-counter pain reliever. And you’ve mentioned some occasional forgetfulness with taking them. That’s helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Though, sometimes I get a little itchy when I eat shellfish, but I don’t think that’s an allergy. Just a little sensitivity, perhaps. And I don’t think I’ve ever been allergic to any medications. Honestly, I’m quite lucky, all things considered. My granddaughter, though, she’s allergic to everything! Poor thing. She has to carry an EpiPen everywhere she goes. It’s dreadful. But me? No, I’m quite allergy-free, thank goodness. Though, sometimes my skin gets a little dry in the winter. But that’s just the weather, you know? Not an allergy. Honestly, I don’t think I have any allergies at all. Just a little sensitive skin sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies, just a little sensitive skin. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Social history… well, as I mentioned, my husband, Harold, passed away almost ten years ago now. We were married for fifty years. A very good man, he was. We had one daughter, Emily, she lives in California now. I see her a few times a year. I mostly keep to myself these days. I volunteer at the library, and I have a few friends I have tea with occasionally. Nothing too exciting, really. I used to enjoy bridge, but I haven't played in a while. It’s just… harder to get around these days. And I miss Harold terribly. He was a very good bridge player, you know. Honestly, I don't have much of a social life these days. Just a quiet life, really. A little lonely sometimes, but I manage. Though, my daughter keeps telling me I should join a senior center. But I don't think that's for me. I prefer my own company, really. A little peace and quiet. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've had a full life, and it's understandable to feel lonely after such a long and meaningful partnership. It's good you have your daughter and friends, and that you enjoy volunteering. Alright, Ms. Calvery, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It’ll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. I suppose it can't hurt. Though I'm not much for poking and prodding, you know? I always feel a bit silly being examined. But if you think it's important… yes, alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I have a pot roast in the slow cooker, you know. And I don't want it to overcook. Though I'm sure it will be fine. Go ahead, Doctor. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Calvery, everything sounds good overall. Your heart and lungs are healthy, your reflexes are normal, and your balance is within normal limits for your age. I noticed you mentioned some hand aches earlier. Can you show me where the pain is located and describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It's mostly in my knuckles, you see? All of them, really. Especially in the mornings. It’s… stiff, you know? And a little achy. It makes it hard to open jars sometimes, and button my coat. It's not a terrible pain, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. It eases up a bit after I move them around for a while. But it's always worse in the morning. And sometimes it swells up a little, especially if it's cold. Honestly, I think it's just arthritis. My mother had terrible arthritis, you know. A dreadful thing. It crippled her hands completely. I'm hoping mine won’t get that bad. I try to use heat packs, and I take a little ibuprofen sometimes. But it doesn't always help. Honestly, I think it’s just old age creeping in. Everything starts to ache, doesn't it? It’s just… a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ms. Calvery, there is some visible swelling and tenderness in your knuckles, which is consistent with arthritis. Based on your description and the physical exam, it appears to be osteoarthritis, which is the most common type of arthritis. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests, specifically a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test. I’d also like to get an X-ray of your hands to assess the extent of the joint damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests and X-rays… Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don't really like being poked and prodded, you know? And I don't like radiation. But if it will help you figure out what's wrong… yes, alright. Go ahead. But don't take too long, please. And try to be gentle. Honestly, I just want to know what's going on. And if there's anything I can do about it. I don't want to end up like my mother, you know. Crippled and helpless. But if it's just arthritis… well, I suppose I can live with that. Just as long as it doesn't get any worse. Go ahead, Doctor. But try to be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood tests will just require a small sample, and the X-ray involves very low levels of radiation. We’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and X-ray. You can get those done at the lab and radiology department here at the clinic. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can continue to manage your symptoms with heat packs and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical therapist? Well… I don't know. I’ve never been to a physical therapist before. Is it… painful? I don’t really like being stretched and pulled, you know? I’m a bit fragile. Honestly, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea. Perhaps I should just wait and see what the tests say. I don't want to start doing anything that will make things worse. Perhaps I should just stick to the heat packs and over-the-counter pain relievers for now. I’m a bit wary of trying new things, you know? I’m a bit… set in my ways. Perhaps I should just wait. Yes, let's just wait and see what the tests say. I don’t want to rush into anything. Honestly, I think I’ll just wait. Thank you, though. But let’s just wait.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. That’s perfectly fine. We can certainly wait and see what the test results show before considering other options. We’ll proceed at your pace. To summarize, we’ve ordered blood tests and an X-ray of your hands to assess the extent of your arthritis. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available to discuss them and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Though… honestly, I’m a little worried. About the arthritis, I mean. I don’t want to end up like my mother, you know. Crippled and helpless. But you seem very competent, so I trust your judgment. I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see. And hope for the best. Honestly, I’m a bit anxious, but I trust you. You’ve been very kind and patient. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. Perhaps… perhaps you could just tell me one thing. Will the arthritis get worse? That’s my biggest worry, you see. Will it get worse?
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Ms. Calvery. Arthritis is a progressive condition, meaning it can get worse over time. However, the rate of progression varies significantly from person to person. Some people experience slow, gradual changes, while others experience more rapid deterioration. There are many things we can do to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease, including medication, physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, and assistive devices. Early diagnosis and treatment are key. It’s important to remember that with proper management, many people with arthritis are able to maintain a good quality of life and continue to enjoy their favorite activities. We will work together to create a plan that's right for you. Do you want me to give you some information sheets about arthritis, to take home with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Information sheets would be lovely. It's good to be prepared, you know? Knowing what to expect. Though… honestly, I'm not very good at reading medical jargon. It's all so confusing. But I'll try. Yes, please, information sheets would be helpful. And thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, a little. Though I'm still a bit worried, of course. But I trust your judgment. And I'll try to stay positive. Yes, information sheets would be lovely. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. Now… I suppose I should be going. I have a pot roast to check on, you know. It can't be left unattended for too long. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. Here you are. These pamphlets have information about different types of arthritis, treatment options, and self-management strategies. And don't worry about the medical jargon; we can go over anything you don't understand at your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a little. Just remember to check your pot roast! Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Goodbye, Ms. Calvery, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
