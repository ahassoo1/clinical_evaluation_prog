DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Tayar is name. Uh… travel. Need… travel okay? My wife… she would do all the papers. Now… not so good for me. I go… where I go, I forget. Something with… mountains? Before… before everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you’re concerned about your ability to remember things, particularly in relation to travel, and that there may have been something that happened recently that's affecting your memory. Could you elaborate a bit on what you mean by “everything”?
PATIENT: Everything… …She is gone. My wife. Big sickness. Now… I go see family. Nepal. But… before, we plan. She do all. Now… I don’t know what she plan. Shots? Papers? I just… want go. Is that okay? Is good to go?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I am so very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. It's very brave of you to come in and address these concerns. Yes, it is good that you are thinking about this before you travel. We absolutely want to make sure you are able to go safely. To help me understand what we need to do, could you tell me approximately when your wife passed away?
PATIENT: …Time is… hard. Maybe… six months? Seven? Before hot season. We always go to mountains after hot season. She… she loved the flowers. Not much flower now. Everything… grey. Is it important when? I just want make sure… safe. For her. She would want me safe.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Tayar, but don’t feel pressured to be exact. Approximately six to seven months ago is helpful. Knowing the timing helps me understand the context. You’re very thoughtful to want to be safe for your wife, that's admirable. To help me assess what preparations you might need, could you tell me a little bit about your travel plans?
PATIENT: Nepal. Kathmandu, I think? She book ticket. I find it… in box. Fly… long time. Then… village. High up. Very cold. I go see brother. He have farm. Yaks. Is… very simple. Before… we go fancy hotel. Now… brother help. He say come. Safe. I don’t know… what need for yak farm? Do yak need… shots?
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of your brother to offer his help. We certainly don’t need to worry about shots for the yaks themselves! To clarify, Mr. Tayar, you have a plane ticket to Kathmandu, Nepal, and you'll be staying with your brother on his farm. Do you know approximately when you are planning to travel?
PATIENT: …Ticket… in box. August. Soon. Maybe… two weeks? Three? She… she always book early. For good price. I look at calendar… I forget. Soon is good. Before the… before the rains come again, she said. Is that okay? Soon. Is good.
DOCTOR: “Soon” is helpful, Mr. Tayar. Let’s aim for within the next three weeks, to be safe. To ensure you’re prepared for your trip and your health is protected, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Sickness… before. Long time. When I small. Fever. Very bad fever. Then… nothing. Wife… she take care. She always know. Now… I don't remember. Maybe… some cut. Fall down. Farm work. Not big. Not… surgery. No surgery. I think. Everything is… fuzzy. Is that okay? No big sickness. Wife take care.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tayar. It's common to have difficulty remembering details from the past, especially when you’ve been under stress. The important thing is that you haven’t had any recent or significant medical issues. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Wife… she ask always. Before travel. Before… everything. I eat… everything. Spicy food. Brother make good spicy food. No problem. No rash. No… swelling. I think. Maybe… dust. Sometimes. On farm. But not allergy. Just… cough. Is that okay? No big allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Tayar. A sensitivity to dust is not uncommon, especially when traveling to a rural environment. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. No pills. Wife… she give me some… tea. For sleep. Before travel. But… not now. Just… water. And spicy food. I think. She keep everything. In box. I don’t know… what is in box. Is that okay? No pills. Just… tea. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you’ve been managing well without regular medication. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… Long time. Brother… he okay. Strong. Farm work. Parents… gone. Long time. Before I come. Sickness. Old age. I think. Wife… she know. She ask always. About everything. I don’t… I don’t remember. Nepal… different. People… get sick. Sometimes. But I don’t know… details. Is that okay? I don't remember. Long time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tayar. It’s understandable that you don’t remember details, especially given the circumstances. Before we move on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No smoke. Wife… she hate smoke. Very bad for health. No drink. No… those things. Never. Just… water. And spicy food. Nepal… simple life. No… bad things. Is that okay? No. Never. Only… water. And spicy food.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Tayar. That’s very healthy. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… okay. But… quick, please? I… I don’t like doctors. Wife… she always come. She explain. Now… just me. Quick is good. Is that okay? Quick exam. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. I'll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears are clear, your nose looks good, and your throat is clear. Finally, I'd like to feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Thank you. Quick. You are quick. Is good. Can I… go now? I need… sit down. And drink water. Is that okay? Finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, you’ve done very well. The exam is finished now. Before you sit down, I want to discuss some preventative measures for your trip to Nepal. Given your history of forgetting things, it's important to have a plan in place. I recommend creating a checklist of essential items to bring, including any medications you might need, your travel documents, and a copy of your insurance information. It might also be helpful to travel with a friend or family member who can assist you with remembering important details. I’d also recommend getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and typhoid, as these are common in Nepal. And I recommend talking to your brother about the availability of medical care in his village. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: Checklist… vaccinations… brother… Too much. Everything is… too much. I just want go. See brother. Be safe. Can… can you write it down? Checklist… vaccinations… so I don’t forget? Write it down. Please. And… brother is good. He will help. He always help. Is that okay? Write it down.

I’ll write down a checklist for you, including: Travel Documents: Passport, visa , flight itinerary Insurance Information: Copy of your insurance card and policy details Medications: Any necessary prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, and a copy of your prescription list. Vaccinations: Hepatitis A and Typhoid. I'll provide a referral to a travel clinic nearby. Contact Information: Your brother’s contact information, as well as the contact information for your primary care physician and insurance company. Here you go. I’ve also included the name and number for a travel clinic nearby that can advise you on any other necessary vaccinations or preventative measures. Do you have any questions about any of these items?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. So many things. Vaccination… clinic… I will… ask brother. He know. He will help. Is that okay? Ask brother? He is good with… with things. Checklist… I will try. But… if I forget… Is that okay? If I forget?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tayar. Asking your brother for help is an excellent idea. He sounds very supportive, and it’s good to have someone you trust to assist you. And if you forget anything, that’s okay too. We’re here to help. You can always call the clinic, and we’ll do our best to assist you. Don’t worry about it too much. Your health and well-being are the most important things. I’m also going to write you a short note for your brother explaining that you may have some memory lapses and that he can contact me if he has any concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, thank you. You are very kind. Brother… will help. And you… you write note. That is good. I just… want go home. Be safe. See brother. Is that okay? Thank you. Very much. I think… I am finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, I believe you are finished. Remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms before or during your trip, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
