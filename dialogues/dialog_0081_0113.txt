DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor...Paulino, was it? Yes, well, it's this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems I’m always going. Not a lot each time, mind you, just… often. It's a nuisance, really. Old age, I suppose. Though my wife, bless her, thinks I drink too much tea. Which is nonsense, of course.
DOCTOR: “Nonsense,” you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, this frequent urination?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. I wouldn’t say it’s new new, just… more noticeable lately. It’s hard to keep track of these things when you’re… well, when you’re keeping busy. I have a farm to look after, you know.
DOCTOR: A few months, coming and going. And is it anything particular that seems to trigger it, or does it just happen regardless?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. Well, cold weather, maybe? I seem to go more when it's chilly. And if I drink anything at all, really. Even water. Though, like I said, my wife thinks I drink too much tea… She doesn’t understand a man needs his tea. It’s a comfort, you know? Not everything’s about being… efficient.
DOCTOR: So, cold weather and fluid intake seem to be associated with increased frequency. And you mentioned tea specifically. What kind of tea do you typically drink, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts! Black tea, mostly. Earl Grey sometimes. And a bit of chamomile before bed, to help me sleep. Though not much helps with sleep these days. It's not the tea, Doctor. I’ve been drinking tea my whole life. It’s just… what old men do. It's not like I'm gulping down buckets of it, you know? Just a normal amount. I think it's just a weak bladder, honestly. A natural consequence of… well, of getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes I feel like I don’t quite empty my bladder completely. Just a little bit left, you know? And occasionally, a bit of a… a burning sensation when I go. Not terrible, mind you, just… noticeable. And I wake up once or twice at night to go, which is irritating. Though, like I said, the sleep’s not been the best lately. It’s probably all connected, isn’t it? Just old age getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so incomplete emptying, occasional burning, and nocturia – waking up at night to urinate. And you also mentioned the occasional burning sensation. Is that consistent, or does it come and go with the frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely not every time. Maybe once a week, if that. It's not sharp, like a proper pain, just… a little bit of discomfort. Like a tickle, almost. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t want to make a fuss about it. I’ve lived a long life, and I've had my share of aches and pains. I just thought I'd mention it, since you asked. It's probably nothing. My wife worries too much as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but that's been sorted. I take a pill for that, a small white one. Can't remember the name of it, to be honest. And my blood pressure’s a bit high, but nothing too serious. And… I had my prostate checked once, a long time ago. Seemed fine then, but… honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much of it. Old age, you know? The memory's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so history of heart trouble, hypertension, and a previous prostate check. Do you recall when you had that prostate check?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? That was… Oh, dear. That must have been… twenty years ago? Maybe more? I was still running the farm with my son then. He’s taken over now, bless him. It was at the old clinic, down by the river. Dr… Dr. Kowalski, I think it was. A nice man, but I haven’t seen him in years. Honestly, Doctor, time just slips away. It all seems like a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. That needed a cast, but I don’t know if you’d call that a surgery. And… I had my appendix out, many years ago. That was… unpleasant. But other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I’ve always been a healthy man, mostly. Just this… this going to the bathroom thing now. It's a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my wife, of course. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years now. Wonderful woman, though she worries too much. And my son, he took over the farm. Got two grandchildren, a boy and a girl. Lovely children. As for medical history… My father had heart trouble, I think. And my mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I remember her complaining about her joints. But other than that… I don't really know. We weren't ones for talking about illnesses. It was considered bad luck, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications you’re currently taking besides the pill for your heart?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I've always been able to take any medication the doctors gave me. And, well, just that little white pill for my heart. Can’t remember the name, as I said. And… Sometimes I take a bit of something for my joints when they ache. Just an over-the-counter thing, you know. Nothing serious. My wife buys it for me. She keeps track of all that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a terrible one for remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. That will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. Then, I’d like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it will give me a better idea of what's going on. We’ll also need a urine sample to rule out any infection. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Oh, dear. Well, I… I suppose not. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… not a pleasant thought, is it? Still, I trust your judgment, Doctor. You're the professional. And a urine sample, yes, that's fine. Anything to get to the bottom of this… this going business. But please, be gentle with that… exam. Old age, you know. Things aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… good. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished, which is not uncommon with age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses appreciated. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment… I need to prepare for the rectal exam. I'll be right back with the necessary supplies. Please, just lie on your side with your knees drawn up.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Just… let me know when you’re ready. This is all… a bit much, isn't it? Still, I suppose it's necessary. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, that's for sure. I’ll just… lie here. I’ll try to relax, though I can’t promise much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. I'm going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess the size and texture of your prostate. This will only take a moment. …Prostate is enlarged, but smooth. No obvious nodules appreciated. There is some tenderness upon palpation. Alright. Now, I’ll just need that urine sample. Here’s a cup. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. That means, start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't… pleasant. But thank you, Doctor. It's over now, thankfully. A urine sample, yes, of course. Mid-stream, you say? I think I can manage that. It's just… all a bit undignified, isn't it? Getting old… definitely not for the faint of heart. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Segretto. I'll be here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. That wasn’t easy, I can tell you. Getting old makes everything a bit… more complicated. I hope that's what you needed. Now, what do you think? What's wrong with me? Is it serious? I just want to get back to the farm, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. I'll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. Based on your history and the physical exam, and pending the lab results, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That's an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is very common in men your age. It can cause frequent urination, incomplete emptying, nocturia, and occasional burning, as you’ve described. The tenderness I felt on the exam could be indicative of some mild inflammation as well. It’s not cancer, and it's not necessarily serious, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. We'll need to rule out other causes with the urine sample, like a urinary tract infection.
PATIENT: Not cancer… that’s good. Very good. BPH… that sounds complicated. And bothersome… that’s putting it mildly. So, what do we do about it? Pills? Surgery? I don’t want any surgery, Doctor. I’m too old for surgery. I just want to be able to sleep through the night and not have to run to the bathroom every five minutes. Is that too much to ask? And what about the tea? Can I still have my tea?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Segretto. Fortunately, there are several treatment options for BPH that don’t involve surgery. We'll start with the least invasive options first. The urinalysis will help rule out infection, and then we can discuss medications. There are alpha-blockers that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors that can shrink the prostate gland over time. We can also explore lifestyle modifications, like timed voiding and bladder training. As for the tea… caffeine can irritate the bladder in some people, so I would recommend limiting your intake, at least initially, to see if it makes a difference. We can revisit that once we have the lab results and start treatment. I'll write you a prescription for a trial course of Tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker. Start with a low dose and see how you feel. I'll also order a PSA test – that's a blood test to screen for prostate cancer, just to be on the safe side. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you’re responding to the medication. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A PSA test… just to be safe, you say? Very well. I suppose that’s sensible. And Tamsulosin… a low dose, you say? I’ll try it. I don’t like taking pills, but I suppose I have to do something. Limiting the tea… that’ll be the hardest part. My wife will be pleased, though. She’s always telling me I drink too much. Two weeks… alright. I’ll see you then. Hopefully, this pill will work its magic. I just want my life back, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? Thank you, Doctor Paulino. I appreciate your help. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need a nice cup of tea… even if it’s the last one for a while.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Remember, if you experience any side effects from the medication, such as dizziness or lightheadedness, stop taking it and call my office immediately. And please, try to relax and take things one day at a time. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
