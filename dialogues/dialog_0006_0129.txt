DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my… well, it's my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years, I suppose. Is that what this is about? It’s probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Black, tarry stools... and you're taking pain medication for arthritis, red pills, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, red pills. And they help, mind you. I can’t be hobbling around all day, can I? It's not like I want to be in pain. Honestly, doctors these days... always making a mountain out of a molehill. But fine, yes. Red pills. For the arthritis. And the… unpleasantness. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay… the chart does show you're on a pretty consistent dose of… let me see… tramadol. And you said this black stool is recent?
PATIENT: Tramadol, that’s the one. And no, it’s not sudden. I just noticed it more lately. Honestly, it could be anything, couldn’t it? I eat beets sometimes. Maybe that’s it? Though I haven’t had any in… well, it's been a while. Look, I don't spend my days examining my… output. Is this going to take long? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Beets are unlikely to cause black stools, Dawnetta. Tramadol can sometimes cause stomach upset, and that could lead to this, but… we need to rule other things out. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Like what? I’m seventy-three years old, everything changes! My knees ache more, my hair’s thinner, my memory… well, never mind. You’re the doctor, you tell me. No, nothing else. Just the… dark business. And the pain pills. Honestly, I don’t understand why we’re even talking about this. It’s probably just old age. And beets. Possibly beets.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to be a bit more thorough, just to be safe. Have you ever had any issues with anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? What do you take me for? A weakling? I’ve lived a full life, thank you very much. I worked hard, I raised a family… I haven’t been lying around feeling faint. No, I've never had any… anemia. Though, now that you mention it, I have been a little tired lately. But that’s probably just… everything. Honestly, this is starting to feel very dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay… and no nausea, vomiting, or any abdominal pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just… the stool. Dark. Unpleasant. Look, are you going to poke and prod me? Because if so, I’m leaving. I’ve got things to do. And frankly, I’ve had perfectly good doctors before who didn’t need to interrogate me about my… bodily functions for half an hour. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding just yet, Dawnetta. Just trying to get a clear picture. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check. It’ll be fast. Blood pressure, pulse, and I’ll listen to your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. Honestly, I don’t see what good this is going to do, but… fine. Get on with it. Just don't expect me to be happy about it. And don't take too long. My bridge partners are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, if you’ll just lie back… let me listen to your abdomen. Sounds are… normal. No distention, no tenderness. But we still need to rule a few things out. I’m going to order a stool test, to check for blood. And a complete blood count, just to see if you're anemic. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly. Fine. Whatever. Just… tell me where to go. And how long it will take. I don’t have all day. And if it involves anything… invasive, I’m warning you now, I’m leaving. I have a perfectly good reputation to uphold, you know. And I’m not about to be subjected to indignities at my age. Just… get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. The stool test is just a small sample you collect at home, instructions are on this form. The blood draw will be done right here in the clinic. It'll be quick, just a few vials. It’ll probably take about fifteen minutes. We’ll get the results back in a few days. The nurse will show you where to go for the blood draw and explain the stool collection process. We’ll call you with the results as soon as we have them. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes? Well, that’s… tolerable, I suppose. And yes, just one thing. How much is all this going to cost me? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don’t want any nasty surprises. Honestly, doctors these days… always thinking about the money. Just tell me straight. And hurry up. I have a bridge game to get to. And tell the nurse to be gentle. Really gentle.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover most of it, Dawnetta, but there may be a small co-pay. I can’t give you an exact amount without submitting the claim, but it shouldn’t be excessive. The billing department can give you a more precise estimate if you’d like. Alright, well, I think that covers everything for now. Just collect the stool sample, get the blood draw, and we’ll be in touch. And don't worry, I’ll tell the nurse to be gentle. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Honestly. A mountain out of a molehill. Fine. Whatever. Just… don't expect me to be happy about it.
