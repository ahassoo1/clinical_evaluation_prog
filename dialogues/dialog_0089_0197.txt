DOCTOR: Good morning, San. I’m Dr. Roseburroagh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, for ride-sharing. You know, like for taxis and such. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do that legally. I’d like to get it sorted as quickly as possible, if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a medical certificate to drive commercially, for ride-sharing. We can definitely get that sorted for you today. To do that, I’ll need to do a quick assessment to make sure you meet the health requirements. First, let’s go over some basics. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, no problems since. And my knees… they bother me a little sometimes, old logging injury. Nothing a good stretch can’t fix, usually. Oh, and I take something for my blood pressure, a small dose. That's about it, I think. Do you need to know the name of the blood pressure medicine? I can look it up later if you do.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you don’t mind, knowing the name of the blood pressure medication would be helpful. Also, do you remember approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. The medicine is… Lisinopril, I believe. And the gallbladder… let me see… it was 2005, I think. Early 2005. It was right after my divorce, actually. I remember because I had to take a lot of time off work for it. It was at St. Luke's Hospital, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and gallbladder removal in early 2005 at St. Luke's. Thank you. And when you say your knees bother you sometimes, can you describe how they bother you?
PATIENT: Well, it's not constant pain, you understand? Mostly just stiffness, especially if I’ve been sitting for a long time. And sometimes, after a lot of walking, they ache a bit. Nothing debilitating, I can still get around just fine. But bending down is… tricky sometimes. I've learned to be careful. It doesn’t keep me from my work, though. I still operate the machinery.
DOCTOR: Alright, stiffness and aching with prolonged sitting or walking, difficulty bending. Good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything, take most things… I haven’t had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I can remember. I did get stung by a bee once, as a child, but that’s just a normal bee sting. No bad reaction, just a bit of swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, years ago, but I haven’t touched a drop in… oh, must be fifteen years now. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested. Is that what you're asking? I just want to be clear I'm a pretty healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, thank you. That's good to know. Now, before we move on to the physical part of the exam, do you have any family history of heart problems, stroke, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, like me. And he had a stroke when he was quite old, in his eighties. My mother was healthy as a horse, though. Never a sick day in her life. And my brother… he has diabetes, but that’s about it. Does that information help? I try to keep track of these things. It’s important, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and stroke in your father, diabetes in your brother. Okay. To proceed with the medical certificate, I’ll need to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it done, please. The sooner I can get this card, the better. I have a few rides booked for next week, and I need to be sure I’m legally covered. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please take a seat and relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's check your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright. Um… let me see. Okay… I can read the top line, no problem. And the second line… and the third… Oh, I can see down to the fifth line, I think. The sixth line is a little blurry. Is that what you need to know? Do I need glasses to read it better? I usually don’t wear them, except for close work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You can read down to the fifth line, sixth line is blurry. That indicates some mild visual impairment, which we will note. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam is normal; no signs of diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Please sit here. I’ll tap a few places on your knees and elbows.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. I’ve had plenty of check-ups in my life, so I’m used to this. Hopefully, everything is still working properly! I’ve always been a bit clumsy, though, so don’t be surprised if I don’t do perfectly.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Coordination is good. Now, I'm just going to ask you to touch your nose with your finger a few times, and then follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Alright, everything looks good. No obvious neurological deficits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal, aside from slightly elevated blood pressure and mild visual impairment.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. So, what does that mean? Will I get the card? I'm trying to avoid a long process, if possible. I have work to do, you know. I don’t want to have to go to a specialist or anything, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, San. Based on the exam, I can issue a medical certificate for commercial driving, with a few stipulations. The slightly elevated blood pressure and mild visual impairment require ongoing monitoring. I’m going to recommend you follow up with your primary care physician within the next three months to recheck your blood pressure and discuss potential management strategies if it remains elevated. And I’m recommending a follow-up eye exam within the next six months to assess your vision and ensure it remains stable. I will include these recommendations on the certificate. With regular monitoring, you should be able to maintain your driving privileges. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. As long as I can get the card, I’m happy to follow up with the doctors. I will make those appointments. I just want to be legally compliant and get back to work. Three months for the blood pressure and six months for the eyes… I can manage that. So, do I get the paperwork now? Is there anything else I need to do? I really appreciate you getting this done quickly. It’s a relief.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here’s the certificate. It's valid for one year, as long as you adhere to the follow-up recommendations. I’ve also printed out a summary of those recommendations for you. The next step is to submit this certificate to the Department of Motor Vehicles along with your application. You can find more information about the submission process on their website. Do you have any questions about the certificate or the follow-up requirements?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll get this submitted right away and make those appointments. I really appreciate you not making me jump through too many hoops. It's been a good morning, all things considered. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Drive safely! .
