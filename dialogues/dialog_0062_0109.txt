DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, welcome! It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My head… back of head… hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not big pain, but always there. Like… a weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, primarily at the back of your head. You described it as a constant weight… that's helpful. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… not sharp. Not like… bang-bang pain. More… dull. And it doesn’t get much worse when I move. I work… I worked with the trains, you see? Lots of… moving things. But head… still same. Sometimes… little dizzy, but not fall-down dizzy. Just… world move a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a dull, constant ache at the back of the head that isn't really affected by movement. And you’ve noticed some dizziness, but not severe enough to make you feel off balance. You mentioned you used to work with trains – that’s good information. Do you remember anything specific that might have triggered the headache, or any other symptoms that started around the same time?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… no. Just… woke up with it. Maybe a little tired… been a long summer. No… nothing fall or hit my head. And… no fever. Wife… she always check for fever. She… gone now, you see. But I remember. No fever. No… blurry vision. Just the head… and little dizzy. Work hard, maybe? Lots of sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific injury or event that triggered it, no fever, no vision changes. It just started gradually, and you’ve been a bit tired. You worked hard and were in the sun a lot. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, have you ever experienced headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No. Not like this. I get… sometimes a headache when I stressed. But those… they go away when I rest. This one… stays. Like a stone. And… I drink lots of water. Wife… she make me always drink water. So not… not thirsty headache. Different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this headache is different from the typical stress headaches you've experienced in the past—it’s more persistent. That's important to know. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. Please. Check what you need to check. I want this… this stone… to go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. I’m going to gently feel your head and neck to check for any tenderness or muscle tension. I'll also check your reflexes and balance. And I’ll take a listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard part of the exam. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. There is some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, but nothing particularly concerning. Your balance seems a little unsteady, but that could be due to age or simply being a little tired. I'm also going to check your ears. Ears look clear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Wife… she always ask when they give me medicine. Never have allergy. No, no allergy. She… good woman. Always careful. Is… quiet now. But I remember. Medicine… I take sometimes for… old bones. That is all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you take medication for your bones. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… the little white pill. Small. Doctor… before, a different doctor, give it to me. For… make bones strong. I… I don’t know the name. Sorry. Old man… forgetful sometimes. But I take it every morning. Wife… she fill the little box. I just… take the pills. She take care of everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mitchell. It's common to forget medication names. We can look it up if you’d like. Knowing you take something for your bones is helpful. And it's good you've been consistent with it. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No. I eat… I eat what I like. Soup mostly. And sometimes… rice. Wife… she make good soup. No… no change. Maybe… a little less hungry when is very hot. But that is all. Weight… I don’t know. I just… I just eat. Not big man anymore, but not… not losing weight. Maybe a little. But not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant changes in appetite or weight. Given what you’ve told me—the persistent headache, mild tenderness in your neck, slight dizziness, and that you take medication for your bones—I’d like to order a few tests, just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. If you think it is good… then I want the tests. I want to know what is… this stone. I want it to go away. What kind of tests? Is… needles? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. I understand your concern about needles. We’ll try to minimize them as much as possible. I'm going to order a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any other underlying conditions. I also want to get a scan of your brain – a CT scan – just to make sure there's nothing concerning going on there. The CT scan does involve some radiation, but it's a low dose, and it will give us a clear picture of what's happening. We'll also check your blood pressure. The blood test is a simple prick of the finger or arm, and the CT scan is painless; you’ll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Hmm… Pictures… that is good. No needle for pictures? Just lie down? Blood… maybe. Not much blood? Just… little? I… I trust you, Doctor. Do what you think is best. I want this… stone… to go away. Wife… she would want me to get the tests. She… always careful. Yes. Do the tests. But… no big needles, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. You’re right to be concerned, and I assure you, it won't be a big needle. Just a small blood draw. We’ll get that ordered right away. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the process for the CT scan and schedule it for you. It's likely we can get it done today, depending on availability. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild pain reliever—ibuprofen—to help manage the headache. It's available over-the-counter, but I’ll give you a prescription just in case. Would you like a written copy of my instructions and the prescription?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. The paper… good. I forget things. Wife… she always write everything down. The paper… for me. And… thank you. You are… very kind. And… the medicine. For the stone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. Here’s a copy of my instructions, the prescription for the ibuprofen, and a list of potential side effects to watch out for. I'll also have the nurse come in with information about the CT scan. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss a plan moving forward. If the pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms—like fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explained everything… very good. Just… I hope… I hope it is nothing bad. Thank you, Doctor. You… you make me feel… better, just talking to you. Wife… she would be happy you are taking care of me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mitchell. It was my pleasure meeting you as well. We’ll do everything we can to figure this out. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly.
