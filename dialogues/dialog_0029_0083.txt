DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. Well, to be frank, I just need a little… something from you. A card, you understand? A “Get Well” card. Or maybe just a little encouragement. My niece, she thinks it would cheer me up. It’s silly, I know. But she’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: A medical note for encouragement… I see. While I appreciate your niece's thoughtfulness, my role is to address your health concerns, Mr. Kammer. Is there something medically bothering you that you'd like me to take a look at?
PATIENT: Well, now hold on a minute. I am bothered, Doctor. I’m bothered that you're questioning my need! It's just… a little low spirits, you understand? Not everything needs a name and a pill. And frankly, I don't see what's wrong with a doctor being… nice. A card is nice. A little encouragement goes a long way. It’s the principle of the thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. I apologize if I came across as dismissive. It’s not that I don’t believe you're feeling unwell – it’s simply that my training and ethical obligations require me to investigate the cause of those feelings. “Low spirits” can be a symptom of many things, some of which require medical attention. To best help you, even if it turns out to be something minor, I need to ask some questions. Would you be willing to humor me?
PATIENT: Humor you? I suppose. But don’t expect a long story. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Boiler operator. I deal with pressure, not… feelings. But alright. Ask your questions. Just… don’t expect me to understand all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. Let's start with the basics. How long have you been feeling this way – this “low spirit,” as you call it?
PATIENT: Oh, a good while now. A few months, maybe? It comes and goes. It's not like I'm crying all the time, you understand? Just… not as peppy as I used to be. Since the divorce, I guess. It’s been… quiet. Too quiet. But that was two years ago, so I shouldn’t be complaining now, should I?
DOCTOR: A few months, with some ups and downs, and potentially related to the divorce two years ago. Okay. Has anything specific happened in the last few months that might be contributing to feeling this way?
PATIENT: Specific? Not that I can rightly say. Work’s the same. Boiler’s running fine. Niece visits when she can. The supermarket prices are outrageous, does that count? Honestly, Doctor, life is just… life. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. I don't go looking for reasons, you understand? I just… am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like things have been relatively stable, but you're still feeling… off. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, actually. I wake up a lot. Not sick-waking, just… awake. Staring at the ceiling. And the appetite, well, it’s not what it used to be. I don’t crave much, you understand? Used to love a good roast pork, now… it just doesn’t appeal. Energy? I get things done, but I'm tired quicker, maybe. But that could be the age, right? 56 years old, Doctor. Things start to wear down.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point about your age, Mr. Kammer. But changes in sleep and appetite, along with fatigue, can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, my back's been acting up lately. Nothing new there, it always does when the weather changes. And I've been a bit… forgetful, maybe. Not serious, you understand? Just… misplacing things. Keys, mostly. But that's probably the age too, right? It's a lot to keep track of. I mostly just try to ignore it and get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Back pain with weather changes and some forgetfulness. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your mood besides feeling “low”?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Well, I’m not exactly skipping around singing show tunes, Doctor. I'm a bit… grumpy, maybe? I used to be more patient. Now, things bother me easier. But that’s just life, right? People annoy you. Things go wrong. It’s not like I’m having a breakdown or anything. I just… wish things were a bit simpler.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I appreciate your honesty. While it sounds like you’re managing, what you’re describing – changes in mood, sleep, appetite, energy, and some forgetfulness – could be indicative of several things, including depression. I understand you're not keen on labels, but it’s important to rule things out. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam and maybe order some basic blood work just to get a clearer picture?
PATIENT: Depression? Now, hold on just a minute. Depression? I’m a boiler operator, Doctor, not a… a delicate flower. I’ve handled pressure my entire life. Physical exam? Blood work? For what? To find out I'm just getting old? I don’t need a fancy test to tell me that. I came here for a card, Doctor. A little encouragement. Not a diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. You're right. I’m not here to dismiss your feelings or force a diagnosis on you. However, my ethical obligation is to explore potential causes for your symptoms, even if they seem minor. I’m not suggesting you’re delicate, only that changes like these deserve attention. The blood work and a quick exam would rule out other possibilities, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues, which can present similar symptoms. But, if you're truly opposed to it, I respect that. I will say this: I can’t, in good conscience, simply write a note for “encouragement” without at least acknowledging these changes and offering a pathway to potential help. Perhaps we can agree on a compromise. I can write a note stating you’ve been evaluated, we discussed your concerns, and you are currently stable, but further monitoring may be beneficial. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A compromise, you say? Stable… that sounds alright. Better than a diagnosis, I suppose. Further monitoring… I don’t like the sound of that, but… alright. Write your note. Say I'm stable. And say I'm a boiler operator. That's important. And... make sure it’s a nice card, Doctor. Don't give me some flimsy piece of paper. A good, sturdy card. With maybe… a picture of a boiler?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. A sturdy card with a boiler picture, it is. I’ll make a note of your occupation as well. I’ll also document that we discussed your symptoms – changes in sleep, appetite, mood, and some forgetfulness – and you are currently stable, but further monitoring is advised. It’ll take me just a moment to print it out. While I do that, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your boiler. It sounds like you take pride in your work. That’s a good thing, Mr. Kammer. A very good thing.
PATIENT: Well, now, that's kind of you to say, Doctor. It's a Babcock & Wilcox, see? A real workhorse. I've been tending to her for twenty years now. Keeps the whole building warm. You gotta respect a machine that does its job, you understand? Keeps everything running smoothly. It's a responsibility, that boiler. A real responsibility. But a good one. A good one indeed.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Kammer. A card befitting a dedicated boiler operator. I've also printed a summary of our conversation for your records. Remember, if your symptoms worsen, or if you simply want to talk, don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. And take care of that boiler. It sounds like she relies on you. Have a good day, Mr. Kammer.
