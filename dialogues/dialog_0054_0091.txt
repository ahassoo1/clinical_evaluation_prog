DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, is just… I been drinkin’ a lot of water lately. More than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That doesn’t sound quite right at all. Drinking more water and increased hunger can be a sign of several things. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe about a month or so ago? It didn’t come on sudden, is more like it just… build up. First, I notice I was reachin’ for the water glass more often. Then, after I finish a meal, I still feel like I need somethin’ more to eat. Not a big portion, but just… somethin’. Is hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a gradual increase in both thirst and hunger over the past month. And you said after meals you still feel unsatisfied, not necessarily hungry just… not full?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Not proper hungry, is more like… empty. Like the food just pass right through me. And the water, I does drink and drink, and still feel dry. Is strange, Doctor. I never use to be this way. I always enjoy a good glass of juice with me food, but now is water, water, water all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now that you mention it… I does feel tired more easy now. Not like sick tired, but just… weariness. And I does go to the bathroom more often, to pee. Is not painful or nothin', just… more times in the day. I thought it was just the water I was drinkin', but maybe it have somethin' to do with it? I don’t know, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased thirst, increased hunger even after eating, fatigue, and more frequent urination. Those symptoms together are definitely worth looking into. Before we go any further, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t really have much of a medical history, Doctor. I always been a strong woman, never sick much. I had the usual childhood things, measles and so on, but nothin' serious. When I get older, is just the normal aches and pains, but nothing that needed a doctor’s visit. My husband, he does take me to the doctor regular for check-ups, but they always say I is healthy as a horse. I don’t take any medication regular, and I don’t have no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant medical history, no medications, and no known allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. Not even for me tonsils! I always been lucky that way. I does try to eat healthy and stay active, but is hard when you get older, you know? Sometimes me joints does act up, but nothing too bad. I just rub some balm on it and it does ease it up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had high blood pressure when she get older, and my father, he had some trouble with his heart. But they both live a good long life, near eighty years old. My husband’s side, I don’t know them so well. We don’t really see them often. But I don’t think they have any serious sicknesses either, not that I know of. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, thank you. It helps to get a broader picture. Now, could you tell me a little about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up around six o'clock, does a little housework, makes breakfast for me and me husband. He does the gardenin', and I does mostly the cookin’ and cleanin’. We eat lunch around noon, usually somethin’ simple, like soup and bread. In the afternoon, I does visit with me neighbours, we does chat and drink tea. Then I makes dinner, and we watch a little television before bed. I work as a pump operator at the water plant, so I does have to go to work sometimes, but mostly I stay home. Is a quiet life, but I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of your daily routine. And just to confirm, you mentioned you work as a pump operator - is that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Not too demanding, Doctor. Is more like checkin' the machines, makin' sure everything is runnin' smooth. Some liftin' and carryin', but nothin' heavy. I been doin' it for many years now, I does know the plant like the back of me hand. Is not like construction work or nothin', is mostly standin' and walkin'. But lately, I does get tired easier, even after a short shift. That's why I does rest more in the evenin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, relatively low physical demand, but increased fatigue recently. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I want to ask one last question. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, me vision has been a little blurry sometimes, especially in the evenin'. I thought it was just me eyes gettin' old, so I didn't say nothin'. And yes… I think I lose a little weight. Me clothes feel a little looser, but I didn’t really pay it much mind. I thought it was good thing, maybe I was eatin' better. But now that you ask, maybe it wasn’t so good thing after all.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and some unexplained weight loss along with the increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, and fatigue. That's enough information for now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I'll palpate your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. Your blood pressure is 140/90, your pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is everything alright so far? I does get a little nervous when the doctors listen to me chest, you know. My mother always had weak lungs.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds regular as well, no murmurs. Everything sounds good so far, but it's always best to be thorough. Now, I'm going to check your ears, nose and throat. Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. Your nose is also clear. Your throat looks a little dry, but no obvious signs of inflammation. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Ooh, that feels a little tender there… right around here. Not painful, but… sensitive. Like somethin' is… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some tenderness there as well. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes and muscle strength. Could you please extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is everything alright? Me hands does shake a little sometimes, you know. It's just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your muscle strength is slightly weaker than expected, but not significantly. Okay, Bianca. That completes the physical exam. Based on your symptoms – increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, blurry vision – and the findings of the physical exam – tenderness in your upper abdomen, diminished reflexes, and slightly weaker muscle strength – I think it’s important to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a fasting blood glucose test.
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Is it somethin' serious, Doctor? What could it be? I does get scared when I have to do tests. What will they show?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca. It's natural to be worried. These tests aren’t necessarily indicative of anything serious, but they will help us rule out several possibilities and determine the cause of your symptoms. The most common thing these tests will help us assess is whether you have diabetes. The symptoms you're describing – increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, weight loss – are classic signs of diabetes. However, we also need to rule out other potential causes, like kidney problems or liver issues. The blood tests will give us information about your blood sugar levels, kidney function, liver function, and overall health. The urinalysis will help us check for glucose and other abnormalities in your urine. The lab will need a fasting blood sample, meaning you won’t be able to eat or drink anything for 8-12 hours before the test. We can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My auntie Elsie had diabetes. She lost a leg, you know. 8 to 12 hours… that’ll be difficult, I does get hungry easily. But if it’s necessary… yes, tomorrow morning will be alright. Is there anything else I need to know? Will the tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, especially given your auntie Elsie’s experience. However, diabetes is very manageable these days with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Not everyone with diabetes will experience complications like your auntie Elsie. The blood draw itself won't be painful, just a quick pinch. You might feel a slight discomfort afterwards, but it shouldn't last long. As for the results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the lab to get everything back to us. Once we have the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, even though you're feeling thirsty. Avoid sugary drinks and snacks, as they can worsen your symptoms. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like blurred vision, fatigue, or nausea, please let me know immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Just… try not to worry too much, you said? Is that right? I does get anxious easily. And thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. You've been very kind. I'll try me best to fast, and I'll drink plenty of water. I'll see you tomorrow then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. And you're right to be concerned, but try not to jump to conclusions. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Try to relax as much as possible, and focus on taking care of yourself. I'll see you tomorrow morning. We will schedule you for 8:00 AM. It was nice meeting you. Have a good evening, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Nice meeting you too, Doctor. I will try to rest. Thank you again for everything. Good evening to you.
