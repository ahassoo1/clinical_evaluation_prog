DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Honestly, it’s been… a thing. Look, I don’t really have time for a long chat about it, Doc. Just, I feel puffy, alright? Like a balloon. It’s uncomfortable. Can we just figure out what it is and get me sorted?
DOCTOR: “A thing,” alright. Well, even “things” require some detail if we're to… sort them. When did this “puffiness” begin?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? Look, my wife… she passed last year, and things kinda… blurred after that. Dates aren’t my strong suit, okay? It just started happening. Is that good enough? I eat normal, I guess. Nothing fancy. Mostly just… food. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand loss can disrupt many things, Mr. Kristofik. But to determine the cause of your bloating, some specifics are necessary. “Food” is… not particularly helpful. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, normal. Breakfast… toast, usually. Sometimes cereal. Lunch? Sandwich, probably. Dinner… whatever’s easiest. Leftovers, frozen meals… I don’t sit down and plan out a five-course banquet every night, Doc. I’m a pile driver operator, not a chef. It’s not like I'm eating rotten stuff or anything. Honestly, this is a waste of time. Is this going somewhere or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I assure you, this line of questioning is going somewhere, provided you cooperate. While “rotten stuff” is certainly a concern, many perfectly acceptable foods can contribute to bloating. Now, do you notice any particular foods seem to worsen the puffiness?
PATIENT: Particular foods? No! It just… happens. Look, maybe it’s stress? I dunno. Losing my wife, working long hours… maybe my stomach just doesn't like being alive anymore. Honestly, I’m not a doctor. How am I supposed to know what food makes me bloated? It's all just… food! Do you need a list of every ingredient I’ve ever consumed? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try a different approach then. Aside from the obvious distress of your loss, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I feel… tired, okay? I work hard. Anyone would be tired. And… sometimes my stomach gurgles. A lot. It's embarrassing, actually. But it’s just… a stomach, right? Everyone’s stomach gurgles. Look, is there a pill you can give me or not? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and gurgling… We need to rule out some possibilities, Mr. Kristofik. Are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Seriously? You’re asking me about that now? Look, I’m not discussing my… private business with you. This is… inappropriate. I came in for bloating, not a full medical examination. Is there anything you can do about the bloating or not? I’m starting to regret even coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, while I understand your… reluctance, these questions are necessary. Changes in bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, frequency – can indicate a number of underlying issues causing your bloating. I am trying to provide you with the best possible care, which requires a thorough understanding of your condition. Are you able to provide any information regarding this, or shall we proceed with a referral to a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Look, sometimes I have trouble… going. Okay? Constipated. Happy now? But it’s not every day. And sometimes… sometimes it’s the opposite. I don’t know! It changes. It’s a stomach! It does stomach things! I'm a simple man, Doc. Just fix the puffy feeling, alright? I’ve wasted enough time on this already. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Given your symptoms and… limited information, and your desire for a quick resolution, I am going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also check a stool sample for basic infection. These tests will rule out some more serious possibilities. We can also discuss a trial of a low-FODMAP diet, which is often helpful for bloating. However, given the variability you describe and your difficulty providing a clear medical history, I strongly recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for a more thorough evaluation. Do you agree to these tests and referral?
