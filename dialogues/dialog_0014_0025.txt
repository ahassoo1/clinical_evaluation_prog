DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, welcome. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. I want to… find out more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear you can do testing with… spit? To see where people long time ago come from. I want to know more about that.
DOCTOR: Genetic ancestry testing, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That’s it. Genetic… ancestry. Long time ago family. I make little boats, you see. Model boats. But I want to know where I come from, not just build the boats.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Scobie, that’s… not exactly what we do here at the clinic. We’re focused on your health, current medical problems, things like that. We don’t routinely offer genealogical testing. It’s… a bit outside the scope of family medicine.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. So… you no can help me find out about my family? But I hear… people do this now. With the spit, like I say. Is not for sickness, just… knowing.
DOCTOR: There are companies that specialize in that, yes. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing. But frankly, I wouldn’t recommend relying on those results for anything important. They're often… inaccurate, or not very helpful, and can cause more confusion than clarity. It’s not a medical test, so there’s no real regulation, you see?
PATIENT: Regulation? Like… rules? I don’t understand. So the spit test… maybe tell wrong story? But I just want to know… where my people first come from. Not for important, just… for me.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, you’re 85 years old. Your health is what's important right now. Spending money on something that’s… a novelty, frankly, doesn’t seem like a good use of your resources. Have you been feeling alright otherwise?
PATIENT: But… money not so important. I save. I make boats. I want to know my story. It make me happy. Not about sickness, not about money. Just… happy. You no know any place then, that can do this spit test? Maybe a good place? Not trick me?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Scobie, I really don't keep track of those types of services. It’s… not something I deal with. I’m a doctor. We address your health concerns. Perhaps you should ask someone else?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I understand. You no can help. But… maybe you know a good place for old man to get check up? My knees, they ache sometimes. And… I forget things now and then. Maybe you can help with that?
DOCTOR: Alright. That I can help with. Let’s talk about your knees and your memory. When did you first start noticing the knee pain?
PATIENT: Eh… maybe a year ago? Not so bad then. Now… when I walk long ways, it hurt. And getting up from chair… slow. Slow like turtle. And forget… I forget names sometimes. Friends names. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: No falls, Doctor. Not yet. I careful. But… dizzy sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Like… whoosh. Everything spin. Maybe that why I careful?
DOCTOR: Alright. That dizziness is important. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No medicines. I no like them. Make me sleepy. I try to stay strong. I eat fish, you know? Good for brain. And walk a little bit every day, when knees not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Fish, fruit, coconut… everything. I grew up on island, you know? Lots of good food.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we should do a quick physical exam to assess your knees and check your blood pressure, just to rule out anything serious causing the dizziness. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. Slow, but I can stand.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little low, which could explain the dizziness. Heart sounds are… regular. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Ooh… that hurt a little. Not so bad, but… creak. Like old boat. See? Old boat creak.
DOCTOR: There’s some tenderness here on the inside of both knees. And I notice some swelling. It sounds like osteoarthritis. It’s common at your age.
PATIENT: Osteo-what? Is that bad, Doctor? Will I no can walk anymore? Will I no can make boats?
DOCTOR: No, it's not that bad, Mr. Scobie. It just means the cartilage in your knees is wearing down. It causes pain and stiffness. It’s not going to stop you from walking or making boats, but we need to manage it. We can try some simple things first.
PATIENT: Simple things? Like what? No medicines, please. I no like them. Maybe… rubs? Or… exercises? Like swim? I like swim.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can start with physical therapy – exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees. And weight management. Even a little weight loss can make a big difference. As for rubs… topical creams with NSAIDs might help with the pain, but they're not a long-term solution. Swimming is a good exercise, as long as it doesn't aggravate your pain. I’ll write you a referral to physical therapy. If the pain becomes severe, we can discuss other options, but let’s try this first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Physical… therapy. Exercises. No swim if hurt. I can do that. I think. Write me the paper for therapy. And… thank you, Doctor. You help old man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the referral. Call them to schedule an appointment. And try not to overdo it. If you have any worsening pain or dizziness, call the office immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Maybe… one small thing. You know about the spit test? For family? Just… curious. One last question.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, we’ve discussed this. Those tests are unreliable and not medically useful. I really don’t recommend them. I have other patients waiting. I suggest you focus on your health and enjoy making your boats. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I understand. No spit test. Focus on boats. And… knees. Thank you, Doctor. You very busy. I no want to keep you.
DOCTOR: Good day, Mr. Scobie. .
