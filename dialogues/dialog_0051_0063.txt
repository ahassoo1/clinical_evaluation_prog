DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it really hurts. Been hurting bad for a little while now. And… well, you know… about the cancer. It’s just… a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain, and you mentioned… cancer?
PATIENT: Yes. They… the doctors back home, they found some. A long time ago now, but… it’s still there. It's in my… well, they said my bones, mostly. And now this back pain… it feels different. Worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you were diagnosed with cancer some time ago, affecting your bones, and now you're experiencing a change in your back pain… it's become more severe. Can you tell me a bit more about the original diagnosis?
PATIENT: They found it… maybe five years ago? I think. It was in my hip first. Then… other places. They did… tests. Lots of tests. And they said… it spread. It’s… multiple myeloma, I think that’s what they called it. I had treatment back home, but it… stopped working. That's why I moved here, to try and find more help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for sharing that information. That’s very helpful. So, you’ve had treatment for multiple myeloma in the past, but it's no longer effective. And now this new back pain is concerning you. I'm going to pull up your records now, if you don't mind, to get a clearer picture of your previous treatment and the original diagnosis. Just one moment.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good. Take your time, Doctor. No rush. It’s just… this pain is really bad. It makes it hard to… well, to do anything. Even sleeping is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, I’ve reviewed your records. It confirms your diagnosis of multiple myeloma, and it looks like you completed several cycles of treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone. The last treatment was about a year and a half ago. You mentioned the pain is interfering with your daily activities and sleep. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A year and a half. It was okay for a little while after, but then it started coming back. And now… it’s like a… a deep ache. All the time. But it gets worse when I move. Or even when I just think about moving. It feels… like it’s right in my bones. And sometimes… shooting pain down my legs. Not all the time, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. That’s very helpful. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll carefully examine your back to assess the location and severity of the pain, and check your neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on and… if there’s anything that can be done to help. It’s hard to live like this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll do our best to figure things out. Okay, Ms. Meigs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. There's definitely tenderness over your lower back, particularly in the lumbar region. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and your sensation is intact, which is good. However, the limited range of motion and the significant tenderness are concerning. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears your myeloma may be active again, causing bone pain. But, to confirm this, we'll need to order some tests.
PATIENT: That… that makes sense. It feels like it’s getting worse. So… tests? What kind of tests? More poking and prodding? I hate tests. But… if it helps, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Meigs. Tests aren’t always pleasant, but they are necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. We'll need to do some blood work to check your myeloma protein levels, kidney function, and complete blood count. We’ll also need to get an X-ray of your spine to look for any new or worsening bone lesions. And, given your pain and history, I think an MRI of your spine would be helpful to get a more detailed look at the bones and surrounding tissues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, X-ray… MRI… Okay. Yes, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And… if there’s something that can be done. I don’t want to just… live with this pain. So… blood work first?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's start with the blood work. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll draw some samples. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule the X-ray and MRI. I’ll also have my nurse give you a prescription for some pain medication to help manage the discomfort while we wait for the results. We'll take it one step at a time, Ms. Meigs. And we’ll discuss all your options once we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. One step at a time. Thank you, Doctor. Pain medication… that would be nice. So… just go downstairs, and they'll do the blood work? And then… we wait? It's okay. I'm used to waiting. Just… thank you for listening. It helps just to talk about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It was my pleasure. Yes, just take this order downstairs to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are back—usually within a day or two—my nurse will call you to schedule the imaging and a follow-up appointment. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your pain becomes unmanageable. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go do the blood work now. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Meigs. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day.
