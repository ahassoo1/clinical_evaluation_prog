DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a delicate matter, really. I don’t usually discuss these things, you understand. But I suppose I have to. It’s…a discharge. A rather unpleasant discharge. From…down there. My nephew suggested I come, said it could be something serious. He worries too much, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out. It's good your nephew encouraged you to seek medical attention. We'll get to the bottom of this together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…not like a normal flow, if you catch my drift. It's…thicker. And yellowish. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? I didn’t think much of it at first, assumed it was just…something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away, and now it’s…more noticeable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's…uncomfortable. And the smell…well, let's just say it's not roses. I keep myself very clean, you understand. It’s just…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for being so open with me, Jinnie. It sounds like this is causing you quite a bit of worry, and the discomfort and odor are understandably concerning. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Well, I have been a bit more…irritable, perhaps. Not that I’m normally a ray of sunshine, mind you. But my neighbor, Esmeralda, commented that I seemed rather…short with her yesterday. I thought it was just the heat. And…oh, now that you mention it, I’ve felt a little…tired. But I'm 57, Doctor! Tiredness comes with the territory, doesn't it? Nothing out of the ordinary, I assure you. No fever, no pain when…well, you know. Just…the discharge. And the smell. It’s the smell that’s really bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and fatigue along with the discharge. That’s helpful to know. It’s good you haven’t experienced any fever or pain, but those other symptoms can give us more clues. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh dear. That’s a long story. I mostly see my nephew, Luis, when I need anything. He handles all that paperwork, bless his heart. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago now. And I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but I mostly ignore that. I take a little pill sometimes, when I remember. Mostly, I'm quite healthy for my age. I eat well, I walk every day… well, when it's not too hot. And I've never… well, I've never been married, if that's what you're getting at. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Jinnie. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the high blood pressure is helpful. And no, your marital history isn't directly relevant, but it helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I don’t like olives, but that’s not an allergy, is it? And I get a little itchy sometimes when I wear wool, but everyone does. Luis is the one with the allergies – pollen, cats, dust… he’s terribly sensitive. I’ve always been quite robust, myself. No hives, no swelling… nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very simple woman. I eat my paella, I walk my dog, I keep a clean house. That’s all there is to it. Is this discharge something I caught from my dog, do you think? He's a lovely little chihuahua. Very well-behaved.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely that your dog is the source of the discharge, Jinnie, but thank you for mentioning him. It’s good to know you haven't experienced any typical allergy symptoms. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, and could you tell me about any family medical history you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, just that little pill for the blood pressure, like I said. A tiny white one. I can’t remember the name, Luis gets it filled for me. And…let me see…sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. An over-the-counter one. Ibuprofen, I think? As for family…well, my mother had…arthritis, mostly. And her mother…she died very old, of…just old age, I suppose. My father…he had a weak heart, I think. He was a fisherman, very hard life. No one in my family had anything…serious, if you catch my drift. Nothing like this discharge, certainly. It’s very…unseemly, isn't it? I really don’t understand what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and the blood pressure medication. Thank you. It sounds like arthritis runs in the family. Jinnie, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. This will involve an external examination, and I may need to collect a sample to send to the lab for testing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination? A sample? Oh dear. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that, Doctor. It seems…invasive. And frankly, a little embarrassing. I came to see you to get some answers, not to be…prodded and poked. I suppose it’s necessary, but…are you certain there’s no other way? Perhaps a pill, or some sort of cream? I really dislike doctors, you see. Too much…intrusiveness. And I'm a modest woman.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Jinnie. It's perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable with an examination, and I would never proceed without your full consent. Unfortunately, without a proper examination and a sample for testing, it’s very difficult to determine the cause of the discharge and recommend the appropriate treatment. The testing helps us identify if it's a bacterial, fungal, or other type of infection, or something else entirely. It's the most accurate way to get to the bottom of this and ensure you receive the right care. We will, of course, maintain your privacy and dignity throughout the entire process. A chaperone will be present during the exam if you wish, and we will explain each step before we proceed. The exam itself is quite quick, and we'll make sure you are comfortable and covered as much as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: A chaperone…well, that’s something, I suppose. I still don’t like the idea of being…examined. But I suppose if it's the only way to find out what’s going on… My nephew Luis will be furious if I don't get this sorted. He worries incessantly. Alright. Explain it to me. But please be quick. And discreet. And tell me exactly what you'll be doing. I don’t want any surprises. And absolutely no unnecessary…prodding. I have my pride, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. I understand your concerns completely, and I will ensure everything is done with the utmost care and respect. First, I’ll perform a general external examination of the pelvic area. This involves looking at the skin for any signs of irritation or abnormality. Then, I’ll use a speculum – a small, gently opened instrument – to visualize the vaginal area. This allows me to collect a small sample of the discharge for testing. It may cause a slight feeling of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. The entire process usually takes just a few minutes. We'll provide a gown for you to change into and drapes to ensure your privacy. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A speculum… sounds rather unpleasant. And collecting a sample… is it… a lot? I really don’t like the sound of this at all. And what kind of testing? Will it be… invasive? I want to know exactly what you’re sending off to the lab. I don’t want any…surprises. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very distressing. I came here for answers, not…this. And will it hurt? I need to know if it will hurt. I have a very low tolerance for pain.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Jinnie. It’s perfectly natural to feel apprehensive about this. The sample collection involves using a cotton swab to gently collect a small amount of the discharge. It's a very quick and minimally invasive procedure and shouldn’t cause any significant discomfort – perhaps a slight pressure, but not pain. If you do feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we'll stop. The sample will be sent to the lab for a few different tests. We'll test for common bacterial infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, and also for yeast infections. We may also test for sexually transmitted infections, as a precaution, but this is routine procedure. The tests will help us identify the cause of the discharge and determine the appropriate treatment. I assure you, everything will be done with the utmost care and respect. We will explain each step before we proceed, and you are free to stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would you like me to call Luis to come and sit with you during the exam?
PATIENT: Luis… No. He’ll just fuss and worry. It’ll be worse with him here. But… perhaps I should just know what the worst case scenario is. Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. What am I looking at if it is something…serious? I'd rather be prepared than find out later. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is all very upsetting. And what about after? Will I need… medication? Surgery? I have a very busy schedule, you see. I can't be laid up for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It’s good you want to be prepared, and I will be honest with you. Most of the time, the discharge is caused by a common infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. These are usually easily treated with antibiotics or antifungal medication, and the symptoms resolve quickly. However, in some cases, the discharge could be caused by a sexually transmitted infection, which would require a different course of treatment. In very rare cases, the discharge could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or, in extremely rare instances, cancer. However, these are much less common, and we will conduct thorough testing to rule these out. If treatment is required, it will usually involve medication, either oral or topical. Surgery is rarely necessary. We will discuss all of your options and ensure you are comfortable with the plan before we proceed. Would you like me to proceed with the exam, or would you prefer to postpone it and think about it for a while?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s all so… complicated. And unsettling. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. But please, be gentle. And quick. And explain everything you're doing before you do it. And I want the results as soon as possible. I can’t have this hanging over me. And if it is something…serious… I want to know all my options. All of them. Don’t hold anything back. I need to be prepared. And call Luis when it’s over. He’ll be worried sick. Alright. Let’s get it over with. But please, hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. We will proceed at your pace, and I will explain everything before I do it. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to have you lie on the examination table, and I’ll provide a gown and drape for your comfort. Once you’re comfortable, I’ll perform a visual examination and then gently collect a sample. Remember, you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Just take a deep breath, and we'll get through this together. Would you like me to dim the lights a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, dim the lights, please. And hurry. This is… most undignified. And please, tell me exactly what you are doing at every step. Don't just… prod and poke without warning. I need to know. I must know. And please, be quick. I have a paella to make this evening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to visually examine the external area. I’m looking for any signs of redness, irritation, or swelling. I’m simply observing at this point, not touching anything yet. Now, I’m going to gently separate the labia to get a better view of the vaginal opening. Again, I’m just observing at this point. I’m looking for any unusual discharge or abnormalities. Next, I’m going to insert a speculum – it’s a small, gently opened instrument – into the vagina. This allows me to visualize the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus. It may feel a little uncomfortable, a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll guide it in slowly and carefully. Are you feeling any discomfort at this point?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And cold. Please, hurry. And be gentle. It feels… invasive. And please, stop talking so much. It's making me nervous. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. It's… very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. I’m slowing down and will be as quick as possible. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize for making you nervous. I’m now gently collecting a small sample of the discharge with a cotton swab. This will only take a moment. It shouldn’t cause any pain, just a slight sensation of pressure. Okay, I’ve collected the sample. I’m now carefully removing the speculum. Okay, I’ve removed the speculum. You can take a deep breath now. It’s all finished. Are you feeling okay?
PATIENT: Finally. It’s over. That was… very unpleasant. And invasive. I want the results as soon as possible. And please, don’t tell me everything will be alright. Just tell me the truth. I can handle it. I am a strong woman. But I want those results now. And I want Luis to come and pick me up. I don’t want to be alone. And please, a glass of water. I feel faint.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to get you the results as quickly as possible. The sample will be sent to the lab immediately, and we usually have results within 24-48 hours. I’ll personally call you as soon as they are available. I understand you want the truth, and I assure you, I will be honest with you, no matter what the results are. We will discuss all of your options and create a plan that is best for you. Here's some water. Please take a few sips. Luis has been notified and is on his way. Do you want me to stay with you until he arrives?
PATIENT: Yes, please stay. Just… stay with me. This has been… very upsetting. And I don't want to be alone with my thoughts. Just… sit quietly. And please, don't ask me if I'm alright. I’m not alright. But I’ll be… I'll be fine. Eventually. Just… sit with me. And wait for Luis. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I’m here for you. You don’t need to say anything. I’ll just sit with you until Luis arrives. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do for you.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Jinnie. I wish you all the best. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
