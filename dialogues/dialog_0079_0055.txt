DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 74 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-four, though I don't feel a day over sixty. I'm here… well, my daughter suggested I inquire about this… medical marijuana. She says it might help with… things. I must confess, I’m a little skeptical, but I suppose one should be open to possibilities.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, yes. A… growing trend, shall we say. And what "things" specifically are you hoping it will assist with, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's mostly this… discomfort. In my joints, you understand. And the sleep. It’s not terrible, mind you, but it’s… fragmented. I wake up several times a night. It's rather tiresome, really. And honestly, the aches just… linger. My husband says I complain too much, but he doesn’t feel it, does he? I've tried the usual things, you know. Warm baths, a bit of stretching... They help marginally, but not enough to truly make a difference.
DOCTOR: Joint discomfort and sleep disturbance. I see. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s crept up on me, really. Perhaps… five, maybe six years now? It started subtly, a little stiffness after gardening, then a bit more ache after a long walk. It’s become… persistent, shall we say? The sleep issues are a bit newer, perhaps the last two or three years. It’s all rather… inconvenient, frankly. It impacts my bridge club terribly, you know. One needs a clear head for bridge.
DOCTOR: And have you consulted with any other physicians regarding this discomfort and sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. Of course I have. Dr. Abernathy, my general practitioner, prescribed me some… pills. Something for the joints, something for the sleep. They didn't quite do the trick, and they left me feeling rather… foggy. I much prefer to avoid medication if I can, you understand. It's all so… artificial. That's why my daughter suggested this. She reads everything on the internet, you know. Says this marijuana is… natural. Though I still maintain a healthy degree of skepticism.
DOCTOR: And what was the name of the medication Dr. Abernathy prescribed, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now that is a good question. It was… a small, white pill. No, no, that doesn’t help at all, does it? Let me think… I believe one was called… Naproxen? For the joints, perhaps. And the other… oh, honestly, they all sound so similar. Something with a ‘zol’ in the name. For sleep. I simply can’t recall. I stopped taking them rather quickly, you understand. Didn’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. I’m a perfectly healthy woman for my age. A little discomfort, as we’ve established, but nothing… serious. I have a touch of… well, the doctor calls it hypertension, but it's well-managed. A small pill each morning, nothing to worry about. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, twenty years ago now. But that's hardly relevant, is it? Otherwise, I'm quite robust, thank you very much. A healthy diet, regular walks... I pride myself on maintaining my health.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I believe I had a rather unpleasant reaction to some sort of shellfish when I was a child. A rash, I think. It was quite a long time ago, though. And I’ve always been a little sensitive to certain perfumes. They give me a headache. As for medications… no, I don't believe so. Nothing I can recall, anyway. Though, honestly, I try to avoid them whenever possible. They always seem to have such unpleasant side effects.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Doctor, I just told you. The small pill for the hypertension. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. That's it. Just the one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Honestly, I don't take a great deal of medication. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. A healthy diet, regular exercise… those are far more effective, in my opinion. And far less likely to leave one feeling… foggy.
DOCTOR: And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Doctor, really! What kind of question is that? I am a respectable woman! I might have a small glass of sherry with dinner on occasion. A very small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, of course. Helps with digestion. But smoke? Recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I find the very idea appalling. My husband would never allow it. And frankly, I have far too much dignity for such things.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother, God rest her soul, suffered from arthritis, quite severely in her later years. That’s why I'm so concerned about my joints, you understand. And my father had… heart problems, I believe. Though he didn’t take very good care of himself. Always smoking cigars and eating rich foods. A terrible habit. As for other family history… well, it's all rather hazy. My family wasn't one for discussing such things. It was considered… impolite. So, arthritis and heart problems, primarily. Nothing else that I can recall, anyway. It was a long time ago, you understand. And frankly, I try not to dwell on the morbid details.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. But, I suppose if you insist. I do wish doctors weren't quite so… invasive these days. Very well, proceed. But please be gentle. And do try not to take too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t particularly comfortable, was it? Though I suppose it’s necessary. I do hope you're being careful. I’ve always been rather sensitive. And please don't poke around too much. Honestly, these examinations are so undignified. I do hope you find everything to be in order. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you know. A healthy diet, regular exercise… as I’ve already mentioned. It would be rather surprising to find anything amiss.
DOCTOR: “Joints exhibit mild tenderness and limited range of motion bilaterally, consistent with osteoarthritis. No acute inflammatory process is evident. I’ll also check your reflexes and muscle strength.” I assess her reflexes and muscle strength, noting “Reflexes 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Muscle strength 5/5 in all extremities.”
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Physical therapy? Honestly, Doctor! I haven’t got time for physical therapy! And over-the-counter pain relievers didn’t work before, as I already explained. An orthopedist? Good heavens, no! That sounds dreadfully invasive! I simply want to know if this… medical marijuana might provide some relief. My daughter insists it’s a natural remedy, and frankly, I’m willing to try anything at this point. And what sort of “risks” are we talking about? I’m a perfectly healthy woman, you know. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink excessively, and I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I simply want to alleviate my discomfort. Is this medical marijuana safe for someone of my age and constitution? And if so, how quickly might I see results? I have a bridge game next week, and frankly, I’d like to be able to concentrate.
DOCTOR: “Ms. Ranells, while you describe yourself as healthy, it's important to remember that medical marijuana can interact with existing conditions and medications. Potential risks include dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, and changes in blood pressure. In rare cases, it can exacerbate existing heart conditions. Given your history of hypertension, we need to proceed with caution." “Regarding your bridge game, it’s difficult to predict the exact timing and extent of symptom relief. The effects of medical marijuana vary greatly from person to person. It typically takes several days to weeks to see noticeable improvement, and it may not be a complete solution. It is important to understand that it is not a quick fix." “Before I can recommend medical marijuana, I need to review your complete medical history, including any allergies and current medications. I also recommend a baseline EKG to assess your heart health. Are you willing to provide that information?
PATIENT: An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tiresome! I simply want some relief from my discomfort, not a battery of tests! But… very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. My general practitioner has all my records, you can contact Dr. Abernathy. Though I warn you, he’s a rather busy man. And what sort of… form do I need to fill out? I certainly hope it's not too complicated. I’m not particularly adept at paperwork. And will this… marijuana affect my bridge game? I simply must be able to concentrate. It’s a very important game, you know. My partner is relying on me.
DOCTOR: “Here is a medical history form. It’s fairly straightforward. It asks about allergies, medications, past medical conditions, and family history. It's important to be as accurate as possible. It will also require your signature authorizing release of medical information.” “Regarding your bridge game, the effects of medical marijuana can vary. Some individuals experience improved focus, while others experience drowsiness or impaired cognitive function. It's essential to start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use immediately. It is also important not to operate any machinery or drive while under the influence of marijuana.” “I must also inform you that the legal status of medical marijuana varies by state and that it is still considered a Schedule I controlled substance by the federal government. I can provide you with more information regarding the specific regulations in this state.”
PATIENT: Schedule I controlled substance? Heavens! This is becoming increasingly complicated! And legal regulations… honestly! I simply want some relief from my discomfort, not a lecture on the law! “Now, under ‘allergies,’ does ‘perfume sensitivity’ count? And under ‘past medical conditions,’ should I include my gallbladder removal from twenty years ago? Honestly, this is rather overwhelming! And what if I can't recall the exact names of all my medications? Dr. Abernathy isn't always the most organized man, you know. This is all rather… stressful, you know. I simply want to feel better.” “And what sort of dosage are we talking about? I don’t want to become… incapacitated, you know. I have a reputation to uphold at the bridge club!”
DOCTOR: “Yes, perfume sensitivity should be included. And your gallbladder removal should also be listed, as it is a significant past medical event. If you are unsure of the exact names of your medications, provide as much detail as possible, and I will verify with Dr. Abernathy.” “Regarding dosage, that is something we will determine together based on your individual response. We will start with a very low dose and gradually increase it until you achieve the desired effect. It's important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all dosage, and it may take some experimentation to find the optimal amount.” “I must also emphasize the importance of starting with a low dose and avoiding any activities that require mental alertness until you understand how the medication affects you. It's also crucial to inform your partner that you are using medical marijuana, as it may affect your performance. We are aiming to alleviate your discomfort, not to impair your cognitive function.”
PATIENT: “There. That should be everything. Honestly, this is quite a process! And you say we’ll start with a low dose? How low are we talking? I don’t want to feel… out of it, you know. I have a reputation to uphold! My partner, Beatrice, would simply die if I couldn’t concentrate. She’s a terribly competitive woman. “And what sort of side effects should I be aware of? Besides drowsiness and impaired cognitive function, of course. I have sensitive skin, you know. And I’m prone to headaches. I simply want to be prepared. Honestly, this is all rather… daunting. Perhaps I should just stick to sherry, you know. It’s much less complicated.”
DOCTOR: “Yes, I see you’ve completed the form. Thank you. Regarding dosage, we will start with a very low dose, typically 2.5 milligrams. This is a sublingual tincture, meaning it’s administered under the tongue. It’s important to start with a small amount and wait at least two hours before considering a higher dose. “Regarding side effects, besides drowsiness and impaired cognitive function, potential side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, and changes in appetite. In rare cases, it can cause anxiety or paranoia. If you experience any of these side effects, discontinue use immediately. And while it doesn’t typically cause skin reactions, it’s always possible to experience an allergic reaction, so be vigilant. “If you are concerned about the potential side effects, sticking to sherry may be a reasonable option. However, it’s important to remember that sherry is an alcoholic beverage and should be consumed in moderation. “Before proceeding, I need to contact Dr. Abernathy to verify your medical history and EKG results. I will also need your informed consent to prescribe medical marijuana. If everything checks out, we can discuss a treatment plan and schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your response.”
PATIENT: “Contacting Dr. Abernathy… very well. But do hurry, you know. I have a bridge game next week, and I simply must be at my best. And informed consent… is that another form? Honestly! This is becoming quite tedious. “Very well. Do what you must. But if this entire process delays my bridge game, I simply won't be responsible for the consequences. Beatrice is not a patient woman, you know. And I'd rather not risk a falling out over a few milligrams of… tincture. Do hurry, Doctor. Do hurry.”
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: “Dr. Gonzalezperez’ office. How may I help you?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: “That was Dr. Abernathy’s office. He confirmed your medical history and has faxed over your EKG results. Fortunately, everything appears to be within normal limits. He did note some slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing concerning given your age and existing hypertension.” “Based on this information, I believe you are a suitable candidate for medical marijuana. However, it is important to understand the potential risks and benefits before proceeding. Would you like me to explain the informed consent form and discuss a treatment plan?
PATIENT: “Suitable candidate, you say? Well, that’s a relief. Finally, some progress! Yes, please, do explain the form. And the treatment plan, of course. I want to be fully informed, you understand. And do hurry, Doctor. My bridge partner, Beatrice, is not known for her patience.” “Perhaps this isn’t such a terrible idea after all.”
DOCTOR: “This section outlines the potential risks of medical marijuana, including drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and changes in appetite. It also discusses the potential for psychological side effects, such as anxiety or paranoia. It's important to be aware of these risks before proceeding. Please read it carefully and let me know if you have any questions.” “This section discusses the benefits of medical marijuana, including pain relief, improved sleep, and reduced anxiety. However, it’s important to understand that these benefits are not guaranteed, and the effectiveness varies from person to person. It also states that we’ll begin with a very low dosage to minimize any potential side effects.” “This section requires your signature, acknowledging that you understand the risks and benefits of medical marijuana and consent to treatment. If you’re comfortable with these terms, please sign here. Do you have any questions before proceeding?
PATIENT: “Well, it’s all rather complicated, isn’t it? But I suppose every medication has potential risks. And if it can alleviate my discomfort, it’s worth a try. I suppose.” “There. Done. Now, what’s this business about a ‘very low dosage’? And what form will this… medication take? I’m not particularly fond of pills, you know.”
DOCTOR: "It comes in a small dropper bottle. You'll place a few drops under your tongue and hold it there for 60-90 seconds before swallowing. It has a slightly minty flavor to help mask the taste. We’ll start with that dosage and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your response closely." “It’s important to start with a low dose and avoid any activities that require mental alertness until you understand how the medication affects you. It’s also crucial to inform your partner, Beatrice, that you are using medical marijuana, as it may affect your performance at the bridge game. I will give you a written prescription, and the local pharmacy can assist you. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: “Sublingual, you say? And minty flavor? Well, that’s… acceptable, I suppose. But if it affects my bridge game, that’s a serious problem. Beatrice is a formidable opponent, you understand. And I simply must be at my best.” “And what if it doesn’t work? What if I still can’t concentrate? I don’t want to waste my time and money on something that’s ineffective. And will this… medication interact with my sherry? I enjoy a small glass with dinner, you know.”
DOCTOR: “Regarding your sherry, it’s generally advisable to avoid alcohol while using medical marijuana, as it can potentiate the sedative effects and impair your cognitive function. It’s best to abstain from alcohol while you’re adjusting to the medication and monitoring your response. We can discuss this further at your follow-up appointment.” “I will write you a prescription for the tincture, and I will also provide you with a written information sheet outlining the potential side effects and interactions. I recommend starting with a low dose and monitoring your response closely. If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use immediately and contact me.” “I will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response and discuss any concerns you may have. Do you have any final questions before we conclude our consultation?
PATIENT: “Very well. A follow-up appointment in two weeks. And no sherry, you say? That’s… disappointing, but I suppose I can abstain for the sake of my bridge game. And if it doesn’t work, we can explore other options. “I believe that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. And please, be careful with my records. I don’t want any confidential information falling into the wrong hands. My reputation is at stake, you understand.” “Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again for your assistance.”
DOCTOR: “You're welcome, Ms. Ranells. I will ensure your records are kept confidential. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye.”
