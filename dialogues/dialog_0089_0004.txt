DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? Gotta keep up with those, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up and making sure your immunizations are current. That’s good preventative care. Before we get to that, though, let's just go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor lately?
PATIENT: Not really, no. We don’t have a lot of doctors where I am, and honestly, getting time off work is… tricky. I usually just deal with things as they come up. My husband, he goes to the vet more often than I do to a doctor, ha!
DOCTOR: I understand. Access to care can definitely be a challenge, and work commitments make it harder. Okay, so we’ll get a good baseline established today then. Let’s start with any major medical problems you have had in the past – things like diabetes, heart trouble, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had a pretty bad flu a few years back, knocked me flat for a week. And my knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold, but I just put a wrap on them. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. Nothing ongoing, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant flu a few years ago, some knee discomfort, and a childhood wrist fracture that healed completely. No chronic conditions like diabetes or heart trouble. Good to know. Any surgeries at all, ever?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky enough to avoid those, thankfully! I'm not a fan of being cut open, if you can't tell.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Avoiding surgery is a perfectly good goal! Alright, what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mom… she had high blood pressure when she got older, and my dad, he had some trouble with his heart. He worked really hard his whole life, maybe that had something to do with it. My brother’s healthy as a horse, though. Always been strong. Does that help? I don't know all the specifics, to be honest. We weren't really the type to talk a lot about health.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Teah, thank you. History of high blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your father. It's good you’re sharing what you know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes in the spring, with all the pollen, but I don't take anything for it. Just try to stay indoors when it’s bad. No food allergies, no reactions to medicines that I know of. I don’t really have a lot of sensitivities, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal hay fever but no known drug or food allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, mostly. I try to eat pretty healthy, but you know, it's good to have a little extra insurance. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they're really bothering me, but that’s it. Nothing regular, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle... Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My grandma smoked, and it wasn’t pretty. I promised myself I'd never start, and I haven't. My husband smokes sometimes, but not around me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. Nothing heavy. I don’t really drink much, to be honest. Not a big drinker. Mostly just to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking - a glass of wine with dinner. And finally, do you have any concerns about your mental health?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, life’s been… busy. Work's stressful sometimes, you know? And it’s hard seeing family not as much as I’d like. But overall, I’m alright. I’ve got a good husband, good friends. I guess everyone feels a little down sometimes, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t say I’ve been worried or anything. I sleep okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stress with work, missing family, but generally feeling alright, sleeping okay. Alright, Teah, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 138 over 82. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your lungs and ears sound clear, and your thyroid feels normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Heart’s good, huh? I always worry about that one, with my dad…
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds good - regular rhythm, no unusual sounds. It's good you're mindful of your family history, but everything sounds healthy right now. Now, let’s just check your reflexes quickly. Do you have any history of balance issues?
PATIENT: No, no balance issues. I used to be a pretty good dancer, back in the day! Knees aren’t what they used to be, but my balance is still okay.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes, 2+ and symmetrical. And your gait looks steady, no issues with balance. Overall, your physical exam is fairly normal. The slightly elevated blood pressure is the main thing we should monitor. Now, are there any specific concerns you have that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I guess. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Sometimes my hands get a little stiff, especially in the mornings. And I've noticed I'm not sleeping quite as well as I used to. But nothing major. I thought maybe it was just stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stiffness in your hands, especially in the mornings, and some difficulty sleeping. That could be related to stress, but we should also consider other possibilities. Let’s do a couple of simple blood tests just to get a baseline and rule out anything concerning – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. As long as it’ll help figure things out, I’m happy to get it done. Is it a lot of blood? I don't love needles, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a lot. Just a couple of small tubes. And I'm very quick. We can get it done quickly and efficiently. Okay, I’ll write the lab order for you. And then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, a week sounds fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. I'm glad I came in today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I’m glad you came in too. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. They’re very efficient over there. And I’ll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I feel much better knowing we're getting things checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day!
