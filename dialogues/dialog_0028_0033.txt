DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Julie, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Julie, Burdette Julie. And honestly, Doctor… Memmolo, was it? Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Doctor Ronnisha Memmolo. And I assure you, I also have a schedule. But we need to establish why you're here today. Just…tell me what brought you in. Briefly, if possible.
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s…rather upsetting to have to explain. My vision, it’s just…gone. Or nearly. And my hearing…it’s muffled, like there's cotton in my ears. It came on so suddenly. I woke up like this, practically. It’s most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: "Suddenly," you say. Very well. And how long ago was this "suddenly"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates…they all blur together, don't they? Let me think… It was… the day before yesterday, I believe. Yes, the day before yesterday. Though, to be perfectly honest, I wasn’t paying much attention to the calendar. I was preparing for a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Right. So, approximately two days. And were you feeling unwell before this started?
PATIENT: Unwell? Well, one always feels something, doesn't one? I had a slight headache the evening before, perhaps. Nothing to write home about. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. It certainly wasn't enough to warrant a doctor's visit.
DOCTOR: Headache, noted. And anything else accompanying this vision and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see... No dizziness, no weakness. No…funny tastes, or smells. I do feel rather…flustered, if that counts. It's terribly disruptive, not being able to see properly. And I do seem rather tired, now that you mention it. But that's probably just the stress of it all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses? Goodness. I had a bit of a cold last winter, I suppose. A minor sniffle, really. Nothing serious. I certainly didn’t see a doctor about it. I have a perfectly good immune system, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Any changes to your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, bother. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, I believe. And a vitamin D supplement, naturally. But nothing has changed. I’m very careful about my routine. I assure you, Doctor, I'm a very disciplined person.
DOCTOR: And what exactly is this something for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea. The name escapes me. My former husband used to handle all of that. It’s a small white pill, I believe. I’ve been taking it for years. It’s…quite bothersome that you’re questioning my memory, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's important, Mrs. Julie. Let me ask again. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication you take?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t appreciate this line of questioning! I'm a surgeon, for goodness sake! I don't need to memorize the names of every pill I ingest! It was prescribed by a perfectly competent physician years ago, and I've been taking it ever since. I haven’t noticed any…side effects, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, this is all very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a basic neurological exam, then. Close your eyes.
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the time for… exams. But very well. Get it over with. But do hurry.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger with your eyes – do not move your head. Left, right, up, down…and now follow it in a circular motion. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your pupillary response.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is most uncomfortable. It’s…very bright. And I’m rather sensitive to light these days.
DOCTOR: Pupils are sluggishly reactive to light, and tracking is somewhat erratic. Now, I’m going to assess your facial strength. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It’s…difficult to smile when one is feeling so utterly distressed.
DOCTOR: Facial asymmetry noted. Now, stick out your tongue.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is…degrading. I am a surgeon, Doctor, not a performing seal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief examination, and frankly, your inability to provide a complete medical history, I suspect a possible neurological event. A stroke, perhaps. Or something similar. We need imaging – a CT scan, immediately. And I’m going to order a full blood panel, to rule out any underlying causes. I'll have the nurses arrange transport to the hospital. Don’t delay.
PATIENT: A stroke?! This is absurd! I feel perfectly…well, aside from the vision and hearing, of course. And you haven’t even asked me about my luncheon guests! Honestly, I think I need a second opinion. This is… preposterous. .
DOCTOR: .
