DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Neppl. The pleasure is all mine. I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An endoscopic test, I believe it was called? It said something was abnormal, and frankly, it’s been weighing on my mind. I was hoping you could explain what it all means.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. I’m happy to help clarify those results for you. An endoscopic test, also known as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD, allows us to visualize the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Let me access the report here… Ah, yes. It indicates some mild inflammation in the antrum of your stomach, and a small polyp was identified. To start, could you describe any symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Inflammation… and a polyp. Symptoms… well, that's a good question. I suppose I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, but I attributed it to my age, honestly. A bit of indigestion now and then, particularly after meals. Sometimes a slight burning sensation, but nothing terribly severe. And… oh, I’ve felt a little more tired than usual, but again, who doesn’t at my age? Is that related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Those symptoms – the indigestion, burning sensation, and fatigue – are certainly things we should investigate further, Ms. Minatra. It’s good you’re bringing them to my attention. Could you describe the indigestion in more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… not a sharp pain, more of a discomfort, really. A fullness, a bloating feeling, especially after I eat. It doesn’t happen every time, but often enough to be bothersome. And it doesn't radiate anywhere, it's just… there, in my upper stomach. It sometimes keeps me from enjoying my meals, which is a shame. I do find it’s worse with richer foods, if that makes any sense – things with a lot of fat or spice.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Ms. Minatra. The fact that it's related to richer foods does give us some clues. And you mentioned it doesn't radiate – meaning the discomfort stays localized to your upper stomach – that's also good to know. Now, let's talk about the polyp identified during the endoscopy. Do you have any family history of stomach polyps or stomach cancer?
PATIENT: That's a… a very serious question, Doctor. Family history… my mother, bless her soul, she passed away quite young, from something else entirely. No, I don't recall anyone ever having stomach problems like that. My father was… a very stoic man. He didn’t talk much about his health, and I don't believe I ever knew any of his relatives well enough to know their medical histories. So, no, I don’t think so. But… honestly, I can't be certain. It was a very long time ago, and we weren’t a family that discussed these things openly. Would a biopsy have been taken of the polyp during the test?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Minatra. Family histories aren't always readily available. And yes, a biopsy was taken of the polyp during the endoscopy. The report indicates it was sent to pathology for analysis. …Ah, here we are. The pathology report shows the polyp is a hyperplastic polyp. These are generally benign, meaning non-cancerous, and very common. However, because of its location, and to rule out any possibility of dysplasia – which is precancerous changes – we do recommend a follow-up endoscopy in 3 to 5 years. Now, regarding your symptoms – the indigestion and fatigue – while the polyp seems to be benign, those symptoms warrant further investigation. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Benign… that’s… reassuring. A follow-up in a few years sounds reasonable. As for medications… let me think. I take a low-dose aspirin, prescribed by my general practitioner for… well, just general health, you know? And occasionally, if I have trouble sleeping, I’ll take an over-the-counter sleep aid. But that’s it. Nothing regularly, except the aspirin. I try to manage things naturally as much as possible. Is the aspirin potentially causing the symptoms, do you think?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Minatra. And yes, the aspirin could be contributing to your symptoms. Aspirin, even in low doses, can sometimes cause irritation to the stomach lining, leading to indigestion and, in some cases, even fatigue due to minor blood loss. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia – which could be related to the aspirin – and a stool test to check for Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori is a bacteria that can cause inflammation of the stomach lining and contribute to similar symptoms. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool test. Yes, absolutely. I trust your judgment. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I'm not terribly fond of providing samples, if I’m honest, but if it's necessary, it's necessary. Will the clinic provide the necessary… containers? And is there anything special I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. I completely understand. We'll provide everything you need for the stool sample – the containers and detailed instructions on how to collect it. It’s a fairly straightforward process. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drink except water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning. We'll also need a brief review of your past medical history. Do you have any known allergies, and have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Alright, fasting until tomorrow. I can manage that. Allergies… I have a slight sensitivity to dust, nothing severe, just a bit of sneezing. And surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman, a very long time ago. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy in my early forties. But other than those two, nothing else that I can recall. No known drug allergies, either. I generally tolerate medications well. Is there a form I can fill out with this information, perhaps? It might be easier than trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Minatra. And yes, we have a medical history form you can complete at your convenience. It will cover all of these details and allow us to have a more comprehensive understanding of your health. While you're completing that, I'll finalize the orders for the blood test and stool test. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications that might help alleviate your symptoms, such as avoiding spicy foods, eating smaller, more frequent meals, and elevating the head of your bed at night to prevent acid reflux. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That's very thoughtful, Doctor. The form is helpful, thank you. And those lifestyle suggestions sound reasonable. I've always suspected spicy food wasn't doing me any favors. No, I think that covers everything for now. You've been very thorough, and I feel much better informed. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Just let me know when and where to go for the blood test, and I'll get that arranged.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. The lab is located just down the hall, and the receptionist will be happy to assist you with scheduling. They're open until 5:00 PM today. Once we have those results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as severe abdominal pain, black or tarry stools, or vomiting blood – please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
