DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s Courtnye, by the way. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just… a lot more than usual, and I’m on that blood thinner, you know, to prevent clots. It’s worrying me a bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you are prescribed warfarin. And you’re saying the bruising is… more extensive than what you typically experience with the medication?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Like, I bump into things sometimes, normal stuff, and usually it’s just a little mark. But lately… it’s like black and blue all over my arm just from, honestly, barely touching it. It feels weird, too. Not exactly painful, but… sensitive. It's happened a couple of times in the last week.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when you say "a couple of times," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… okay, last Tuesday I just brushed against the corner of the kitchen counter, and my forearm puffed up right away. Then, on Thursday, I was carrying a grocery bag, and I guess it shifted, and my upper arm got a big bruise. And then yesterday… just reaching for something in the cupboard, a little one on my leg. So, three times in, like, six days. That’s not normal for me, even with the warfarin.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. I’m tired, but I’m always a little tired. And maybe a bit more achy than usual, but I thought that was just the heat. Nothing major, honestly. No nosebleeds or anything like that. Just the bruising.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: No, no falls. Definitely not. I'm pretty careful. I just… bruise easily, now. It’s not like I’ve tripped or anything. It’s just… appearing out of nowhere, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I want to take a look at these bruises, check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure when someone on warfarin reports increased bruising. Can you please roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go. I just... I really hope it's nothing serious. It's just a bit unnerving, you know? I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. These bruises are… fairly significant in size and distribution. Palpation reveals some tenderness, but no evidence of hematoma formation. Blood pressure is 130/80, heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm going to check your ankles now, to see if there is any swelling. No edema noted. Now, tell me, have you changed anything in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I've been eating pretty much the same. Lots of greens, trying to be healthy, you know? I haven't started taking any new vitamins or supplements or anything like that. I haven't even had any more grapefruit juice, I know that’s a thing with blood thinners. I had a little extra pineapple last week, but that’s about it. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: Pineapple won't interfere with warfarin, but I have to ask. Are you taking your medication as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yes! Absolutely. Every single day, same time, 6 PM, right after dinner. I set an alarm on my phone. I’m very careful with it. I know how important it is not to miss doses. I had a scare a few years back, and I don’t want to repeat that! Honestly, that’s why I’m so worried now. It’s not like I’ve been forgetting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your consistent medication adherence, and lack of dietary changes, we need to investigate this further. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a PT/INR to assess your current coagulation status. We'll also check your liver function tests, as liver issues can sometimes affect clotting. I want you to get these labs done today, if possible. Do you know where the closest lab is to you?
PATIENT: Okay, labs… yes, that makes sense. I mean, if it’s not something I’m doing wrong, it must be something inside me, right? Um, let me think... there's a LabCorp on Main Street, about ten minutes from here. I’ve been there before, actually. Would they need an order from you?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m faxing the order to them now. They will likely draw blood, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity or situations where you might be prone to injury. And if you experience any signs of excessive bleeding – prolonged nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, unusual bruising, or any sudden weakness – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No strenuous activity, watch for bleeding, go to the ER if anything weird happens. It’s a lot to keep track of, but I will. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking this seriously. It’s just… scary not knowing what's going on. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: For now, we'll rely on the lab results to guide our next steps. I will review them as soon as they're available and contact you to discuss the findings. It’s likely a minor adjustment to your warfarin dosage, but it’s best to be thorough. I'll also send a copy of the results to your primary care physician for their review. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. I just… I really hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you again, Doctor. I’ll get the labs done right away. I’ll just wait for your call, then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Ms. Hainley. And again, if you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.
