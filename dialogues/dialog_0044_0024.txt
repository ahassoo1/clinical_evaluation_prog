DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I need a letter, actually. It confirms I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, for an airline. They require it before I book a ticket. It’s a bit of a long story, but my husband… he passed away recently, and there were some… complications with getting travel insurance sorted out. They just need official confirmation from a doctor that I'm cleared to travel, health-wise.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Kiante. That must be incredibly difficult. A letter confirming your fitness to fly is certainly something I can help with. To do that properly, I just need to get a little more information. It’s standard practice, you understand – just to make sure everything is safe and appropriate. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your health history and how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please, ask whatever you need to. I understand completely. I want to make sure everything is safe, too. I'm pretty healthy, generally. I haven't had any major problems, thankfully. But… things have been stressful, naturally. So, ask away.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally healthy. Stress can certainly impact things, so it’s good you acknowledge that. Let's start with the basics. Could you tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I don’t have any diagnosed conditions. I have Medicare, and they haven’t flagged anything in my regular check-ups. I get a bit of lower back pain sometimes, from… well, just life, I suppose. But it’s nothing serious. Over-the-counter pain relievers usually do the trick. Nothing that would stop me from flying, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No diagnosed conditions and just occasional lower back pain, managed with over-the-counter medication. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual childhood things – tonsils out when I was little, but that was a long time ago. Nothing recently, or anything major. I remember the recovery being… unpleasant, but that's about it. It was before we moved here, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries besides childhood tonsillectomy. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father… he had some issues with his heart, I think. It wasn’t anything major, but he did have to see a cardiologist a few times. He lived to be 82, though, so it didn’t seem to slow him down too much. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No cancer on either side of the family, thankfully. Does that help? It's a bit hard to remember everything precisely.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Kiante. High blood pressure in your mother and some heart issues in your father – good to know. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for the back pain, like I said. And a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. I really try to avoid taking anything unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to let my body do its own thing, if that makes sense. I don't have a fancy routine or anything, just the basics.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. I can eat anything, take most medications… I’ve never had a reaction to anything, so I don’t worry about it. It’s one less thing to keep track of, I suppose. My husband, on the other hand, had a pretty bad shellfish allergy, so he had to be careful. But I’m good. No worries there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Have you been feeling any unusual symptoms lately – anything like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or anything else that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been a bit… tired, maybe, but that's probably just the stress of everything. And I haven't been sleeping as well as usual, but again, I think that's the situation, not my health. Nothing physically wrong, just… emotionally drained. I’m functioning normally, just… not at my best. Does that make sense? I don’t want to seem like I’m complaining, I just want to be honest.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Kiante. It’s completely understandable to feel tired and have trouble sleeping after a loss. It’s good you’re being honest about how you’re feeling. Alright. Just to be thorough, and to make sure everything is okay before I write that letter for you, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I want to make sure everything is okay, and I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I’d be grateful for the peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128/76 mmHg. And I’ll just quickly take a look at your ears and throat. Ears are clear bilaterally. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling noted. Everything sounds good, Kiante. No immediate concerns detected.
PATIENT: That’s a relief to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I was starting to worry I was imagining things. It’s just… a lot to process, I suppose. So, do you think you can write that letter for me then? About being cleared to fly? That would be wonderful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and check everything. It's put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiante. Given your history and the findings of the exam, I'm happy to write a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel. It will state that you have no known medical contraindications to flying and that your physical exam today was within normal limits. I'll include a statement about the recent loss you've experienced and that any fatigue you're feeling is likely related to stress and grief, and does not pose a risk to air travel. Here you go. Please read through it and let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add or change. I’ll also have a copy added to your chart. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Kiante?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. Yes, this is perfect. Exactly what I needed. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders. No, I think that's everything. I really appreciate your kindness and understanding. You’ve been very helpful. I’m sure you have other patients waiting. I won't take up any more of your time. Thank you again, Dr. Asami.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. If you find yourself struggling with grief, there are resources available, and I’m happy to provide some information if you’d like. Have a safe trip, and please accept my deepest condolences once again for your loss. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate that. I might take you up on the resources, actually. It’s kind of you to offer. Goodbye. And thank you again for everything. .
