DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… pleasant to meet you as well. I suppose. I’m here because… well, it's my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. I don’t like it, and I thought I should get it checked. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s certainly wise to get things checked out when you’re experiencing difficulty breathing. A month is a reasonable amount of time to notice a change. “Difficulty” can mean a lot of things, though. Could you describe what it feels like when you try to lie flat?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a pain, exactly. More like… a tightness. In my chest. And I feel like I can’t get enough air. Like something is… pressing down. I usually have to sit up, or prop myself up with pillows. Then it gets better. It’s… unsettling. I haven’t changed anything in my life, haven’t been doing anything different. I eat the same things, sleep the same hours. It just started.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness in the chest with a sensation of not getting enough air, relieved by sitting up. That's helpful information. And you haven't noticed any other changes in your routine or diet?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I’ve been trying to think about it, really concentrating, but no. Same breakfast every morning - oatmeal. Same supper. I walk to the library three times a week, like always. I haven't been sick, no cough, no fever. Just… this breathing. It's very… inconvenient. I’m a very regular person, Doctor. I like my routine.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is good to know you maintain such a consistent routine. Let’s explore this further. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… No, not that I've noticed. They might be a little puffy sometimes, but I always thought that was just from the heat. It’s been quite warm lately, hasn't it? I don’t think they’re swollen, not really. I’ve never had any trouble with swelling before.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness, perhaps when you're getting up from a chair or bed?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. Not often, but a few times when I stand up quickly, I get a little… woozy. It passes quickly. I just hold onto something for a moment. I figured it was just my age. It hasn’t been a big problem, just a little unsteady feeling. Nothing that's made me fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brief unsteady feeling when standing quickly. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about any other medical conditions you may have, or have had in the past. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. My doctor back home, Dr. Abernathy, he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years ago, but he put me on a… a small white pill. I took it for a while, then he said it was okay to stop. I haven’t seen him in a long time, though. Moved here, you see. And I had a touch of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. And my gallbladder, they took that out. But nothing else that I can recall. Really. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That's helpful information. So, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, pneumonia many years ago, and a gallbladder removal. Do you happen to remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. It was… a small, white pill. Round, I think. I really don't remember the name. Dr. Abernathy just told me what to take. I don’t usually bother with remembering names of pills. I just take them as prescribed. I'm not very good with medications, honestly. It all just seems… confusing. It was years ago, you see. A long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to forget medication names. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Every morning with my oatmeal. And… sometimes I take an antacid, if I eat something spicy. But that’s it. Really. Just the multivitamin and the occasional antacid. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you see. They never seem to do much good anyway. And I’m very careful about what I eat. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin daily and antacids as needed. And you've mentioned no known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. None that I'm aware of. Never had any trouble with allergies. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, and she had all sorts of flowers and plants, and I never had any reactions to any of them. I eat most things, although I don't care for beets. But that's just a preference, not an allergy. I'm a fairly sturdy person, Doctor. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele, that’s very good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have my lunch date with Mildred after this, you see. She makes a lovely tuna salad. But yes, you may listen and check. Just… be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will be as gentle as possible. If you'd like, you can sit up on the table for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. Heart sounds are regular, but I do note a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but something to keep an eye on. Breath sounds are slightly diminished at the bases of both lungs. I notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles when I press on them, which is mild. Everything seems relatively stable, but the elevated blood pressure, the slight murmur, and the diminished breath sounds and mild swelling in your ankles are things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Elevated and diminished and mild… Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I don’t want any trouble. I just want to be able to lie down comfortably. And I have that lunch date with Mildred. What does it mean?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Vanderwiele. Let’s not jump to any conclusions. “Complicated” isn’t necessarily the right word, but it does mean we need to gather a bit more information to understand what’s going on. The elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should. The diminished breath sounds suggest there might be some fluid buildup in your lungs, which could explain the difficulty breathing. The mild swelling in your ankles could be related to that, or it could be due to gravity. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A chest X-ray to look at your lungs, an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh. More things. Well, I suppose it’s better to know, isn't it? Though I don’t like being poked and prodded. And I’m not very good with waiting for results. It makes me anxious. But yes, Doctor. You may order the tests. Just… tell me how long they’ll take. And if they’ll hurt. And if they’ll interfere with my lunch date with Mildred.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Vanderwiele, and I’ll do my best to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. The chest X-ray is painless and takes only a few minutes. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest and limbs; it doesn’t hurt, but it can be a little uncomfortable. The blood work will require a small sample of blood, and that might sting for a moment. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll have the lab send them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will contact you as soon as we have them. As for your lunch date with Mildred, the tests shouldn’t interfere with it. They can be done quickly, and you should be able to go about your day as usual afterward. In the meantime, I'd like you to try and elevate your legs whenever possible, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… and no strenuous activity. That sounds manageable. Though I do enjoy my walk to the library. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… please make sure my nurse calls me quickly. I don't like waiting. And tell her to speak slowly. I sometimes have trouble hearing. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It's still unsettling, but I feel a little better knowing what's going on. And if you'll excuse me, I really should be going. I wouldn’t want to be late for Mildred.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will make sure your nurse is aware of your preferences and will contact you as soon as the results are available, speaking slowly and clearly. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Please take care, and enjoy your lunch with Mildred. If you experience any worsening of your breathing or develop any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Have a pleasant day. .
