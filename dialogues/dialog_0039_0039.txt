DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My regular doctor – old Doc Hemlock, bless his soul – he retired, you see. And the new place sent me over here with a note about my cholesterol being a bit high. That’s what this is about, I reckon. Just wanted to get it checked out, make sure it wasn’t anything to worry too much about.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that note here as well. Cholesterol, alright. Thank you for letting me know. Old Doc Hemlock, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doc Hemlock. Been going to him for… oh, goodness, nearly forty years. A good man. Real shame he decided to hang up his stethoscope, but he deserved a rest. He always said I was a healthy fella, though. Always active, you know? Still do a bit of gardening, a little fishing… never really slowed down. That’s why this cholesterol thing surprised me, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you've been so active! It's good to stay busy. And it is good you're getting this checked out, even if you feel well. Sometimes cholesterol can be high even with a healthy lifestyle. Do you remember what Doc Hemlock said exactly about your numbers?
PATIENT: Hmm… numbers. That’s where my memory gets a bit fuzzy, to be honest. He mumbled something about… well, I think he said it was a little over 200, maybe? And something about the “bad” cholesterol being a bit high, and the “good” cholesterol being a little low. He wrote a prescription for something, but I didn’t end up filling it. Thought I’d get a second opinion first, you see. Always good to be sure, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, a second opinion is always wise. It’s good you’re thinking things through. So, around 200… that's a good starting point. We'll need to do a blood test here to get accurate numbers, of course. Now, besides the cholesterol, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. Feeling pretty much the same as always, I’d say. Maybe a little more tired some days, but that could just be the heat, you know? It’s been a scorcher this summer. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. Appetite's good, sleep’s okay… Just the usual aches and pains of an old man, ha!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It's helpful to know you aren't experiencing any new symptoms. And yes, this heat is something else! Okay, let's talk a little bit about your overall health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Doc Hemlock always said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago, but it wasn’t bad enough for medicine. Just told me to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, not really. I had the mumps as a boy, chickenpox, the usual childhood things. Had a bit of trouble with my knee a few years back, needed a little physiotherapy, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, ever. My father had a weak heart, though, if that matters. He passed away when he was 72.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. And yes, family history is important. A weak heart in your father… we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes, actually. Back in ’78, I had my appendix taken out. And then, a little later on, I had a hernia operation. Both went fine, no problems whatsoever. Nothing since then, though. A long time ago now, both of them. Seems like a lifetime ago!
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix and hernia… good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Not really. Just a little aspirin every now and then for my joints, if they're acting up. And sometimes, a little something for my heartburn, but that’s infrequent. Nothing regularly, no. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, if you know what I mean. Always worried about side effects.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's wise to be cautious. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife, bless her soul, she was allergic to bee stings, but I never had any trouble myself. I can eat just about anything, drink just about anything… lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at you generally. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've been poked and prodded by doctors enough times in my life, ha! Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bohnett. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Nothing terribly concerning right now, but we’ll want to monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit of a murmur. Often harmless in older individuals, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good and strong in all extremities. Let's just take a look in your ears. Ears look clear. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Now, to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels, I'm going to order a blood test. It's just a standard panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A blood test is fine. Just let me know when and where I should go to get it done. And thank you for being so thorough. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit already.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’re open until 5 pm today. You don’t need an appointment, just tell them Dr. Kamahele sent you for a cholesterol panel. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Room 203, cholesterol panel. I can manage that. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man ramble on. I think I’ll go do that blood test right now, before I forget.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to come back if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and be careful on your way to the lab.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
