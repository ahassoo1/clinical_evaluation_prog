DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about these… moments. I don’t know how to explain it nicely. My wife, she says I’ve been… not myself. Forgetting things, mostly. And sometimes, I just… get lost in my head, I suppose. It's very frustrating. I’ve always had a good memory, you understand. A very good memory. So this is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, we’ll try to get to the bottom of it. "Moments," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, moments. Like… yesterday, I was fixing the tiles in the bathroom – simple work, I’ve done it a thousand times – and I couldn’t remember which way the pattern went. The pattern. I had just laid the first few, and… nothing. Blank. My wife had to remind me. She says it’s been happening more and more. It’s not like I’m senile, you know. I’m perfectly capable. I just… have these little lapses. And it’s not just tiles. Sometimes I struggle with names. Not important names, thankfully. Just… people I see around the neighborhood.
DOCTOR: "Little lapses," alright. And how long have these lapses been occurring, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? It started slowly, I think. I noticed I was double-checking things more often. Then it became more frequent. My wife really started noticing about three months ago, I’d say. She’s very observant, my wife. Always has been. Though sometimes she exaggerates. She tends to make a mountain out of a molehill, you know? But even I have to admit, it’s been happening more often lately. It's just... not right.
DOCTOR: Three months, consistently. And these lapses... do they happen at specific times of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. It seems… random. Sometimes it’s first thing in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon when I’m working. Yesterday, it was mid-afternoon, like I said, with the tiles. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything specific. Though… now that you mention it, I do feel a bit more… foggy after a long day of physical work. But I've been doing that work for forty years! It shouldn't make me forget something as simple as a tile pattern. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my wife says I've been a bit more… irritable. Which is nonsense, of course. I've always been a direct person. But she says I snap at her more easily. And… I suppose I have been a bit more tired lately. Not just from the work, but… a general fatigue. It’s hard to explain. I sleep fine, but I don’t wake up feeling… refreshed. And my appetite has been a little off. Not much of an appetite, really. But I still eat. Just not as much as usual. Though, truthfully, I’ve never been one for large meals.
DOCTOR: Irritability, fatigue, decreased appetite… Okay. Now, let’s go through some medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a bad back a few years back, but that’s all been sorted. High blood pressure, the doctor told me, but it's controlled with medication. Just a small pill, every morning. And… that’s about it, really. I’ve always been a healthy man. Good genes, I think. My father lived to be ninety-five. A very strong man, my father. He never complained about a thing. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, back problems, controlled hypertension. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s just for general health, really. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my back is acting up, I take ibuprofen. But not often. Mostly just when it rains, you know? The dampness gets to it. I always try to avoid taking pills if I can. They just… mess with your system, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just… seasonal. Nothing serious. I can eat anything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I remember my brother, he was allergic to penicillin. Terrible rash, he had. But me? No. I’m a strong man. I can handle anything. Although… my skin gets a bit itchy sometimes after I use certain cleaning products. But that’s probably just a sensitivity, not an allergy. Really, I don’t have any allergies to speak of. It’s a blessing, really. Some people have so many sensitivities, it’s terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Any history of dementia, Alzheimer's, or other neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My mother… she was a bit forgetful towards the end, but we just put it down to old age, you know? She lived to be eighty-eight, which is a good age. And my uncle, on my father’s side… he had some sort of… shaking. But it wasn’t Alzheimer’s, I don’t think. Just tremors. He was a carpenter, and they said it might have been from the sawdust. It’s hard to say, really. No one ever talked about it much. We didn’t have doctors back then like we do now. It was all… hushed tones and assumptions. I don't recall anyone officially diagnosed with dementia, no. A bit of forgetfulness here and there, but nothing serious. My father was as sharp as a tack right up until the end. A very clever man, my father.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Goodness, no. Never touched a thing in my life. My father would have had a fit. Always said it was a waste of time and money. As for alcohol… I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just red wine. For my health, you understand. The doctor says it's good for the heart. Just one glass. Never more. And I used to smoke, years ago, when I was younger. But I gave it up twenty years ago when my wife got pregnant. Best thing I ever did. Never touched a cigarette since. I’ve always been a sensible man. A moderate man. And I try to live a healthy lifestyle. Though these little lapses… they’re very unsettling, you understand. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for that detailed information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m not afraid of a little examination. Just get to the bottom of this, you know? These moments are… worrying. I’m a practical man, I like to know what’s going on. And I’m not getting any younger, so it’s best to be thorough. Just don't poke too much, alright? My back’s been a bit sensitive lately. But go ahead, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… please be quick. I have tiles to lay, you know. A man’s gotta work.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. I'll start with your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to do a quick cognitive assessment. I'll ask you a few simple questions. Just answer as honestly as you can. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? August… the second. August the second, 2025. Yes, that’s right. August the second. Though… wait, is it the second? Perhaps it's the third. No, no, it’s the second. I’m sure of it. August the second, 2025. It feels right. It has to be the second. I just… I’m a bit distracted, you see. All this talk about lapses… it’s playing on my mind. But yes, August the second, 2025. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: The President… now that's a tricky one. I… I used to follow politics more closely. But these days… It’s… Biden. Yes, Biden. Joe Biden. Is that correct? It feels… uncertain. There’s been so much going on, you see. I just can't seem to keep track of everything these days. But yes, I believe it’s Joe Biden. Is that right? It should be right. I just… I'm not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Remember them, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them after me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Yes, I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. It’s… a bit silly, isn’t it? Asking me to remember three words. But alright, I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. I'll try my best to remember them. Though… I’m not making any promises, you understand. My mind isn’t what it used to be. But yes, apple, table, penny. There. I've said them. Now, what next?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year? Really? I just told you the date. It's… 2025. Yes, 2025. Surely, I remember that. It’s the year… well, it’s the year we’re in, isn’t it? It’s… a bit insulting, asking me these obvious questions. I may be having a few lapses, but I’m not completely senile. Yes, 2025. Definitely 2025. Is that satisfactory? I just… I wish you'd get on with it. I have work to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you spell the word “world”?
PATIENT: Spell “world”? Goodness gracious. This is ridiculous. I haven't had to spell anything in years. W… O… R… L… D. Yes, W-O-R-L-D. World. Is that correct? It feels… forced. I'm a tile setter, not a schoolboy. Honestly, this is… W-O-R-L-D. There. I’ve spelled it. Can we please move on? I’m starting to feel quite flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as ten past eleven. Just a simple sketch is fine. Here's a piece of paper and a pen.
PATIENT: Draw a clock? Goodness. I haven’t drawn anything since… well, I can’t even remember. There. It's not very good, I must admit. I’m a practical man, not an artist. But I’ve drawn a clock, showing… approximately ten past eleven. It’s the best I can do. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. Is this going to tell you what’s wrong with my memory? It seems rather… pointless.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you. That’s all for the physical exam for now. Based on my initial assessment, you’re exhibiting some mild cognitive impairment. Your short-term memory appears to be affected, and the clock drawing test suggests some difficulties with visuospatial skills. The questions weren’t easy, but the pattern of errors is… concerning. However, it’s too early to make any definitive diagnosis. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. They can perform more specialized tests, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work? A neurologist? MRI? Goodness gracious. It sounds… serious. I just came in here because I forget things sometimes! It’s not like I have dementia or something. It's probably just stress. Or maybe it’s the wine. I don’t know. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. A neurologist… what will they do? Poke around in my brain? No, I don’t like the sound of that at all. I don’t know… I need to think about it. I need to talk to my wife. This is… a lot to take in. Is it absolutely necessary? Maybe it’s just a vitamin deficiency. Or… I don’t know. I’m not sure I want to go down that road.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. However, it's important to rule out any serious underlying causes for these symptoms. While a vitamin deficiency is possible, it’s not the most likely explanation given the pattern of deficits we’ve observed. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can help us identify any structural abnormalities in the brain. It doesn't involve poking around, as you put it. And a neurologist is a specialist trained in diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders. I strongly recommend at least getting the blood work done. It's a relatively simple procedure that can provide valuable information. We can then discuss the results and decide whether or not to proceed with a referral to a neurologist. Ignoring these symptoms won’t make them go away, and early detection is crucial for optimal management. What do you say?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Blood work, fine. I suppose I can manage blood work. But that’s all. No neurologists, no MRIs, not yet. Let’s see what the blood work says. If it’s just a vitamin deficiency, then this whole thing is a waste of time. And I don’t want to go poking around in my brain if it’s not necessary. But I’m telling you, I’m a practical man. I need to be able to work. I have tiles to lay. And I don’t want any unnecessary tests or procedures. Just the blood work, alright? And then we’ll see. When will I get the results? And what exactly will they be looking for? Is it something serious? I need to know. I really, really need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand. We'll start with the blood work. I've written a requisition for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 and D levels. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions or deficiencies that could be contributing to your symptoms. You can get these tests done at any local laboratory. The results should be available in about three to five business days. The lab will be looking for things like anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid abnormalities, and vitamin deficiencies. It’s unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but it's important to identify the cause of your symptoms so we can address them appropriately. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact me. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… please don’t tell me it’s something serious. I have work to do. And my wife… she’d be devastated. Just the blood work, alright? And then we’ll see. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll go now. I’ll… I’ll see you next week, then. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR:
