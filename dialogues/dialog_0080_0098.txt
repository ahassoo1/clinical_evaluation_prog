DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey, good to meet you, Dr. Rosanova. Just… wanted to check things out, you know? Never really been to a doctor before, just curious, I guess. Been workin' on the boats a long time, figured I should probably see if everything's okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s smart to be proactive about your health. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. “Checking things out” is a good start. To give me a better idea of what to focus on, could you tell me a little more about what specifically prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really anything specific. Just… feelin’ kinda tired lately, I guess. And maybe a little achy after work, but that’s kinda normal, right? Workin’ with engines all day. It's just… feelin’ old before my time, maybe? Don't even know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Demondre. Feeling tired and achy, especially with a physically demanding job, is a perfectly valid reason to get things checked out. We’ll figure out what’s going on. So, this tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I wake up feelin' alright, and others… I just wanna sleep all day. It's not like, fallin' asleep everywhere, just… no energy. And it's been happenin' more lately, I think. Hard to say for sure, been busy with the boats.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned aches and pains after work – where are you feeling those mostly?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back, I guess. Lower back. And sometimes in my shoulders, from liftin' stuff. It usually goes away after a bit, but it's been stickin' around longer some days. Not real bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like an old man, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: You're not an old man, Demondre! It's good you’re noticing these changes. Let's talk a little more about your work. What kind of work do you do on the boats specifically?
PATIENT: I'm a sailor and a marine oiler. Mostly keep the engines runnin' smooth. Checkin' the oil, fixin' little things, that kinda stuff. It's a lot of bendin' and liftin', gettin' into tight spaces. Sometimes long days, you know? And it can get pretty hot down there with all the machinery. Sometimes cold too, dependin' on where we are.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Lots of physical work, varying temperatures, tight spaces. Have you had any injuries while working on the boats – anything that might have caused back pain or shoulder issues in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothin' major. I pulled a muscle in my back a couple years ago, liftin' a heavy part. Got it looked at, got some therapy, felt better after a bit. But it's kinda always been a little sore since then. And I twisted my shoulder once, tryin' to get into a tight space, but that healed up okay, I think. Nothin' I really needed a doctor for after that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. So, a history of a back muscle pull and a shoulder twist. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never been told I had anythin'. I usually feel pretty good, besides the tiredness and the aches, like I said. My mom had high blood pressure, I think, but I don't really remember. I don't go to the doctor much, so...
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a fan of takin' pills if I can help it. Just try to eat okay, get enough sleep when I can. Sometimes I take a pain reliever if my back's really botherin' me, but that's about it. Just the over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat pretty much anything, honestly. My mom always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. My dad… he was pretty healthy, I think. Worked construction his whole life. Passed away a few years back, kinda old age. My mom, like I said, had high blood pressure. And my grandma on my dad’s side had arthritis, I think. Lots of achy joints. That’s pretty much all I know, honestly. My family don’t really talk about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little something to work with. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I don't smoke. I'll have a beer sometimes with friends, maybe on the weekend, but not much. And definitely no drugs. Never been into any of that. Just not my thing. I like to stay busy with work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Alright, Demondre, that gives me a really good start. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me if it's gonna be uncomfortable or somethin'. I ain't used to this doctor stuff, so...
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing sounds normal on both sides. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Finally, let's check your range of motion in your back and shoulders. Okay, some tightness in your lower back and limited range of motion in your right shoulder, but nothing acutely painful. Do you feel any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yeah, kinda. My lower back gets a little stiff when I bend over, like you said. And my right shoulder feels a little… pinched when I reach behind my back. Not real bad, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. I'm feeling some tenderness in your lower back muscles, and a little tightness in your right shoulder. No obvious signs of muscle spasm. Alright, Demondre, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some muscle strain in your lower back, likely from your work, and some possible mild impingement in your right shoulder. It's not anything terribly serious, but we should get some imaging done just to rule out any other underlying issues. I'm going to order an X-ray of your lower back and right shoulder. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. X-rays sound fine. Better to be safe, I guess. When can I get those done? And will they tell me what's goin' on for sure?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll have the radiology department schedule those for you. They should be able to get you in tomorrow morning. As for what they'll tell us, X-rays can show us if there are any fractures, arthritis, or other bone abnormalities. They won't show soft tissue issues like muscle strains or ligament damage, but they're a good first step. If the X-rays don't reveal anything, we might consider an MRI to get a more detailed look at your muscles and ligaments. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. So, X-rays first, then maybe an MRI if they don't see anythin'. Okay. What about in the meantime? Should I be takin' anythin' for the pain? Or tryin' to do anythin' different at work?
DOCTOR: Okay, good question. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for the pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. Also, try to avoid any heavy lifting or bending at work as much as possible. If you have to lift something, make sure to use proper lifting technique – bend your knees, keep your back straight, and keep the object close to your body. Also, gentle stretching and heat application can help relieve muscle tension. Are you able to modify your work duties at all to reduce strain on your back and shoulder?
PATIENT: I think so. I can ask my boss if I can take it a little easier for a bit. Maybe focus on some of the lighter stuff, checkin' the oil and stuff. He's usually pretty understanding. I'll try to remember to bend my knees and keep my back straight when I gotta lift somethin'. It's easy to forget when you're in the middle of it.
DOCTOR: That's great, Demondre. Communication with your boss is a good first step. And don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I'm going to write you a note for work outlining these recommendations. I’ll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just in case the pain gets particularly bad. Take it only as needed and be careful when operating machinery while taking it. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A note for work is a good idea. And I'll be careful with the muscle relaxant. Don't wanna be fallin' off a boat or somethin'. So, when will I get the results from the X-rays? And what happens if they do find somethin' wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, the radiology department will send the results to me within 24-48 hours. I’ll review them as soon as I receive them and give you a call to discuss the findings. If the X-rays do reveal something wrong, we'll discuss the appropriate treatment options. Depending on the findings, that might include physical therapy, pain medication, or, in rare cases, further imaging or referral to a specialist. I'll explain everything thoroughly and answer any questions you have. For now, let’s focus on getting those X-rays done and taking it easy on your back and shoulder. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything. You explained it all pretty good. Thanks for takin' the time to listen to me, Dr. Rosanova. I appreciate it. I guess I'll see you after the X-rays then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Yes, I’ll be in touch as soon as I receive the results. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens before then. Here's that note for work, and the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Take care, and have a good day.
