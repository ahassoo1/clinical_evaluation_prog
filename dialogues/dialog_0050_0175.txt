DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: A little while… could you be more specific, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe about a month or so? It started kinda gradual, just a little ache, but it’s gotten worse over the last week or two. It’s… hard to say exactly, you know? Time just kinda slips away when you get older.
DOCTOR: Indeed. A month… and it’s progressively worsened. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It’s mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it feels like it radiates down my leg a little. Not all the way down, just… the upper part of my leg. It’s worse when I try to bend over, or if I’ve been standing for a long time.
DOCTOR: Radiating pain… and exacerbated by bending and prolonged standing. Do you recall any specific event that may have triggered this, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not really, no. Nothing I can think of. I haven’t fallen or lifted anything particularly heavy. Just… started happening, you know? I do a lot of gardening, but nothing different than usual. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Gardening… repetitive movements can certainly contribute to musculoskeletal discomfort. And the lack of a specific inciting event… that is not uncommon. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It’s not terrible, maybe a four or five. But like I said, if I move a certain way, it can shoot up to a seven or eight pretty quick. It comes and goes, really. It’s not constant.
DOCTOR: Four to seven, fluctuating… I see. Now, Mr. Way, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in either of your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything feels…normal, I guess. No tingling or anything like that. My feet might be a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from being on them too long. I don’t think that’s related.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's review your medical history. Do you have a list of your current medications with you, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No, I don't, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, when it gets really bad. Nothing prescribed, though. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always says I eat too much, but that’s a different story.
DOCTOR: That is… good to hear. Now, Mr. Way, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I had pneumonia once, maybe twenty years ago? But nothing major since then. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered.
DOCTOR: An appendectomy and a bout of pneumonia… quite reasonable. Now, concerning your family history, are there any instances of back problems, arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her hands, I think. And my brother, he had some trouble with his back when he was younger, lifting things at work. But that was a long time ago, and I’m not sure how serious it was. Nothing like what I’m experiencing, I don't think. My wife might know more. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That is… noted. Now, Mr. Way, before we proceed with a physical examination, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My wife wouldn't allow it. She’s very health-conscious. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Way, I'd like to perform a physical examination of your back and legs to assess the source of your pain. Please lie face down on the examination table for me. We will begin with palpation and range of motion testing. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Mr. Way, I am going to gently palpate your lower back to identify any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Please tell me if anything feels particularly painful. I’m noting some mild tenderness along the lumbar spine here, at L4-L5. Not acutely inflamed, but certainly a point of discomfort. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and to each side. Please stop if you experience any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh, that’s… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but I can feel it. And that’s… yeah, that’s worse. The right side feels tighter than the left. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Way. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly with extension, and there is noticeable discomfort with both flexion and extension. Palpation of the right paraspinal muscles reveals increased tone and tenderness. Now, Mr. Way, I’m going to lift each of your legs, keeping it straight, to assess for any nerve impingement. Please tell me if you experience any radiating pain down your leg during this maneuver. I’m noting no significant radiating pain with either straight leg raise, which is encouraging. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and I'm detecting no focal neurological deficits. Strength is 5/5 in both lower extremities. Based on this examination, Mr. Way, it appears you are experiencing a lumbar strain. The limited range of motion, paraspinal muscle tenderness, and discomfort with bending suggest inflammation and spasm of the lower back muscles. The absence of radiating pain or neurological deficits is reassuring.
PATIENT: Okay… a lumbar strain. That doesn't sound too bad. What does that mean, exactly? And what can we do about it? Is it something that will just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: A lumbar strain, Mr. Way, is a common injury involving the stretching or tearing of the muscles and ligaments in the lower back. It is typically caused by overuse, improper lifting technique, or sudden movements. In your case, the gardening is likely a contributing factor. It can resolve on its own with conservative management, yes, eventually. However, without proper care, it can become chronic and significantly impact your quality of life. Therefore, I recommend a multifaceted approach. Firstly, rest. Avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Secondly, ice packs applied to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Thirdly, over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce inflammation and discomfort. Furthermore, I will prescribe a mild muscle relaxant to alleviate the spasm. We will also schedule a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture, preventing future injuries. I’ll also provide you with a pamphlet detailing proper lifting techniques. Do you have any questions regarding this treatment plan, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… like a lot. Physical therapy… I wasn’t expecting that. And a muscle relaxant… I’m a little worried about side effects, you know? Will it make me sleepy? Can I still drive? I guess… I guess I just want to know if it’s really necessary. Could I just try the rest, ice and pain relievers first?
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, with all due respect, you presented with a condition that, while not immediately life-threatening, requires a comprehensive approach to ensure complete recovery and prevent recurrence. Simply “trying” rest, ice and over-the-counter medication may provide temporary relief, but it will not address the underlying muscular imbalances and poor biomechanics that are contributing to your pain. The muscle relaxant I am prescribing is a low-dose medication, and the side effects are typically mild. While some drowsiness is possible, it should not impair your ability to perform daily activities, including driving, provided you exercise caution. However, if you experience significant sedation, it is imperative that you refrain from operating heavy machinery or driving. The physical therapy is crucial. A qualified therapist will assess your posture, identify muscle weaknesses, and develop a customized exercise program to strengthen your core, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper body mechanics. It is an investment in your long-term health and well-being, Mr. Way. Are you prepared to follow the prescribed treatment plan, or would you prefer to explore alternative options?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You’re right. You're the doctor. I guess I’ll do it. The physical therapy… and the muscle relaxant. But… what if it doesn’t work? What if I'm still in pain after all that? And... how long will the physical therapy last? Will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. That's a bit of a worry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, it is highly improbable that the prescribed treatment plan will be ineffective, provided you adhere to it diligently. However, if your pain persists despite completing the course of physical therapy, we will explore further diagnostic testing, such as an MRI, to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. Regarding the duration of physical therapy, it typically lasts between six to eight weeks, with two to three sessions per week. The cost of each session varies depending on the therapist and location. As you have informed me of your lack of insurance, I can provide you with a list of facilities that offer sliding-scale fees or financial assistance programs. I will also write a letter to a few local clinics explaining your situation and requesting reduced rates. It is important to remember, Mr. Way, that investing in your health is a worthwhile endeavor. Allowing this condition to become chronic will only lead to greater discomfort, decreased functionality, and potentially more expensive treatment options in the future. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I guess I’ll go ahead and… schedule the physical therapy then. And I’ll pick up the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Hopefully this will all work. .
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Way. My nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork for scheduling your physical therapy appointment. She will also prepare a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 5mg, to be taken as directed. Follow the instructions carefully, and remember to exercise caution while driving or operating heavy machinery. I expect to see improvement within two weeks. Schedule a follow-up appointment with me then to assess your progress. Have a good day, Mr. Way. .
