DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. JULES. Please, have a seat. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's...it's my memory. It’s been getting worse, and it’s starting to worry me a bit. I forget things…little things, mostly, but also…bigger things sometimes. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Little things” and “bigger things” is rather vague, Ms. Heidenthal. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, you're right. Sorry. Let me think… Okay, well, yesterday I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for. Just stood there, staring at the produce section. And… last week, I had a doctor's appointment – not this one, another one – and I just…didn't go. Completely slipped my mind. It’s not like me at all. I used to be so organized.
DOCTOR: An isolated incident at the grocery store, and a single missed appointment… These things happen, Ms. Heidenthal. Stress, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I mean, life's been…normal. Not particularly stressful. And it's not just those two things. It’s been building up for a few months now. Like, I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and can’t quite recall their name, even if I just met them. It's…frustrating, to say the least. Do you…do you understand what I mean? It's not like I'm losing days, but it's enough to make me anxious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, anxiety can cause memory lapses, you know. It's a vicious cycle. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Not really… I don’t think so. I’m sleeping okay, I guess. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but that could just be the summer heat. And… no headaches or anything like that. Honestly, it’s mostly just the forgetting. It doesn’t feel like anything else is wrong, just… foggy sometimes. Is that helpful? I'm trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Foggy. Right. Let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Um… let me see. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course. And… I broke my wrist when I was in university, skiing. Nothing major. Oh! And I had really bad migraines in my twenties, but those went away years ago. The doctor said it was probably stress-related then, too. Is that what you need to know? I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything serious. I'm generally very healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: Past surgical history?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them. Just the broken wrist, and that didn’t require surgery, just a cast. It healed fine. I’m… I’m starting to feel a little silly listing all these things, honestly. Is this not the kind of memory loss you’re worried about? Like, forgetting how to drive or something? Because I haven't experienced that.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Heidenthal, that is not what I am asking. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history… Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had some memory problems when she got older, but we just thought it was… old age, you know? She didn’t get a formal diagnosis or anything. She just… repeated herself a lot and got confused sometimes. My father was fine, as far as I know. And… I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away when I was very young. Does that help? It’s not very detailed, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And… no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I don’t even really get colds that often, thankfully. I try to eat healthy and stay active, so I don't usually need much medication. I just worry this is something…serious. Do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, with all due respect, you are presenting with rather vague symptoms. I’m not going to jump to conclusions based on a few instances of forgetfulness. However, we will proceed with a basic neurological examination to rule out anything obvious. It's simply good practice. Please follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Yes, good practice. I’m glad you’re taking it seriously. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? What should I expect during this examination? Will it be…uncomfortable? I’m not very good with…medical things, to be honest. I get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: It will be a simple assessment of reflexes, balance, and coordination, Ms. Heidenthal. Nothing to be alarmed about. Please sit up straight and follow my directions as closely as possible. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Today’s date… let me think. It’s… August… the second? Yes, August 2nd. 2025, right? I think so. Is that correct? Sometimes the days just…blend together. I hope I got that right.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I want you to repeat after me. “The sky is blue.”
PATIENT: “The sky is blue.” Is that alright? It feels… strange, being tested like this. I hope I’m not doing anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me the name of this clinic?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… This is… Dr. Jules’ clinic? I…I think that’s right. Is that… is that what it’s called? I feel silly not knowing simple things like this. It’s right here on the paperwork, isn’t it? I’m just…drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, based on this brief assessment, your cognitive function appears… largely intact. However, your anxiety is clearly contributing to your difficulties. I recommend a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies or thyroid issues. And frankly, I believe a consultation with a psychiatrist might be beneficial to address your escalating concerns.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. So… it’s just anxiety? But…what if it is something more? The forgetting feels…real. I appreciate you checking, Doctor, but I’m not sure I want to see a psychiatrist. It feels… drastic. Couldn’t it just be stress? Maybe I need a vacation?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, I am a physician. I assure you, I am qualified to assess your condition. While stress can exacerbate memory issues, your concerns warrant further investigation. Ignoring them will not make them disappear. I am writing a referral for a full blood panel and a psychiatric evaluation. Consider this my professional recommendation. It is ultimately your decision, of course. However, I strongly advise you to follow through with these consultations. Now, if there is nothing further, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. If you think it’s best… I’ll do it. I just… I don't like the idea of being told it's all in my head. But…you’re the doctor. No, nothing further, I think. Thank you, Doctor Jules.
