DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, hello. I need to get a card… for driving, you know? A commercial driver one. For ride-sharing. It’s… a bit complicated, getting older and needing to keep up with all the paperwork. But I’m here now, so let’s get it done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Right, a commercial driver’s license medical card for ride-sharing. I understand. It can be a bit of a process, especially with changes over time. No worries, we'll get through it together. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, general health… well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. I have a little bit of trouble with my knees, and my back aches sometimes. Nothing too serious, I don't take any strong medicines for it. Just some cream, you know? And I get tired easier than I used to. I walk most days though, keeps me going. Is that the kind of thing you need to know? I really don’t go to the doctor much otherwise.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful, San. Knowing about the knees, back, and fatigue is important. And it's good you're still able to walk – that's excellent. Just to be thorough, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, maybe ten years back. I take a little pill for it, a small white one. I think it's… amlodipine? Something like that. Other than that… no, nothing major. I had a bad flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered just fine. Everything else is just… old age, I suppose. I really don’t remember much beyond the blood pressure, to be honest. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. We can look things up as well. Amlodipine for high blood pressure – good to know. And it’s helpful you had the flu a couple of years ago. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements – even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the amlodipine, Doctor. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. The regular kind, you buy at the store. Nothing else. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I forgot about it this year. Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering those things. It’s good to keep me reminded, though. It’s probably best if I just stick to the amlodipine, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, San. So, just amlodipine regularly and ibuprofen as needed. Good plan to focus on those. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish, but not me. I’ve always been lucky that way. No, no allergies at all. It’s one less thing to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, San. No known allergies is excellent. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My mother… she had heart trouble when she got older. She had a pacemaker put in, I think. And my father, he had diabetes. He wasn't very careful with his diet, unfortunately. My older brother… he had some kind of cancer, lung cancer, I believe. But he smoked his whole life. It wasn't a surprise, really. Other than that… not much that I can think of. It’s a bit hazy, you know, remembering back so far. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, San. Heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and lung cancer in your brother – that gives me a good starting point. It's good you remember that much, and it's alright if it's a little hazy. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, exactly? Do you mean… about my husband? Because he passed away a few years ago. I live alone now. I keep busy, though. I like to garden, and I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. I don’t really… go out much, except for groceries and things like that. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. Is that what you’re looking for? It feels a bit personal, asking about all this.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, San. It can feel a bit personal, and I apologize if it does. By social history, I'm trying to get a picture of your lifestyle and habits, things that might affect your health. You've already given me a lot of important information. Knowing you live alone, keep busy with gardening and volunteering, and don’t drink or smoke is very helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out many years ago. That was… oh, maybe 30 years back? And I broke my wrist when I was younger, fell off a bicycle. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’ve never been seriously ill, you know? I’ve always been a strong person, even if I’m getting a bit creaky now. Is that enough? I’d really like to get this card sorted, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent information, San. Gallbladder removal 30 years ago and a broken wrist – good to know. And it sounds like you have been very healthy overall. Alright. To proceed with the medical exam required for the commercial driver's license, I’m going to need to check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I’m ready when you are, Doctor. I’m not fond of doctors, if I’m honest, but I understand it needs to be done. Just try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a volunteer shift later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, San. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated. Your pulse is 76, which is good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lower lungs on both sides. That could be due to a number of things. Now, let's check your vision. Your vision is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left, with some difficulty reading the smaller letters. Do you experience any shortness of breath or coughing, San?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. Sometimes, if I walk up a steep hill, I get a little winded, but that’s just because I’m old. And I cough a bit in the mornings, just a little tickle in my throat. Nothing serious, I’ve had it for years. It’s worse in the winter, I think. Is that what you’re asking about? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a sickly person. I just want to be able to keep driving and helping out at the library. Is that crackling going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. The crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things, including some mild fluid buildup, which is common with age, or a previous respiratory infection. Given your history of a morning cough, we need to investigate this further to ensure it isn't something more significant. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It's a quick and painless procedure that will allow us to see what's going on in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… oh dear. I don't like hospitals, Doctor. And I really don't like radiation. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if it's just a little crackling, and I've felt fine for years… Couldn't we just… try the card first? I need to drive people, you know? And I have commitments. I really don’t want to have to go to a hospital if I don't have to. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't important. The commercial driver’s license requirements are quite strict for a reason – they want to ensure drivers are physically able to operate a vehicle safely. Given the crackling in your lungs and your history of a morning cough, an X-ray is the best way to rule out any underlying issues like pneumonia or early signs of heart failure that could affect your ability to drive safely. If we proceed with the card without investigating this further, and something were to happen, there could be serious consequences. And, unfortunately, I can't ethically sign off on the medical form without having a clear picture of your respiratory health. However, I completely understand your reluctance. I can refer you to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, who may have alternative methods for assessing your lung health. Would that be something you’d be comfortable with?
PATIENT: A lung specialist… that sounds… less scary than a whole hospital. Yes, a specialist would be better. If they can do some tests without all the radiation, that would be wonderful. Can you recommend someone nearby? And how long would it take to get an appointment? I really need to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I promised Mrs. Henderson a ride to her doctor next week, and I don’t want to let her down. I just… I don’t want to be a burden, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, San. You’re not a burden at all. It’s good you prioritize helping others. I can recommend Dr. Emily Carter, a pulmonologist at the Rural Health Clinic about 20 minutes from here. She’s very thorough and has a good reputation. I’ll have my assistant schedule an appointment for you right away. Typically, they can get new patients in within a week or two. I’ll also have them send me the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, fever, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'll also prepare a note for you to take to Dr. Carter outlining my findings today. While we’re waiting for the appointment, I can’t ethically sign off on the commercial driver's license medical form. But, once we have Dr. Carter’s assessment, we can revisit the situation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Dr. Carter, that’s good. A week or two… I suppose I can manage. And I’ll keep an eye out for any trouble breathing or pain. I always do. A note to Dr. Carter… perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, even if I am being difficult. It’s just… getting older is a bother, you know? Everything takes so much longer. So, for now, no card? Just the appointment? Alright. Let’s get that scheduled, then. I have to go home and feed my cat. He gets very cross if I’m late.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. It's perfectly understandable to feel that way. Getting older is a bother sometimes, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. And yes, for now, we'll focus on getting you an appointment with Dr. Carter. My assistant, Sarah, will contact you to schedule that. Once we have her assessment, we can revisit the medical form. Sarah, could you please schedule an appointment for San with Dr. Carter and let her know about the commercial driver's license medical form?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to… Sarah, was it? I appreciate your help. I think that’s all for now, then? I’ll go home and wait for the phone call. If I don’t hear anything in a few days, I’ll give you a call. I really need to get going. My cat is probably plotting my demise as we speak.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And do give your cat a little extra attention from me! It was a pleasure meeting you, San. I wish you all the best. And I hope you have a lovely afternoon. .
