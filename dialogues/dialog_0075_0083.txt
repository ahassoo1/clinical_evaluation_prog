DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Panjoj, you say? Yes, well, it’s… it’s a bit of a silly thing, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. My… people… they don’t think much of me these days. A card from the doctor might… help things. It’s just… morale, you understand?
DOCTOR: I see. While I typically focus on physical health concerns, I understand that emotional well-being is incredibly important, and can absolutely impact your overall health. It’s not silly at all to want support, Mr. Kammer. Before I write anything, though, would you mind telling me a little more about why your “people” don’t think much of you?
PATIENT: Well… it’s my… situation. You see, I’m retired. Was a boiler operator for… a long time. Good job, important job. But now… now I’m just… around. My daughter, she thinks I should be… busier. Doing something. And her husband… he doesn’t hide how he feels. Says I’m a burden. It's… complicated. I just… a little encouragement would be nice, you understand? From a professional. Not… them.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation, and feeling undervalued can be incredibly disheartening. It's very common for people to struggle with adjusting to retirement, and feeling like they’ve lost purpose. And it's perfectly reasonable to want validation from someone outside of your immediate family. To get a better sense of how this is affecting you, could you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Well… tired. Mostly tired. Not just… sleepy tired. Just… empty tired. I don’t… I don’t enjoy things anymore. Used to like fishing. Now… what’s the point? And… I get irritated. Easily. Small things bother me. My daughter says I’m being difficult. Maybe she’s right. It’s just… hard to explain. It feels like… like everyone is looking at me like I'm a waste of space.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re experiencing some symptoms of what could be depression, Mr. Kammer. Feeling tired, losing interest in things you once enjoyed, and increased irritability are all common signs. It's important to rule out any underlying physical causes, so I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health, if that’s alright. First, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Depression? Now, hold on. I’m not… depressed. Just… frustrated. But… well, my appetite… hasn’t been good, no. I eat… when my daughter makes something. But I don’t really want to. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not much. But my pants… they feel a bit looser. Is that what you’re asking? It’s just… hard to care about things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not about labeling you, Mr. Kammer, but about understanding what's going on so we can figure out how to help you feel better. Changes in appetite and weight are often associated with mood changes, and it’s good you've noticed those. Have you been having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Trouble sleeping… yes. Sort of. I don't… I don't sleep well. I wake up a lot. Thinking about… things. Mostly about… what a failure I am. And then I can't get back to sleep. My daughter says I snore. Loudly. But I don't… I don't feel rested when I wake up. Just… tired. More tired. It’s a vicious cycle, you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds incredibly draining. I’m going to ask you a few questions from a brief questionnaire, just to get a better understanding of how you’ve been feeling overall. It's completely confidential, and will help me determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? You think I need… tests? Look, Doctor, I just want a card. A little note. Is that too much to ask? I don’t need… poking and prodding. I just want a little encouragement. From you. That’s all. But… if it’s the only way to get the card… I suppose. But I’m not promising I’ll like it.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you really just want some validation, and a little encouragement. And I absolutely can write you a note, and I will. But as a doctor, I also want to make sure there isn’t something else going on that’s contributing to how you feel. Sometimes, even just identifying a problem can make a huge difference. This questionnaire will simply help me rule out anything else that might be causing your symptoms. And if everything checks out, I’m happy to write you that note. How does that sound?
PATIENT: …Fine. Fine, Doctor. Ask your questions. But I’m telling you, it’s just… morale. That’s all. Just a little… low morale. But… alright. Ask away. Get it over with. And then… the card?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. And yes, we’ll absolutely get to the card. Okay, first question: Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: …Often. Very often. I haven’t enjoyed anything in… well, a long time. What kind of question is this? It’s obvious, isn’t it? I told you, Doctor. Low morale. Now, can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, next question: How often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: …Sometimes. Not every day. But… when I think about things… about my situation… yes. Sometimes. It feels like… like there’s no point. No point in anything. But I don’t want to talk about it. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about this one: How often have you been bothered by trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: I already told you! Trouble sleeping. Waking up. Thinking. It’s a constant thing. Every night. Are you even listening to me, Doctor? This is getting… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if I seem to be repeating myself. I need to ask these questions to get a complete picture. Next question: How often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy?
PATIENT: Constantly. Constantly. I’m always tired. Even when I sleep… I wake up tired. It’s exhausting just… existing. This is a waste of time, Doctor. Just write the card and be done with it. I can feel my blood pressure rising just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. I truly do. However, based on your answers so far, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to address this, even if it’s just to rule it out. I want to be clear: I will write you a note. But I also want to offer you some support and resources to help you feel better. Would you be willing to let me explain some potential options, such as talking to a therapist or trying medication?
PATIENT: Medication?! Are you serious? I am not taking any pills! And a therapist? Talking about my feelings to a stranger? Absolutely not. I just want a card, Doctor. A simple “Get Well” card. Is that too much to ask? You're a doctor, not a… a head shrinker. I came here for a note, and that's what I expect. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm wasting my entire morning on this nonsense.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kammer. You're entitled to your feelings, and I respect your decision. I will absolutely write you a note. I want you to feel comfortable, and I won’t push you to do anything you don’t want to do. However, I would like to at least discuss some other options for addressing your symptoms, such as support groups or lifestyle changes. But we can set those aside for now if you prefer. Just to clarify, before I write the note, are there any specific things you'd like me to include in it?
PATIENT: Just… just something encouraging. Something that says… that says someone recognizes I’m still here. That I haven't completely disappeared. Something about… about not giving up. And… and maybe something about… about being appreciated. But don’t make it too… flowery. I’m not one for sentimental nonsense. Just… something simple. And get it over with.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Kammer. How does this sound?
PATIENT: ... Let me see... ... It's... alright. Not bad. A little... less sentimental than I expected, which is good. "Recognizing your strength and resilience," huh? That's... acceptable. ... Yes. That will do. Thank you, Doctor. Now, can I have a copy?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. Here you are. I truly hope it brings you some comfort. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything, even if it's just to talk. I’ve also included some information on local support groups, just in case you change your mind. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: ...No. No, thank you. That will be all. I appreciate your time, Doctor. ...Goodbye. ...And thank you... for the note.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: .
