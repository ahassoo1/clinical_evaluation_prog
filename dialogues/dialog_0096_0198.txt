DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Burlingham. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and honestly, I’m just curious if it might be something that could help me. I work… well, it’s a stressful job, fixing signals and track switches, you know? Lots of responsibility. It’s not a bad job, just… a lot. I was hoping you might have some information, or know where I could learn more?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It seems like a lot of people are finding it helpful for… well, for everything, really. I keep seeing articles, and my neighbor, she does a class, and she seems a lot calmer these days. I don’t even really know what it is, exactly, just that it involves… focusing, and breathing? I guess? And I thought maybe, as my doctor, you might know if it’s something that could be good for someone like me. And, you know, if it has any downsides? I don’t want to start something and then find out it’s not a good fit.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sugino, it’s… good that you’re proactive about your wellbeing. Though, honestly, coming to a doctor for information on meditation... It’s not typically what we train for. It’s more… a lifestyle choice, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to… put you on the spot. It just… I trust you, and you know my medical history, and I thought maybe you'd have some resources, or know if it would interfere with anything. I didn’t realize it was outside your usual scope of practice. That was silly of me. I can certainly look elsewhere, of course. Don’t worry about me, I’ll find information some other way.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, dear, no harm done. It’s just… people come in with all sorts of questions. But you're right, I’m a medical doctor, not a… wellness guru. Now, while we’re here, are you experiencing any actual medical concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Sorry, I got sidetracked. No, nothing like that, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? I had my yearly check-up in February and everything was good then. That’s why I thought… if I wasn’t ill, maybe I could explore something preventative, like mindfulness, to stay that way. Does that make sense? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Your records do show a normal check-up in February. Height 161 centimeters, weight 136 pounds… a bit on the heavier side, but within range. Alright. Well, since you’re generally healthy, and this is more of a… holistic enquiry, I suppose I can offer a little advice. But I'm not going to spend a significant amount of time on this. Are you experiencing any stress-related physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Thank you. That’s very kind of you. Physical symptoms… well, sometimes my shoulders are very tense, and I get headaches a lot. Not terrible, but… persistent. And I clench my jaw when I’m really concentrating, which my husband used to tease me about, but he’s passed now. I also sleep… not badly, exactly, but I wake up a lot during the night. I think it’s just from… thinking. Lots and lots of thinking. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tense shoulders, headaches, jaw clenching, disrupted sleep… Yes, those can be stress-related. And losing your husband… that's a significant life event, regardless of how long ago it was. Now, before we attribute everything to stress, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. He passed about three years ago. It still feels… recent, sometimes. My vision… hmm. No, not really. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said everything was stable, just needing reading glasses for close-up work. I do get… a little bit of blurriness sometimes, especially when I’m tired, but I just assumed that was from strain. I do a lot of paperwork at work, you see, and then I read at night. It’s probably just that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any dizziness, or changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No, none at all, Doctor. No dizziness, and my hearing is perfectly fine, as far as I know. My neighbor always complains about hers, but I haven’t had any trouble. I can hear everything perfectly, even the little birds chirping outside. I think I’m just… a worrier, naturally. Perhaps that’s contributing to the tension and the headaches. That's why I thought mindfulness might help. To calm my mind a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. Given your relatively normal check-up and the lack of any significant neurological symptoms, it’s possible that your symptoms are related to stress and anxiety. However, headaches and jaw clenching can have other causes. I suggest we rule out temporomandibular joint disorder, or TMJ. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a dentist specializing in TMJ. It would be best to get that assessed. Do you have any allergies or medications I need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Dr. Ramirez, you say? I’ll certainly look him up. Allergies… no, none that I’m aware of. And medications… just the usual over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, when they get bad. Ibuprofen, occasionally. Nothing prescribed, though. I haven't taken anything regularly in years. And, um, sometimes chamomile tea. Does that count? I suppose that’s not a medication. I drink it for the calming effect.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is… fine. Alright. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez. He’s a good dentist, and will be able to determine if your jaw clenching is related to TMJ. If it's not TMJ, then we can discuss potential stress management techniques. Mindfulness is… an option, but it's not a substitute for proper medical evaluation. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s wonderful. Thank you so much for the referral. And for taking the time to listen to me, even about the chamomile tea. I think I was just… hoping for some reassurance, really. And you’ve given me a good starting point. I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez right away. I suppose, for now, I'll focus on that. Thank you again. I appreciate your time, and your patience. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get that checked out, and then we'll see. Have a good day, Ms. Sugino. .
