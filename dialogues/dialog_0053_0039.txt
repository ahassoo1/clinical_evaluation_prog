DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Doyle Pitmon, I’m one of the internal medicine physicians here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Pitmon. Well, the nurse gave me some papers… said my cholesterol was a bit high. Hyper… something-lipidemia, she called it. Doesn't sound good, does it? I mostly just feel…old, you know? But I guess that ain't a medical problem.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. It's… not ideal, certainly. And feeling “old” can absolutely have medical components, Mr. Bohnett. We don’t dismiss anything. But let’s focus on this cholesterol for now. The nurse gave you the results, good. Do you happen to recall what your numbers were?
PATIENT: Numbers… hmm. She did say some numbers, didn’t she? I’m good with dates, birthdays, things like that, but these medical figures… slipped right past me. Something about a good number and a bad number, I think? And a number in the middle? Honestly, Doctor, it was all a bit of a blur. I mostly just nodded and thanked her for not yelling at me. Is it really that bad?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not worry about remembering, that's what I’m here for. According to these results from July 15th... your total cholesterol is 265, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 180, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 35, and your triglycerides are 150. Those numbers are elevated, Mr. Bohnett. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does require attention. Now, have you ever been told about high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a word. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life, mostly outdoors. Supervisor for… well, I looked after folks who needed help, you know? Social work kind of stuff. Kept me busy, though. But high cholesterol… this is new. Is it something I did? Or is it just… old age catching up? Sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something you did, Mr. Bohnett. There’s a strong genetic component to cholesterol levels. Diet and exercise play a role, certainly, but sometimes it’s simply a matter of predisposition. And, yes, as we age, our cholesterol tends to rise. Now, tell me about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, you see. My wife, bless her, passed away five years ago. So, I mostly fix what’s easy. Breakfast is usually toast with a little butter and jam, maybe an egg if I’m feeling ambitious. Lunch is a sandwich, ham and cheese mostly. And dinner… well, that varies. Sometimes I’ll heat up a frozen meal, sometimes I’ll grill a steak if the weather’s nice. I do enjoy a good steak. And I have a sweet tooth, I confess. A cookie with my coffee most evenings. Not much fruit, I’m ashamed to say. And I do like my bacon with breakfast. I try not to overdo it, but… there you go.
DOCTOR: Alright. That gives me a better picture. The bacon, the steak, the cookies... these all contribute. Now, do you drink alcohol, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Just a little, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Red wine, mostly. My wife and I always enjoyed a good glass of red with our meals. Old habit, I suppose. Not every night, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week. And not a big glass, just a normal size. Nothing to write home about, really. I don’t go out drinking with the boys or anything like that. Mostly just at home, with my dinner.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, that’s where I fall down, I reckon. Used to be, when I was working, I was always on my feet, going from place to place. But since I retired… not so much. I take a little walk around the block sometimes, when the weather’s good. But it’s not a regular thing. I mostly enjoy sitting on the porch, watching the world go by. Old bones, you know? They don’t move like they used to. I used to enjoy gardening, but bending over is getting harder and harder. So, mostly… I sit. I know I should do more, Doctor. I really do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, with all due respect, your lifestyle isn’t helping matters. The diet, the alcohol, the lack of exercise… these are all contributing to your elevated cholesterol. Now, we need to address this. Before we talk about medication – and we may need to consider that – I want to discuss some changes you can make. However, given your age, and the fact you haven’t been regularly active, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding if it helps. I’m not afraid of a little examination. Just… be gentle with the old bones, alright? I haven’t had a proper check-up in years, so I suppose it’s overdue. And yes, I understand about making changes. It won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. I don't want to end up flat on my back, you know? What kind of changes are you thinking? Less bacon, I imagine?
DOCTOR: Less bacon, yes. And a reduction in red wine. We need to focus on lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And we absolutely need to incorporate some regular physical activity. We’ll start slowly, of course. Perhaps a short walk every day, gradually increasing the distance and intensity. But first, let’s get this exam done. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Lead the way. Old bones are a bit creaky getting up, but I’ll manage. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. And try not to laugh if I groan a bit. It's a sign of character, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Deep breaths, if you would. In and out… good. Heart sounds are… slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… good. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A bit elevated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, but your blood pressure is a bit high, and we need to address your cholesterol. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with medications before. I take a little something for my arthritis now and then, but that's all. Just a small dose when it flares up. And I don’t react to penicillin or anything like that. My wife always checked, she was very careful about those things. Bless her again. So, no allergies to report. What kind of medication are you thinking? Something I have to take every day? That sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s likely we will need to consider a statin, Mr. Bohnett. These medications are very effective at lowering cholesterol. They are typically taken once daily. Now, they do have potential side effects, such as muscle aches, but these are usually mild and manageable. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. Before we proceed, I want to be absolutely certain there are no contraindications. Do you have any kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: Kidney or liver… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. My wife always handled the medical stuff, she kept all the records. I’ve never been told I have any problems with those organs. I’ve always felt… normal, you know? A bit achy in the mornings, but that’s just old age, I reckon. I don't drink much alcohol, so I don’t think that would be a problem. She always said everything was fine when I went for my check-ups. But it’s been… a long time. Is there a way to check? I don't want to take anything that’s going to mess things up even more.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Mr. Bohnett. Given the lack of recent medical records, we’ll need to run some blood tests. Specifically, a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to recheck your cholesterol levels. We'll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes affect cholesterol. Before we order those tests, do you currently take any supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Supplements… let me think. Old Mrs. Henderson down the street recommended a glucosamine supplement for my arthritis. Said it helped her joints. I’ve been taking it on and off for a few months now. Just a small dose, when my knees are acting up. Nothing else, really. Just that glucosamine, and the little arthritis pill when I need it. And the occasional vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on. But that’s it. Nothing fancy. Do you think that glucosamine could be affecting things? I didn’t realize it could do that.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine can sometimes interact with certain medications, and it’s best to disclose everything you’re taking. It’s unlikely to be a major factor, but we need a complete picture. Alright, Mr. Bohnett. I’m going to order those blood tests. The nurse will draw them shortly. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, please try to reduce your intake of saturated fats and cholesterol, increase your physical activity, and discontinue the glucosamine supplement. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Less bacon, more walking, stop the glucosamine. And wait for the blood tests. That sounds… manageable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to know what’s going on. And thank you for not yelling at me about the bacon. I’ll see you next week, then. Let’s hope those tests aren’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. The nurse will be in shortly. Please let me know if you experience any new or concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. We'll discuss the results next week. That will be all for today.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. I’ll see you next week.
