DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I look into something... about preventing HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take, even if you’re not… you know… actively worried, but just want to be safe. That’s what I’m here about, I think. PrEP, she called it. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right – PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's a very good question to ask about, and it’s smart of you to be proactive about your health. To make sure it's a good fit for you, let's talk a little bit more about your risk factors and your overall health. First, can you tell me a little about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s been a while since I’ve been with anyone regularly. I’m single, as you can see on the paperwork, and haven’t had a… a partner in several years. I wouldn’t say no activity at all, but it’s… infrequent, and usually with people I meet casually. I’m not one for commitment, if you know what I mean. Does that make sense? It’s… not a steady thing.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for being open with me. So, infrequent sexual contact with casual partners. That helps me understand things a little better. Have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections – STIs – before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, when I was… younger, I went through a phase where I was seeing a lot of different people. I made sure to get tested regularly then. I haven’t been tested in… oh, maybe five years? Six? It was definitely before the pandemic, I remember that much. Everything came back clear then, but I suppose things change.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know you’ve been tested before. Six years ago is a bit of a gap, so we’ll definitely want to update that. Besides sexual activity, are there any other factors that make you concerned about HIV?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It’s just… with everything going on in the world, and my friend being so insistent, it got me thinking. It’s not like I think I’m at risk, but… wouldn’t it be better to be safe? I'm a practical woman. And truthfully, I don't want to be another statistic. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to think about this, and wanting to be proactive is excellent. Okay, so no specific concerns, just wanting to be safe and informed. Let’s quickly go over some of your medical history to make sure PrEP is a good option for you. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself. I walk a lot. Helps keep me sane, living in the city.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and an appendectomy. Good to know. And just to confirm, you said you walk a lot – is there any pain or difficulty with that, or any other limitations with your physical activity?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. I walk everywhere. To the market, to the park, even to visit friends if they’re not too far. It’s my main exercise, really. Keeps me going. Honestly, if I stopped walking, I think I'd feel awful. I'm a bit of a restless person.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Helaina. Staying active is so important. Okay, so no limitations with activity. Now, just a quick family history question – do you know of anyone in your family who has ever had HIV or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My parents are both gone now, and I didn't know them very well. And I don’t have any siblings. I’ve got a few cousins, but I haven’t seen them in years. We’re not a very close family, truthfully. So, no, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, no known family history of serious medical conditions. Alright, Helaina, based on what you've told me so far, PrEP could be a good option for you. However, to be completely sure, we need to do some blood work to check your kidney function, make sure you don’t have HIV already, and check for other STIs. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. I wouldn’t want to take a pill without knowing for sure it’s safe, or if I even need it. Blood work is fine. Let's get it over with, if you don’t mind. The sooner I know, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, great. I'll have the nurse come in and draw some blood. It’s just a standard arm draw. While we’re waiting, I'll explain the PrEP medication itself a little more, how it works, potential side effects, and how often you'd need to take it. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. I appreciate you explaining everything. Honestly, I’m a little nervous about taking another pill, even if it’s just for prevention. I don't like feeling reliant on medication, but… better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Helaina. It’s good to be cautious. PrEP is generally very well-tolerated, and the side effects are usually mild. The medication we typically use is a combination of two drugs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. It works by preventing HIV from establishing itself in your body. You take it once a day, and it’s most effective when taken consistently. Common side effects can include mild nausea, diarrhea, or headache, but those usually go away after a few weeks. We’ll also monitor your kidney function regularly, as these medications can sometimes affect the kidneys, though that’s rare. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Once a day, I can handle that. And I'm glad you mentioned the kidney thing, that's always a worry. What happens if I… miss a dose? Or a few? I'm pretty good about routines, but you never know. Life happens, right? I wouldn't want to mess things up if I forget a couple of pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Helaina. It’s important to be realistic about adherence. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up to make up for missed doses. If you miss more than one dose, it's best to call the office so we can discuss whether you need to be retested before resuming PrEP. It's important to maintain consistent levels of the medication in your system for it to be effective. And it doesn't protect against other STIs, so safe sex practices are still important. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, so don't double up, call if I miss a lot, and still be careful. Got it. And what about… interactions with other medications? I take that Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as we discussed. Would that interfere with anything? I don't take anything else regularly, thankfully. I try to avoid pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Helaina. Lisinopril is generally considered safe to take with PrEP, but there's a small risk of increased creatinine levels in some people. We'll monitor your kidney function closely, as we discussed, to make sure everything stays within a normal range. It’s always a good idea to let all your doctors know about all the medications you’re taking, just to be safe. And if you ever start taking any new medications, even over-the-counter ones, let us know. Do you have any other questions before the nurse comes in for the blood work?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers most of it. You've been very thorough, thank you. I'm still a little apprehensive, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Let's just get the blood work done and see what the results say, I suppose. Hopefully, it’s all straightforward.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very sensible approach. The nurse will be in shortly. It’s just a routine draw, and it shouldn’t take long. Once we get the results back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and decide if PrEP is the right option for you. In the meantime, do you have any concerns about safe sex practices, or would you like any information on that?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I've… been around the block a few times, so to speak. I'm pretty careful, and I know what I'm doing. Just want to get this PrEP thing sorted, if it's the right choice. Hopefully, all clear. I'm ready when the nurse is.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just one last thing, Helaina. While we're waiting, do you have any questions for me about HIV prevention in general, or anything related to sexual health?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good. You've answered everything I've thought to ask, honestly. I'm ready to get this blood work done. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. The more I know, the better, and you’ve certainly done that.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. I'm glad I could help. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. It shouldn’t be long now. I’ll be back in to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Thank you for coming in today.
