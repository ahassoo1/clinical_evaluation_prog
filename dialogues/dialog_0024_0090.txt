DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’m here for a clearance, I believe? For surgery. Cosmetic surgery, specifically. Though… details are a little hazy. My husband… he arranged everything, you see. And it was some time ago now.
DOCTOR: A surgical clearance… arranged by your husband. I see. And you say it was some time ago?
PATIENT: Yes, quite some time. It feels… distant. Perhaps six months, maybe more? It’s hard to say exactly. He… passed away shortly after, and everything became rather… blurry. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. I mostly just want to ensure everything is alright before proceeding, you understand?
DOCTOR: Six months, after the passing of your husband…Right. Well, Ms. Brightful, it's vital we ascertain precisely what surgery is scheduled, the surgeon involved, and why a clearance is needed at this juncture. Do you have any documentation—appointment details, a surgeon's name, anything at all—or will I need to contact someone to obtain that information?
PATIENT: I… I really wish I did, Doctor. I’ve looked, truly I have. There were papers, I think, but they seem to have been… handled after. I don't recall who handled them, precisely. Perhaps his lawyer? I honestly wouldn’t know. It’s… terribly frustrating. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Would contacting his lawyer be the best course of action, then?
DOCTOR: It would certainly be the most efficient, Ms. Brightful. We cannot proceed with a surgical clearance without knowing the details of the planned procedure. Do you recall which lawyer represented your husband?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… a difficult one. I believe his name was Mr… Alvarez? Or was it Gonzales? He had an office downtown, I vaguely recall. A rather large building. It was… recommended by a friend, I think. I'm so sorry. I should have kept better records, but everything happened so quickly.
DOCTOR: Alvarez or Gonzales… downtown. That narrows it…somewhat. Very well, Ms. Brightful. I will attempt to locate the appropriate legal representation and request the necessary documentation. In the interim, could you tell me anything about your current health status?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. As far as I’m aware, I’m… reasonably healthy. I work outdoors quite a bit, landscaping, so I get plenty of exercise. I haven't been to a doctor in… a while, truthfully. Since… well, since everything. I don’t have any major illnesses that I know of, and I take a daily multivitamin. I do occasionally get headaches, but nothing debilitating. Is that… helpful information?
DOCTOR: “Reasonably healthy” and “occasionally get headaches” are hardly sufficient for a surgical clearance, Ms. Brightful. I need specifics. Have you experienced any recent weight changes?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I… I have lost a little weight, I believe. Perhaps five or six pounds. It’s been gradual, over the past few months. I haven't been eating as well, and work is… demanding. But nothing drastic, Doctor. I assure you. I'm normally around 130 pounds, give or take a few. I weighed myself recently, and it was… closer to 124.
DOCTOR: Five to six pounds can be significant, Ms. Brightful, especially in conjunction with a scheduled surgical procedure. And your current weight of 124… is noticeably different from the 130 you state as your norm. Do you have any family history of blood clots, or any issues with wound healing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… hadn’t occurred to me. No, Doctor, as far as I am aware, there isn’t any family history of blood clots. My mother lived to a very old age, and she was always quite… robust. As for wound healing, I’ve always healed well. Scratches, cuts… nothing unusual. Though… my grandmother, on my father’s side, did have a difficult time recovering from a hip replacement. But that was many years ago. I hope that isn’t a bad sign?
DOCTOR: A difficult recovery in a first-degree relative is relevant, Ms. Brightful. It indicates a potential predisposition. Now, let's proceed to a physical examination. I will need to assess your vital signs and perform a brief examination to determine your suitability for surgery. Please disrobe from the waist up, and I will return shortly.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. Thank you for your patience. It’s… difficult to remember everything, you see. I do apologize again for the lack of information.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, if you’ll please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. 130 over 78. Acceptable, though slightly elevated. Heart rate is 82, regular. Now, I will listen to your lungs. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now, let’s palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No tenderness that I’m aware of. Perhaps a little… uncomfortable, from eating a large lunch, but nothing painful. I’ve always had a rather… sensitive stomach. There. That’s a little… firm. But I think that’s just gas, honestly.
DOCTOR: The firmness is localized in the lower right quadrant. Now, I am assessing your range of motion. Please reach your arms overhead. Range of motion appears full, though slightly limited due to… reluctance. Do you have any history of skin conditions, allergies, or current medications?
PATIENT: Oh! No, Doctor. No history of skin conditions, allergies, or… medications. Except for the daily multivitamin, as I mentioned before. Just a standard one, nothing prescribed. My shoulder’s been a little stiff lately, from lifting heavy pots at work. Perhaps that’s why my range of motion isn’t quite… optimal.
DOCTOR: A daily multivitamin. Right. And this shoulder stiffness is recent?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe so. It started… within the past month, perhaps a little longer. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s hardly noticeable, and others it’s… a bit more uncomfortable. I’ve been trying to stretch it out, but… it hasn’t improved much. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to recall precise details.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, with all due respect, your lack of specific medical information and vague responses are… concerning. Based on this preliminary examination, and lacking details about your planned surgery, I cannot provide a surgical clearance at this time. I recommend you obtain the details of the procedure and consult with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. I suggest you have a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a thorough cardiovascular workup. Furthermore, I advise you to schedule an appointment with a physical therapist to address your shoulder stiffness.
