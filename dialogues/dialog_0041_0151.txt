DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling. It's mostly in my hands and feet, you know? Been going on for… a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… comes and goes, you said. And you’re not sure how long exactly it’s been happening?
PATIENT: No, not really. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? Hard to say with everything going on. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… annoying. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad, and it happens in my hands too.
DOCTOR: Right, annoying is a good way to put it. Not painful, just a bothersome tingling. And it’s happening in both your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though… I think it's a little worse in my feet, sometimes. Makes walking a bit… strange. I try not to think about it too much, honestly. I got a lot of mail to deliver, you know? Can’t be stopping to worry about little tingles all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little worse in the feet, affecting your walking some. You're a mail carrier, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Postal Service. Been doing it a long time. Lots of walking, lots of being on my feet. It’s good work, keeps me moving, but… well. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Possibly. Being on your feet a lot can definitely contribute to things. Do you notice if the tingling gets worse after a long day of work, or with certain activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Definitely worse at the end of the day. When I finally sit down… that’s when I really notice it. And if I’ve been standing for a long time in one spot, like waiting for a customer, it gets bad then too. It’s a little better when I'm resting, but it doesn’t ever completely go away, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with prolonged standing and at the end of the day, but resting doesn’t fully relieve it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little bit of… achiness in my legs sometimes? But I just figured that was from walking so much. I’m not really one for noticing little things, to be honest. Just trying to get the mail delivered.
DOCTOR: Okay, some achiness in your legs, which you attribute to your work. No other new symptoms?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Nothing else I can think of. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you listening, but I really need to get back to work if I can. Is this something serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll try to be quick. Let’s do a little exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I’ll check your reflexes, sensation, and circulation in your legs and feet. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a whole route to finish, you know? Just… be gentle, please? My feet are already tired.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your reflexes. Could you sit on the edge of the examination table, please, and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Okay. There.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now your ankles. Can you tell me if you can feel the vibration, and where?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel it. It’s… kind of hard to explain. It’s like a buzzing. I feel it mostly in my toes, but it’s a little… faint. Like it’s not as strong as it should be, maybe? And yes, it is fainter on this foot… the left one.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, the vibration sensation is fainter on your left foot. Now, can you tell me if you feel this, and is this different from this?
PATIENT: Yes, that one… that one feels a little… numb. Like, not painful, but… not quite right. And this one… yes, I feel that one, but it's a little dull. Everything feels… off, honestly. Like my feet aren't quite there anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. I don't see any obvious signs of injury or swelling. Your circulation seems okay, but your sensation is definitely reduced in both feet, more noticeably on the left. Given your symptoms – the tingling, the numbness, the reduced sensation, and the fact that it’s worse with activity – it sounds like you might have peripheral neuropathy. That means there’s some damage to the nerves in your feet. It can be caused by a lot of things, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and sometimes even just prolonged pressure on the nerves.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Diabetes? I don't have diabetes. Never been told that, anyway. Vitamin… oh dear. I probably don't eat enough vegetables. Look, Doctor, is this… serious? Am I going to have to stop working?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take things one step at a time. Peripheral neuropathy just means there’s some irritation or damage to the nerves in your feet and legs. It doesn't automatically mean diabetes, although it can be a symptom. We should check your blood sugar to rule that out. As for stopping work, not necessarily. But we need to figure out the cause and manage it so it doesn’t get worse. I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel , and a vitamin B12 level. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Also, since you’re a mail carrier, and spending a lot of time on your feet, I recommend seeing a podiatrist to get a proper assessment of your feet and make sure your shoes are providing adequate support.
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests. A podiatrist… That’s a lot. Will the tests take long? And is this going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. The blood tests shouldn’t take too long – just a quick visit to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. As for the cost, I can write you a prescription for the blood tests, and the lab should have a payment plan or a sliding scale based on your income. I can also give you a list of local labs that offer more affordable testing options. Regarding the podiatrist, they can assess your feet for any structural problems or pressure points that might be contributing to the neuropathy. It’s important to get proper footwear and orthotics if needed. Some podiatrists also offer payment plans or sliding scale fees. I can give you some referrals to podiatrists in the area who are known for being affordable. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing if possible, and make sure you're wearing comfortable, supportive shoes. We also need to talk about your diet, and make sure you're getting enough B vitamins. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. That… sounds like a lot, but I suppose I have to do something. Blood tests, find a podiatrist… B vitamins… Okay. Could you… write down those referrals and the lab information? My memory isn’t what it used to be. And could you write down a few things I can eat to get more of those… B vitamins? I really need to get back to work now, though.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, here are a few podiatrist referrals in the area – Dr. Anya Petrova, and Dr. Ivan Volkov. Both have good reputations and are familiar with working with patients on a budget. Here's also a list of local labs that offer affordable testing. And for B vitamins, you can find them in foods like eggs, lean meats , fish, whole grains, and dark leafy green vegetables. Supplementation is also an option, but let’s see what your blood tests show first. We'll take it one step at a time, Teretha. Get these tests done, and we’ll go from there. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, if you experience any severe pain, weakness, or loss of balance, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening. I just… needed to know what was going on. I’ve got a lot of mail to deliver. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and be careful out there. .
