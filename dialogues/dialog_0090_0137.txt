DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? I need paper for that. My son, he say I need check-up first. For the… senior living.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. A placement evaluation. Your son is quite right, we do need to get a baseline check-up done first. It’s standard procedure. So, let’s start with why you feel you might need to be in a… “senior living” facility, as you put it. Are you having trouble with things at home?
PATIENT: Trouble… not big trouble. Just… getting older. I live with my husband, you know? He is good man, but he… he slow down too. We both slow down. Cooking is hard sometimes. Cleaning… forget things. Not all the time, but… happens.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some difficulties with activities of daily living. And memory lapses, you say. How long have you been noticing these… lapses?
PATIENT: Lapses… maybe six months? A year? Hard to say. My son, he notice more than me, I think. He say I repeat myself. I don’t… I don’t always remember what I eat for lunch. Little things. Not… big important things. Like my name. I remember my name!
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you're aware of some changes. And your son is observant, that’s helpful. Let’s try to get a more specific picture. Besides cooking and cleaning, are you having any difficulty managing your medications?
PATIENT: Medications… oh. That is… sometimes hard. I take a pill for my water, you know? And one for my heart. My son, he put them in little boxes. Every day. But… sometimes I forget if I take it. Or I think I take it, but maybe I don’t. It makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. So some difficulty with medication adherence. We’ll need to address that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Mood… hmm. I get sad sometimes. But who doesn't? My daughter… she gone now, you know? A long time ago. I miss her. But… I have my son. And my husband. I try to be happy. But… some days are hard.
DOCTOR: I see. Grief is a powerful thing, and it can certainly affect your overall well-being. And while some sadness is normal, prolonged or severe mood changes can be important to address. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. I have the water problem. Doctor say high blood pressure. And… my feet hurt sometimes. Arthritis, he say. Old age hurts, you know? I don’t remember all the names. I just know I take pills. A lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Right. So, hypertension, arthritis, and you mentioned a “water problem” – is that edema, swelling in your legs and feet?
PATIENT: Edema… maybe? Yes, my feet swell. Especially in the evening. And… sometimes I have to go to the bathroom many times at night. It bother my husband. He have to get up. I feel bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll address that as well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Long time ago, I have baby. That is surgery, right? And… when I was young, I break my arm. They fix it. But… no big surgeries, I don’t think. Not in a long time. Maybe? I forget.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my husband, like I say. My son, he live close. He help a lot. And… my daughter, she gone. My mother… she gone a long time ago. My father… I don't remember him very well. He gone when I was small. We have many cousins, but I don't see them much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she have the heart problem. And… my sister, she have the… the shaky hands. Doctor say it run in the family. My son worry about that. He say I should tell you everything. Is that bad, Doctor? The shaky hands?
DOCTOR: Well, a family history of tremors is something we need to note. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop it, but it's important information. Let’s move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't think so. I eat everything. Maybe a little bit sensitive to the cold. I get a cough sometimes. But… no bad allergies. Nothing I can't take medicine for. I don't remember being allergic to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Careful now, old bones. Is this good? Am I standing okay?
DOCTOR: Your pulse is a little fast, and your blood pressure is elevated, as expected. Your lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but not concerning at this time. Let me see your hands. Any swelling or pain in your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My hands hurt sometimes. Especially in the morning. See? They are stiff. And… they ache. It’s worse when it’s cold. Or when I’ve been… using them a lot. Cooking, you know? Makes it hard to hold things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some swelling and tenderness in your knuckles. Consistent with arthritis. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Careful… careful now. My legs… they don’t always listen to me. Is this good? Am I walking okay? It feels a little… wobbly.
DOCTOR: Your gait is a little slow and unsteady, and you have a slightly wide-based stance. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Now, let's sit back down.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… hard to balance sometimes. I don’t fall much, but… I worry about falling. My son, he says I need a walker. But… I don’t want a walker. Feels like… giving up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, you have some typical age-related changes – some difficulty with memory, some arthritis, elevated blood pressure, and some balance issues. I’m going to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out anything else. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. And I'd like you to see a physical therapist for a gait assessment and recommendations for improving your balance. As for the walker… we can discuss that after the physical therapy evaluation. We'll see what they recommend. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, okay. Physical therapy… I don't know. Will it hurt? I don’t want it to hurt. And… the senior living… is it okay if I wait a little bit? Before I decide? I just want to be sure. My son, he’s very worried. He wants me to be safe. Is it bad, Doctor? Am I… too old to stay home?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Abdollahi, you're not "too old" to stay home. But we need to ensure it is safe for you. The blood work and physical therapy are simply to help us determine that. The physical therapist can recommend exercises to improve your balance and strength, and possibly suggest assistive devices if needed. It won't necessarily involve pain. And as for the senior living… we don't need to make any decisions right now. Let’s get these tests done first, and then we can revisit the conversation. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood work and the physical therapy. The nurse will go over the instructions with you before you leave. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Blood work… and… physical therapy. The nurse will help me? That’s good. Thank you. I… I just want to be safe. And… I want my son to be happy. Is that too much to ask? Will the tests tell me… if I can stay home?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us assess your current condition and identify any potential risks. It will give us a better understanding of what support you might need to continue living independently. It won’t be a simple “yes” or “no” answer, but it will provide valuable information for making an informed decision. I’ll have the nurse explain everything in more detail before you leave. Now, are there any other questions or concerns you have at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you for listening. And… thank you for not saying I’m too old. I just want to take things one day at a time. Where is the nurse?
DOCTOR: She’ll be with you shortly, Mrs. Abdollahi. Just sit tight. I’ll have her go over discharge instructions and schedule the lab work and physical therapy. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
