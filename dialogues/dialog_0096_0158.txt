DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris, yes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, hello. It's about... a letter. For my dog. A pet ownership letter, that's right. It’s for… well, you know, where I live. They’re being difficult. Honestly, some people just don’t understand a good animal when they see one.
DOCTOR: A letter… for your dog. Right. And this… impacts your housing situation, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Impacts it? Heavily! They're saying… something about breeds. Honestly, it's ridiculous. He's a lovely dog. Very well-behaved, mostly. A bit of energy, you know, but what dog doesn't have energy? They just don’t seem to get it. It’s a perfectly good building, and he's a perfectly good dog. I don't know what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: So, this building has restrictions on certain breeds?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s exactly it. Restrictions. Some nonsense about insurance and… well, I didn’t really listen to the details, to be honest. It was a lot of… complaining. Mostly about big dogs. He's… medium-sized, I suppose. Not huge. Perfectly manageable. It’s just… they’re making it very difficult. And I need the letter to prove he's… acceptable. Is that what you do? Write letters like that?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a medical doctor. I don't typically write letters about… pet suitability for housing. However, sometimes a documented assessment of an animal’s temperament can be helpful. Tell me about this dog. What breed is he?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A medical doctor. I suppose I just assumed… well, never mind. Breed… hmm. That’s a good question, actually. He was a rescue, you see. They didn't say for certain. The lady at the shelter thought he might have some… Boxer in him? Maybe some… I don’t know, something fluffy? He's brown, mostly. And strong. A very strong boy. He likes to play fetch. A lot. Does that help? Honestly, I'm terrible with breeds. I just know he's a good dog.
DOCTOR: "Some Boxer," "something fluffy." Right. And how long have you had him?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's been a little over a year now, I think. Maybe a year and three months? It feels like forever, honestly. He just… showed up, practically. Well, not showed up, but I went to the shelter and… he chose me. He was the one, you know? He was looking at me with those eyes, and I just had to take him. A lovely dog, really. Very loyal. He follows me everywhere. Except when there’s squirrels. Then all bets are off.
DOCTOR: And has he ever… bitten anyone?
PATIENT: Bitten? Oh, goodness, no! Never! He's a bit… enthusiastic, sometimes. He gets excited and jumps up, and once he accidentally knocked over a small table at a friend's house, but that wasn’t biting! Just… a bit clumsy. He’s not aggressive, not at all. He just… loves people. Maybe a little too much, sometimes. He does have strong teeth, though. A very strong boy, as I said. But he's never hurt anyone, absolutely not.
DOCTOR: And does he have any… behavioral issues?
PATIENT: Behavioral issues? Hmm. Well, he barks at the mailman. Every day. Without fail. But that’s just protecting the house, isn’t it? A good dog protects his home. And… he pulls on the leash a bit when we’re walking. But I think that’s my fault, I should probably get a better leash. He’s just excited to go for walks! He loves walks. Honestly, I wouldn’t call those issues. Just… normal dog things, really.
DOCTOR: Right. So, barking at the mailman and pulling on the leash. And you want me to write a letter stating this dog is… suitable for housing?
PATIENT: Well, I mean, yes. I just… they’re being difficult, you see? And you’re a doctor! You write letters. And he is a good dog, despite a little barking and leash-pulling. He doesn’t cause any trouble, really. I just need them to understand that. He's a loving companion, and he deserves a home, and I deserve to keep him. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Wrye, I understand you're frustrated. However, a medical assessment of a dog’s temperament isn’t typically within my scope of practice. And frankly, describing barking and leash-pulling as minor issues… doesn’t paint a picture of a dog that would necessarily be considered reliably well-behaved. I could, perhaps, document that you report no history of biting, but a letter stating suitability for housing… I’m hesitant. It could create liability issues for both of us. Have you considered consulting a certified veterinary behaviorist?
PATIENT: Veterinary… what now? Oh, goodness. No, I haven't. That sounds… expensive. And complicated. I just thought… a doctor’s letter would be enough. You know, official. But liability issues? Goodness. I didn't even think about that. Honestly, this is just a nightmare. I just want to be left alone with my dog. Perhaps... could you just write something saying he's healthy? That might help. If he's healthy, they can't complain, can they?
DOCTOR: I can document a basic physical exam, yes. But a healthy dog is not automatically a well-behaved dog, Mrs. Wrye. Let’s proceed with the exam then. I'll listen to his heart and lungs, check his reflexes. But please understand this won't address the behavioral concerns you've described. And it’s unlikely to resolve the issues with your housing situation. Do you have him with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I suppose. A healthy dog... well, that’s a start, isn’t it? He is a very healthy boy. Mostly. He had a bit of an upset stomach last month, but that was just something he ate in the park, I think. Probably a bad stick. He loves sticks. No, he's not here with me now. I didn't want to bother the other patients. He's… enthusiastic, as I said. Best to leave him at home, really. So, a heart and lungs exam? Is that all?
DOCTOR: For now, yes. Let’s start with his medical history. Has he been vaccinated?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Absolutely. I always make sure he's up to date on everything. I take him to Dr. Abernathy, down the street. Lovely man, very thorough. He’s got a… a chart, you know, with all the little stickers. I think he got his last booster in… hmm. February, maybe? Or was it March? I really should look at the chart, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. He's a healthy boy, though, I promise! They always say so at the vet's office.
DOCTOR: “Approximately February or March.” Right. And has he had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that! Just… that upset stomach, as I said. And once he licked something funny off the pavement and threw up a bit, but that wasn't an illness, was it? Just… a bad taste, I think. He's a very resilient boy, really. Doesn’t let anything bother him. Dr. Abernathy said he’s in excellent condition, last time we went. He even gave him a little treat! A biscuit, I think. He loves biscuits. Honestly, he’s a picture of health.
DOCTOR: And does he receive any preventative medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! For… for fleas and… things. You know. Little… crawling things. Dr. Abernathy prescribes them. Little pills. He gets one every month. Or maybe every six weeks? I give them to him with a little bit of peanut butter. He loves peanut butter! It makes it easier. Honestly, I try to be very careful with him. He's my best friend, you see. I want to keep him safe and healthy. So, yes, he gets all the little pills. Everything he needs.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Wrye. While I can document that you report a history of preventative medications, vaccinations, and no major illnesses, this is not a comprehensive medical assessment. This information is limited by your recollection, and frankly, doesn't address the behavioral concerns you raised. Is there anything else you think I should know about his medical history before I proceed with the basic physical exam?
PATIENT: Goodness. Well… he did eat a sock once. A small sock. It came out alright, though! Dr. Abernathy said his tummy was a bit upset for a day, but everything went through okay. He shouldn't have eaten it, of course. I told him off for it. A very naughty boy. And… oh! He once stepped on a Lego. Very dramatic, he was. Limped around for a bit, but it was fine. Honestly, he's a bit of a drama queen sometimes. But other than that… no. I think that’s everything. Really. He's just a good boy. A bit of a handful, but a good boy. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Right. A sock and a Lego. Okay. Let’s proceed with the physical exam then. I'll need to listen to his heart and lungs, check his temperature, and palpate his abdomen. If you'll please roll up your sleeves... just so I can document your report of a healthy animal.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sleeves… yes. Here we go. Honestly, he's probably healthier than most people I know. He gets so much exercise, running around and… well, eating socks. It's a miracle he's still with us, really. But he's a fighter, that boy. A very strong boy. And he’s got a lovely coat, you know. Very shiny. Dr. Abernathy always comments on it.
DOCTOR: Heart rate and lung sounds within normal limits, based on my brief auscultation. Abdomen appears soft to palpation, but this is limited by your report. Temperature difficult to assess without actually examining the animal. So, to summarize, you report a healthy animal with a history of… dietary indiscretions and a predilection for small, non-food items. Is there anything else I should document?
PATIENT: Dietary… what now? Oh. Yes. He does like to try everything. And the small items… well, he's just curious, isn't he? A very inquisitive boy. Let me see… Oh! He does shed a lot. Especially in the spring. It gets everywhere, honestly. You’d think he was a giant fluffy animal, but he’s not that big. And… he snores. Very loudly. My neighbors have commented on it. But it’s a comforting sound, really. He’s just… a lot. A very big personality in a medium-sized package. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wrye, with all due respect, I can document that you report a history of shedding and snoring. However, this is not a medical examination, and a letter stating suitability for housing based on this information would be… irresponsible. I recommend consulting a certified veterinary behaviorist for a comprehensive assessment of his temperament and behavioral issues. I can provide you with a referral if you’d like. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A… behaviorist? Oh, goodness. That sounds expensive. And… complicated. Honestly, I just wanted a letter. A simple letter. I just… I don’t want to lose him. He’s the best friend I’ve got. Is there anything you can write? Even just to say he’s healthy? Please? I’ll try to keep him away from socks, I promise. And Legos. And maybe even the mailman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Wrye. I will document a basic physical exam finding of “healthy appearance based on patient report, with noted shedding.” However, please understand this does not address the behavioral concerns you’ve raised, and it is unlikely to resolve the issues with your housing situation. I strongly advise seeking a professional behavioral assessment. I’ll print this out for you now. And I will provide you with a list of local veterinary behaviorists. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Even just a little something is better than nothing. I'll definitely try to keep him away from the mailman. And the socks. And... everything. Hopefully, this will be enough. Thank you again. You’ve been very… patient.
DOCTOR: Here you are. As I said, this is a limited assessment based on your report. I wish you the best of luck with your housing situation. And here’s the list of veterinary behaviorists. Don’t hesitate to contact them if you’re concerned about his behavior. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you. Really. I appreciate your time. And your patience. I’ll… try to keep him out of trouble. Hopefully, this will work. Thank you again. Goodbye.
