DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it's... the waterworks again, I suppose. Seems to bother me often. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, just that it does. It's quite bothersome, really. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: "The waterworks," right. Well, let's try to get a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh dear. I… I don’t understand. What do you need to know specifically? It hurts when I… go to the bathroom. That’s all I really know. It burns, sometimes. And I have to go so often. Is that specific enough? I truly don’t recall much else. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Burning, frequent urination… that is something. But “often” is rather vague, Ms. Wease. Could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An estimate… Well, let me think. More than usual, certainly. Probably… every hour or two during the day? Perhaps even more. I drink a fair amount of water, you see, so it stands to reason. But it’s still… disruptive. I just want it to stop, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? I haven’t been sleeping well, either. I keep getting up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination, waking you at night… and how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult question. A while. Months, I believe? Perhaps even… longer? It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s much worse. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started being this bad again. I truly don’t have a good memory for dates, Doctor. I apologize. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It's…helpful, Ms. Wease. It helps us rule things out. Months… alright. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, my goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen. I… I don't examine it closely, if you understand. It just… hurts. I don't pay attention to color, Doctor. I just want the pain to go away. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. It’s… unpleasant. I suppose if there was blood, I would have noticed, but I haven’t. I hope not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don’t think so. I haven't been feeling poorly, just… uncomfortable. Chills… no. Back pain… well, I have a bit of an ache in my back sometimes, but that’s just my age, I suspect. It’s not related to… the waterworks, I don’t believe. It’s just old age catching up with me, Doctor. I’m 66, you see. Things ache. Is there something wrong with me? I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wease, it could be a simple urinary tract infection, which is quite common. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you ever had a UTI before?
PATIENT: A… UTI? Oh dear. I’ve had all sorts of things over the years, I suppose. I honestly can’t remember. I’ve been to many doctors. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. I think I might have had something similar before, a long time ago, but I can’t be certain. I’m not very good at remembering medical things. It’s all just… unpleasant. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I just want this to be over with, quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the best course of action is to do a urine test, just to be sure. It's a simple procedure. Then we'll see what that tells us. Let's go ahead and get a sample now. I’ll have the nurse come in and show you how to collect it.
PATIENT: Oh, a test… alright. As long as it’s quick. I haven’t much time, you see. I have things to do. A nurse? Very well. Just… please make it quick, Doctor. I don’t like being poked and prodded. I'm not feeling very well, as you know. And please explain it clearly to the nurse, she may need to repeat it several times. I don't hear very well, either.
DOCTOR: I'll have her come in right away. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Wease. Shouldn’t take long. Just a routine urine sample. I’ll leave you to it.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I hope it is simple. And that it's over quickly. I really must be going soon.
