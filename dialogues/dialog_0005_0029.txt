DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. So, you’re here today… why don’t you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this… feeling full after just a little bit of food. It's been going on for a while now, maybe a month or so. Not a lot of pain, just… stop feeling hungry real quick, even if I haven’t eaten much. It’s kinda worrying, to be honest. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know?
DOCTOR: A month, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly, time kinda… slips away when you get to be my age. But it definitely wasn't happening a couple months back. It's just… weird. I’ll eat a few bites of something, and then I just… don't want any more. Even if it's something I like.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this with all foods?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yeah. Doesn't seem to matter. Soup, fish, even my wife's amazing bannock… usually I can eat a whole pile of that, but now? A couple of pieces and I’m done. It’s not like I'm sick to my stomach or anything, just… not hungry anymore. Makes me worry I’m losing weight, though I haven’t checked lately.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, getting old comes with a few aches and pains, but that’s just… normal, right? I'm not tired any more than usual, and my… well, everything else seems to be working okay. Just this full feeling. It's more of a… frustration, I guess. Used to enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any trouble… passing gas?
PATIENT: Well now, doc, that's a… personal question! But… no, not really. Everything's moving along, if you get my drift. No blockages or anything like that. Just… full, quickly. Seems strange, doesn't it? I thought maybe it was something I ate, but it's been happening with everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements – darker stools, diarrhea, constipation – anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No sickness, no… upset. Everything goes in and, well, comes out… regular. Stools are normal color, normal… consistency. I haven't noticed any blood or anything scary like that. Just this darned fullness. It's not painful, just… inconvenient. And worrying, to be honest. My wife keeps fussing over me, asking if I'm sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some basics down. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, doc. I had a bit of a bad cold a few years back, but nothing serious. High blood pressure, maybe, the doctor mentioned it once, but I don't take anything for it. Just try to take it easy, you know? Nothing major, never been in the hospital or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I think. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I remember. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think… but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. Never broken a bone, never had anything serious enough to need an operation. I’m a pretty tough old Haida man, you know? Mostly just scrapes and bruises over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Like I said, just nothing for the blood pressure. Occasionally a painkiller for my joints, but that's about it. A couple of ibuprofen now and then, if they're really bothering me. And… that’s it. No regular prescriptions, nothing like that. I try to avoid pills if I can, you know? Never really liked taking them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, doc. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. My old bones ain’t what they used to be, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please… in and out… good. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No pain, doc. Just… feels normal, I guess. A little tender maybe, but that’s probably just from… getting old. It doesn’t hurt or anything, just… feels a bit sensitive. You're pressing pretty hard though, doc! Not trying to be difficult, just saying. It’s a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Mr. Obarr. Just trying to get a good feel. Alright. No masses detected. I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Sounds are… present, but slightly diminished. Not alarming, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, doc. Sounds good. Diminished sounds, you say? Is that… bad? I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s just… this fullness is worrying me. And my wife is starting to fuss even more. Checking my reflexes sounds… okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… a little sluggish, but not significantly. This could be related to age, or… a number of things. Mr. Obarr, based on what you’ve told me and the limited examination I’ve performed, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your early satiety. However, given your age and the diminished bowel sounds, there are a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a mild digestive issue. But, given your lack of appetite and the possibility of diminished bowel function, we need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Serious? What do you mean, serious? Like… what kind of serious? My wife… she’ll be beside herself. Is it… is it something with my stomach? I just want to be able to eat a normal meal again, doc. You’re scaring me a little here. What do we need to do? Tests, you said? What kind of tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, let’s not jump to conclusions. "Serious" is a broad term. I want to rule out a few possibilities. We’ll need to order some blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. We should also get a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. And, to get a better look at your digestive system, I’m going to recommend a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will help us determine if there's anything obstructing your digestive tract or if there’s any sign of a more serious underlying condition. It's important to get this checked out, just to be on the safe side. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: CT scan… that sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. Will it hurt? And what exactly are we looking for? You said something about obstruction? Is something… blocked? And blood work… I hate needles. My wife… she’ll have to come with me, I think. She’s good with all this medical stuff. And I don't have insurance, doc. Will this be… costly? I just… I'm worried about all this. Can we at least start with the blood work? And explain a little more about this scan… what exactly is involved?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, let’s take it one step at a time. The CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdominal organs. It's not usually painful, you'll just lie on a table while the machine scans your body. It does involve some radiation, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. As for what we're looking for… we want to rule out things like bowel obstructions – a blockage in your intestines – as well as any signs of tumors or other abnormalities. Regarding the blood work, yes, it does involve a needle, but it’s relatively quick. As for the cost… I understand your concern. Unfortunately, medical testing can be expensive. I’ll have my staff provide you with an itemized cost estimate for each test. We can also discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs. I'll be honest with you, given your age and symptoms, it's important to get this thoroughly investigated. Delaying diagnosis could lead to more serious complications down the line. Let's start with the blood work and stool sample. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible, and then we’ll discuss the next steps – including the CT scan – in more detail. I'll have the staff draw the blood now, and give you the container for the stool sample. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright… blood work and stool sample. Yes, that’s… acceptable. As long as you explain everything clearly, and we can talk about the cost. And please… tell my wife everything too, okay? She worries. Where do I go for the blood work? And what do I… do with the stool sample? Is there a special container? I just… I’m a bit overwhelmed, doc. This is a lot to take in. But thank you… for explaining everything. And for not dismissing my concerns.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Obarr. I completely understand. It is a lot. My staff will walk you through the entire process. They’ll provide you with a requisition form for the blood work and the special container for the stool sample. The blood work can be done at the lab just across the street – they take walk-ins, but it’s best to arrive before 3 pm. As for the stool sample, the staff will give you specific instructions on how to collect it properly. It's important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. And yes, I will make sure to explain everything thoroughly to your wife as well. She’s welcome to sit in on our next appointment, or I can call her directly with an update. Let me just print out these forms for you… and here’s the number for the lab. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, next week is fine. Thank you, doc. Thank you… for listening, and for not making me feel like I'm just an old man worrying over nothing. I'll go get the blood work done now, and try not to stress too much. And I'll be sure to follow the instructions for the… sample. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Tell your staff I said hello, and thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. 88-year-old male… early satiety… diminished bowel sounds… need to rule out obstruction. Let's hope it's nothing too serious. . .
