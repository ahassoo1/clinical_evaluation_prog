DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. A dull ache at the back of your head for three days, coming and going. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It doesn’t seem to be when I’m doing anything special. Sometimes when I’m just sitting… sometimes when I walk a little. Hard to say, really. I used to work on the trains, you know? Lots of… moving things around. Maybe from that? I don't know. It just… starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see you had a career with the railways. That could be relevant, yes. And it’s not consistently linked to any activity. When you say it “starts,” can you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Never really done that before. Let me think… When it’s bad… maybe a four? Not terrible, but I notice it. Most of the time it's more like a two, maybe even a one. Just… there. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it's… annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A four at its worst, usually a one or two. And it doesn’t radiate, meaning doesn't spread to other areas like your neck or face?
PATIENT: Radiate? Does that mean… go somewhere else? No, I don’t think so. It stays right in the back of my head. Sometimes I feel a little… tight… in my shoulders, but I always have a little trouble with my shoulders. Old age, you know? Not sure if that's the same thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's localized to the back of your head, no spreading pain. And the shoulder tightness… that might be related, or might not be. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No… no dizziness. Not sick to my stomach. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe I wake up a little more than I used to, but that could just be getting old. I haven't seen any… spots or blurry vision, nothing like that. Oh! Sometimes I feel a little… tired. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I am supposed to be tired.
DOCTOR: Right, naturally some fatigue at your age is expected. No nausea, no visual disturbances, no dizziness… Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not exactly like this. I get little aches sometimes, you know? Just like a normal headache. But this… this is different. It's more constant, even when it's not bad. And it's always in the same place. Back of my head. Never had something that stayed like this before. Maybe a week? I hope not.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're noticing the difference. Let’s just do a quick examination, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what to do. Slow and easy, if you don’t mind. My eyes aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just follow my finger with your eyes, keep your head still… excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here. Is that okay? Not as strong as I used to be, I imagine. Old age again. Everything is… slower.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we’re just getting a baseline. A little weaker on one side, but not drastically. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relax my legs… Ooh, that was… a little jumpy. Not used to that. Everything feels… sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little more sensitive on that side. Nothing too concerning, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingling. Everything feels… well, old. Achy, sometimes, but not numb. I can feel my hands and feet just fine. Haven’t lost that yet, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No numbness or tingling. So, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick examination, the headache could be a number of things. Given your age and the slight weakness I noticed, I want to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a CT scan of your head, just to make sure there’s nothing going on structurally. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan… is that like an X-ray? I had one of those years ago for my chest. Not fun, you know? All that… machine noise. Is it going to take long? And… will it cost a lot of money? I don't have… insurance, you see. It’s just… me, now.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is similar to an X-ray, yes, but it provides more detailed images. It will take about 15-20 minutes. I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Brum. I’ll have the billing department look into options for you, and we can discuss potential financial assistance programs. I’m also going to order some bloodwork, just to check your overall health. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have those results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, Doctor. As long as it doesn't cost too much. I appreciate you looking into that for me. Bloodwork… okay. Just… tell me when and where, and I’ll be there. I want to get this headache figured out. It’s just… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here are the orders for the CT scan and bloodwork. The scan is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. The bloodwork can be done any time at the lab next door. The lab and imaging center both take walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to avoid a wait. I’ll also have my nurse, Maria, give you a list of resources for financial assistance. We'll review the results next week. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Tomorrow at nine… okay. Across the street. I think I can remember that. Walk-in… good. I don’t like waiting too long. And Maria will help with… the money? That’s very kind of her. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time. And for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little better, just knowing what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Brum. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Maria will be in touch. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment next week. Take care.
