DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s my joints, I think. They feel…stiff in the mornings. It’s been happening for a while now, but it's a little worse lately. I can’t quite remember when it started started, though. Just… always kinda been there, I guess?
DOCTOR: “Always kinda been there” isn’t terribly helpful, Ms. Voner. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, dear. Sorry. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe a year? Or two? Everything kinda blends together these days, you know? It's not a sharp pain, not really. Just… hard to get moving when I first wake up. It loosens up after a bit, after I'm up and about with the little ones. But getting started is the worst part. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: "Little ones?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, the children. I, uh… I watch children. A few families in the village. It keeps me busy, you know? It’s good work. But bending down to pick them up, or getting on the floor… that’s when I really feel it in my knees and my… my back, too, sometimes. Not all the time, just… when I'm doing things.
DOCTOR: So, primarily morning stiffness, worse with activity like bending and lifting, and improves throughout the day. Any swelling or redness in the joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. They don’t look puffy, do they? Sometimes they feel warm, but that could just be from, you know… moving around with the children all day. It’s summer, it's hot! I’m not sure if that’s related or not. I really don’t know much about… well, anything like this, really.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any pain in other joints?
PATIENT: Other joints…? Well… my hands ache a little sometimes. Especially after I've been… playing with the blocks, or coloring with the children. But it's not… constant, you know? It comes and goes. And my back, like I said before. But that’s mostly when I bend over. It doesn't hurt just sitting or anything. Is that… helpful? I’m trying to remember everything, but it’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical… Oh dear… Let me see. I had… my appendix out, a long, long time ago. When I was young. And… My husband… he passed away a few years back. But that wasn’t a medical problem, of course. Just… sad. I don't really go to the doctor much. Nothing serious has ever happened, until… well, until now, maybe. I'm not sure. I can't remember much about being sick.
DOCTOR: And no other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no hospitalizations. Not that I recall. Just the appendix when I was a girl. It was… a long time ago. Everything feels so blurry when I try to remember things from back then. My husband… he took care of all the doctor appointments, mostly. I just… let him handle it. He was very organized. It’s silly, I know. I should probably know these things. But I just… didn’t.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. No, not really. I take a little something for my… my water retention sometimes. The doctor gave it to me a while back. But I don't take it every day, just when I’m feeling a bit… puffy, you know? I don't even remember the name of it, I’m afraid. Just a little white pill. It’s in the kitchen, I think. Somewhere. I really am not very good at this, am I?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's all. No, I don't think so. My husband always said I was a tough Greek girl, never bothered by anything! He was a good man. But allergies… no, I don't think I have any.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam now. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. An exam, you say? Yes, of course. Is this comfortable enough? It feels a little… hard. But I’m alright. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling some mild clicking in your knees, and they're a little stiff when I move them. Your wrists feel fine, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you feel any pain right now with these movements?
PATIENT: Oh, the clicking… yes, I do feel that sometimes. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a little uncomfortable. Like something is rubbing together. And yes, moving them like that, bending and straightening… that's where I feel it the most. Not all the time, but it's definitely worse when you push them like that. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily bad, Ms. Voner, but it's consistent with some degree of joint wear and tear. We need to rule out other possibilities. Given your history, age, and exam findings, the most likely scenario is osteoarthritis, but we can’t confirm that without some imaging. I’m going to order some X-rays of your knees and wrists. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh dear… I've never had an X-ray before. Are they… safe? Will it hurt? I don't like the sound of this… But if you think it’s necessary… then alright, I suppose. Just… please be gentle. And tell me what I need to do. I'm a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: They’re perfectly safe, Ms. Voner. It’s a very low dose of radiation, much less than you get from a cross-country flight. And it doesn’t hurt at all – you’ll just need to hold very still for a few seconds while the machine takes the pictures. The technician will explain everything to you in detail, but basically, you’ll lie on a table, and the machine will pass over your knees and wrists. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Do you have any metal implants in your knees or wrists, such as from previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Metal implants? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. Like I said, I’ve never had any surgeries on my knees or wrists. Just the appendix when I was a girl. No metal, nothing at all. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. I haven’t had much done to me, thankfully. So, X-rays, you say? Alright, let’s get it over with, I suppose. The sooner we know what's going on, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the technician come in and get you set up. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever – naproxen – to help manage any discomfort. It’s an over-the-counter medication, but a stronger dose might be beneficial while we wait for the X-ray results. Also, I recommend starting some gentle exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees and wrists. I’ll give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Naproxen… and exercises? Yes, that sounds… alright. I've taken naproxen before, for little aches and pains. It helps a little, sometimes. And exercises… well, I'm not very active these days. But I suppose I can try. I'll do my best, Doctor. Anything to feel a little better. A handout would be helpful, yes. I tend to forget things easily, so a written reminder would be very kind. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to recap: I’m ordering X-rays of your knees and wrists to rule out osteoarthritis and other possible causes of your joint pain. I’ve prescribed naproxen to manage any discomfort, and I’ve given you a handout with some exercises you can start at home. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… X-rays, naproxen, exercises… It's a lot to take in. Hmm… I suppose… How long will it take to get the X-ray results? And… will the exercises be painful? I don't want to make things worse. And… Is this something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: The X-ray results should be available within 24-48 hours. The technician will give you a card with instructions on how to access them online, or you can call the clinic, and we’ll let you know as soon as they're in. As for the exercises, start slowly and gently. You should feel a mild stretch, but no pain. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. And to answer your question… it’s unlikely to be anything serious, Ms. Voner. The most probable cause is osteoarthritis, which is a common condition, especially with age. It's manageable with medication, exercise, and lifestyle modifications. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with the X-rays, just to be sure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: 24-48 hours… online… no pain… osteoarthritis… manageable… That… that sounds a little better, yes. Not serious, you say? Just… old age? Well, I am getting on in years, I suppose. But it's good to know it's not something terrible. And manageable… that's good. I can handle manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I’ll try the exercises, and I’ll take the naproxen. And I’ll wait for the X-ray results. Thank you again. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Voner. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, start slowly with the exercises, and listen to your body. Have a good day, and I’ll see you again once the results are in.
