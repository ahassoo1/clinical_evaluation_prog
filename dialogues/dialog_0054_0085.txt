DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my skin. It’s just… not right. Patches, you see? And not the kind you get from the sun, though I do try to be careful. It’s just… bothersome, really. And frankly, it’s not a good look.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not right” and bothersome… patches that aren’t related to sun exposure. That’s a good starting point. To help me understand a little better, could you describe these patches?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… lighter than the rest of my skin, mostly. Not white, exactly, more… faded. And they’re not all in one place. There’s one on my forearm, a small one on my cheek, and… honestly, I think there’s another starting on my hand. They don't itch, thankfully. I’d be much more upset if they were itchy. They just… are. It's very inconvenient, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, lighter patches, not white, scattered on your forearm, cheek, and possibly your hand. No itching, which is good. And they've just… appeared, you said?
PATIENT: Not exactly appeared overnight, Doctor. It was gradual. Started maybe… six months ago? Small at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just… a trick of the light, perhaps. Or my husband not noticing when I put enough lotion on. But they’ve gotten… more defined since then. I do keep a good skincare routine, you know. It’s just… not working, apparently.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradual onset, and you've noticed they've become more defined despite a good skincare routine. That’s helpful information. To get a better picture, have you noticed anything else associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Associated with them? What do you mean? Like, what would be associated with them? I haven’t been ill, not recently. I feel perfectly fine, aside from… this, of course. My appetite is normal. No fatigue. No… I haven’t noticed any hair loss, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just skin. And I expect it to be fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness, normal appetite, no fatigue, no hair loss. That’s good. Just the skin changes themselves. To be thorough, I’m going to ask a few broader questions. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, bowel habits, or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting somewhere. Doctor, with all due respect, are you implying I’m… unwell? I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. My energy is fine – I manage my household, I volunteer at the library… My bowel habits are… regular. And my weight? Steady. Perfectly steady. I weigh myself every morning, you know. It's important to maintain standards. I haven’t got time for all this questioning about things that aren’t even relevant.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed irrelevant, Ms. Bartock. I assure you, I'm not implying anything. I’m simply trying to gather a complete picture. Sometimes skin conditions can be a sign of underlying issues, and it's my job to rule those out. Let’s shift gears a bit. Have you noticed anything that seems to make these patches better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. When you put it that way… Very well. But I still maintain this is a waste of my time. No, I haven't noticed anything specific. Sunshine doesn’t seem to make them worse, and lotion doesn't help. I’ve tried several brands, mind you, quite expensive ones. And I haven’t been exposed to anything unusual. No new detergents, no new perfumes… honestly, my life is quite… contained. It's not like I'm traipsing through the jungle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, sunshine and lotion don’t seem to have an effect. A consistent routine, no new exposures… that’s good to know. And you say your lifestyle is contained, meaning relatively consistent. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? What possible relevance could my grandmother's complexion have to do with patches on my skin? Honestly. Very well, if you insist. My mother had… sensitive skin. Easily flushed, prone to redness. Nothing like this, mind you. My father… perfectly normal skin. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… I believe she had some sort of… eczema? But a very mild case. And that's all I can really recall, Doctor. We weren't a family to discuss such… ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitive skin in your mother, mild eczema in your grandmother on your mother’s side. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to take a look at those patches. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I’ve never been allergic to anything in my life. I eat everything, I use everything… perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but who isn't? My husband does have a bit of hay fever, but that's hardly relevant. Honestly, Doctor, I am a very… robust individual. I don't succumb to these… weaknesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I believe in maintaining a natural lifestyle, Doctor. I do not pollute my body with unnecessary chemicals. I occasionally take a vitamin C tablet during the winter months, for… preventative measures. And perhaps a multivitamin if I haven’t been eating enough fruit. But that's hardly a “medication,” is it? Honestly, I find all this questioning rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Bartock, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. It’s just standard procedure to gather as much information as possible. Alright. Now, if you don’t mind, I would like to take a look at those patches on your skin. Could you please roll up your sleeve and point out the one on your forearm?
PATIENT: There. You see? It's not terribly obvious, is it? But it’s… there. And quite unsightly. And don't think I haven't tried concealing it with makeup. It simply won't do.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is a slightly depigmented area, as you mentioned, with smooth texture and no discernible temperature difference. I also see the one on your cheek, and you mentioned a possible one on your hand. Let me take a look at your cheek. Yes, similar presentation on your cheek. Now, if you could show me your hand…
PATIENT: There. It's hardly noticeable, is it? It's just… starting, you see? I do hope it doesn’t spread. It would be simply dreadful. And it does interfere with my piano playing, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, a very small, faint patch, just starting. All three areas have a similar appearance. Based on what you've told me, and what I’m seeing on your skin, it’s possible this could be a condition called pityriasis alba. It’s a mild form of eczema that often causes slightly lighter patches of skin, particularly on the face, arms, and hands. It's more common in younger individuals, but can occur at any age. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to perform a simple skin scraping to examine under a microscope. It's a quick, painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A skin scraping? Honestly, Doctor. Is that truly necessary? It sounds… barbaric. I assure you, I have perfectly healthy skin otherwise. But… if you insist. If it's a quick and painless procedure, and if it will determine a definitive answer, then very well. But please be gentle. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want my skin to be… irritated.
DOCTOR: It will be very gentle, Ms. Bartock, I assure you. It simply involves gently scraping a tiny sample of skin cells to look at under the microscope. It’s completely painless and won’t irritate your skin. Alright. If you’ll just sit comfortably here, I’ll quickly perform the scraping on a small area of your forearm. It will only take a moment. Just a little pressure… there. And that’s it. Now I’ll prepare the sample for examination. Please bear with me for a moment while I examine it under the microscope.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is taking quite a long time. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And my luncheon reservation is in… well, let's just say I'm not pleased with the delay. Is there anything concerning you? Or can I simply go now and hope for the best?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the delay, Ms. Bartock. It’s important to be thorough. The microscopy doesn’t show any signs of fungal infection, and no bacterial elements. This supports my initial impression of pityriasis alba. It’s a common, benign condition, often seen in individuals with slightly sensitive skin. However, to confirm the diagnosis definitively and rule out any other rare possibilities, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your calcium levels and rule out any underlying systemic conditions. It's a standard precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather excessive, isn’t it? I came in about a few harmless patches of skin, and now you want to draw my blood? I haven't felt unwell, not in the slightest! Honestly, I think I've had enough of this. I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. Perhaps a good moisturizer will suffice. I'll just... thank you for your time, Doctor. I believe I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Bartock. However, my concern is always for your well-being, and ordering the blood test is simply a precaution to ensure an accurate diagnosis and rule out any underlying causes. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Without a definitive diagnosis, we cannot be certain about the cause of these patches, and there is a small possibility of a more serious underlying condition. If you are unwilling to proceed with the blood test, I can offer a prescription for a mild topical corticosteroid cream to help manage the appearance of the patches. However, it's important to understand that this will only address the symptoms and not the underlying cause. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I want you to be fully informed before making a choice. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. I'm here to help in any way I can. .
