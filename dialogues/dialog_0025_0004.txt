DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Fourney, it’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. My husband, Earl, said it was time for my shots. You know, the regular ones. I think I’m due for a tetanus booster, maybe? He keeps track of all that stuff. I’m not so good with dates and remembering when I last had things done.
DOCTOR: A check-up…and a tetanus booster, prompted by your husband. Right. Well, we’ll certainly get that sorted. It’s good he’s keeping track, though honestly, a responsible adult should know these things. Let’s start with a bit more detail. When was the last time you saw a doctor, if you recall, and what was that visit for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a while ago. Probably… hmm. Let me think. It wasn't for anything serious, just a little cold a couple of years back, maybe three? It was at the small clinic over in town, before they closed down. Dr. Peterson… I think that was his name. He retired, poor fella. I don't really remember much else about it, to be honest. Just a sore throat and a prescription. Nothing fancy. I mostly just try to stay healthy, you know? Lots of fish and walking.
DOCTOR: A couple of years… alright. And you said you generally feel healthy?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I get a little achy sometimes, you know, just getting older. And my knees aren't what they used to be, but that's just life, I guess. Nothing that keeps me from doing things, though. I still go fishing with Earl whenever I can, and I help out with the community garden. I try to stay busy, that's what keeps me going. No real complaints, honestly.
DOCTOR: "No real complaints" is good to hear, Ms. Fornes, but we still need to get a proper history. It’s… prudent. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Starting with your heart – do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, systems… that sounds complicated! Well, my heart feels fine, I think. No chest pain or anything like that. Sometimes I get a little winded when I’m walking uphill, but that’s probably just me being out of shape, not anything serious. And no palpitations… what are palpitations, actually? Does that mean like, when your heart races? I think I might’ve felt that once or twice after drinking a lot of coffee, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Palpitations are when you feel a fluttering or racing sensation in your chest, yes. It’s good you can distinguish between that and simply being out of breath. Now, what about your lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good to know. No, my lungs are fine, I think. I haven't been coughing much, and I can breathe okay. I used to smoke a little when I was younger, but I quit a long time ago. Maybe twenty years, or more. Earl helped me quit, he's a good man. I haven't had any trouble breathing since then. No wheezing or anything like that. I do get a little sniffly sometimes, especially in the spring with all the pollen, but that's just allergies, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Past smoking, but quit… that's positive. Let's move on. Any digestive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you're asking about my stomach? Well, I eat pretty normally, I guess. I like fish, like I said, and Earl makes a good stew. Sometimes I get a little heartburn, especially if I eat something spicy, but that’s just old age again, I think. And sometimes… well, sometimes I'm a little constipated, if I'm being honest. But nothing too terrible. I drink plenty of water, and Earl makes sure I get enough fiber in my diet. He's very good at looking after me.
DOCTOR: Constipation…right. Let’s try to stay focused, Ms. Fornes. We need a complete picture. Any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well, that’s a little personal, isn’t it? Well, I go to the bathroom when I need to, I guess. No trouble with that. No pain or anything like that. And I don't have to get up in the middle of the night or anything. Everything’s pretty regular, if you want to know. I drink a lot of water, like I said, so I think that helps. It's just… I don't usually talk about these things, even with Earl.
DOCTOR: I understand it's…personal, Ms. Fornes, but these questions are necessary. It’s part of a comprehensive exam. Now, let’s move on. Any joint pain, swelling, or stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my joints! That’s something. My knees, mostly. They ache sometimes, especially when it's cold or damp. And they get a little stiff in the mornings, so it takes me a while to get going. I try to stay active, but it’s hard sometimes. Earl rubs them with some liniment, and that helps a little. And I try not to overdo it. I used to be able to dance for hours, but not anymore. It's just… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Aches and stiffness, worse with cold… Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, my skin? Well, it’s getting a little wrinkly, of course. And I have a few age spots, especially on my hands and face. I used to spend a lot of time in the sun fishing with my dad when I was a kid. Didn't think much about sunscreen back then, silly me. No rashes or anything like that, though. Just…old lady skin, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not at all! I think I've actually gained a little weight, if anything. Earl makes such good food, it's hard to resist. No fever or night sweats either. I sleep pretty soundly, usually. Sometimes I have a little trouble getting to sleep, but that's just my mind racing, thinking about things. Nothing serious, I assure you. I feel pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Well, Dr. Peterson, he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, when I had that cold. But he said it wasn't anything to worry about, just watch my salt intake. I've been pretty good about that, Earl helps me with it. Other than that, no, I haven't been diagnosed with anything. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. No diabetes, no heart disease… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I had a bunion removed on my foot a long time ago. That was… oh, probably thirty years back? It didn’t hurt too bad, but it took a while to heal. Other than that, no. No major surgeries. Just the tonsils and the bunion.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… Well, my mother, she had heart trouble when she got older. She had to have a pacemaker put in. And my grandfather, on my husband Earl’s side, he had diabetes. That’s about all I can think of right now. No cancer, as far as I know. Everyone else, they just… lived to be old. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not at all! I haven’t smoked in over twenty years, like I said. And I don’t drink alcohol, never have. And drugs? Heavens no! I’m a good Tlingit woman, I don’t partake in those things. I drink tea, that’s it. Earl and I, we just live a quiet life. Fishing, gardening… it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Well, I take a little aspirin sometimes for my knees, when they’re really aching. And I take a multivitamin, just to keep healthy. And Earl makes me a special tea with herbs from the garden, he says it’s good for my joints. Other than that, no. No prescription medications. Just the aspirin, the multivitamin, and Earl’s special tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Fornes, based on what you've told me, and given your age and general health status, I recommend a basic blood work panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. And I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good, Dr. Fourney. I trust your judgment. No, I don’t have any allergies to medications that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before. I can always tell Earl if I start feeling funny, though. He knows me better than anyone. He’ll let you know right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get started. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please remove your shirt and bra.
PATIENT: Oh… Oh, goodness. Remove my… really? Is that necessary? It’s just a check-up, isn’t it? Can’t you listen through my shirt? I don’t usually… well, I’m just not very comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, it’s a standard procedure. To accurately assess your heart and lung sounds, I need to listen directly to your chest. It is medically necessary, not a matter of comfort. If you prefer, a nurse can be present. But frankly, I haven't got all day.
PATIENT: Oh… Well… if you have to… I suppose it’s alright. But please be quick, Dr. Fourney. And… and please be gentle. I just don’t like being… exposed like that. I’m an old woman, you know. And… maybe just a quick look, if you don’t mind? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please change into this gown. I’ll step out and give you a moment of privacy. And Ms. Fornes, please try to relax. It’s a simple examination.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I don't like this one bit… Earl is going to hear about this…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes, if you're ready. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your heart. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Respiratory effort appears normal… Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are diminished at the bases. No wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 142/88. Elevated.
PATIENT: Oh… is that bad? My blood pressure, is it too high? I've been trying to watch my salt, like Dr. Peterson said. And the breathing… diminished, you said? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my lungs? I don't feel sick…
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Ms. Fornes. It warrants attention. And “diminished breath sounds” simply means your lungs aren’t expanding fully. It could be due to a number of factors – age, decreased muscle tone, even being slightly overweight. It’s not necessarily a cause for panic, but it requires further investigation. I’m going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues, and a repeat blood work panel to assess your cholesterol and kidney function. We also need to discuss lifestyle modifications to manage your blood pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray? Is that… is that safe? I’ve heard things about radiation… and lifestyle modifications… what does that mean? Do I have to go on a diet? I like Earl’s cooking so much… This is all very overwhelming, Dr. Fourney. I just came in for a routine check-up, and now I need X-rays and blood work and… modifications. Can you explain it to me a little slower? And maybe tell me why I need all of these things?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, the radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal – far less than you receive from a cross-country flight. It’s a necessary diagnostic tool. As for “lifestyle modifications,” it simply means making some small changes to improve your health. Reducing your salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular exercise. It doesn’t necessarily mean a strict diet, though losing a few pounds wouldn’t hurt. The reason we’re doing all of this is to ensure your long-term health and prevent more serious complications down the line. Your elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds are red flags that we need to address proactively. We’re not trying to deprive you of Earl’s cooking, Ms. Fornes, just encouraging you to make healthier choices. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. So, it’s not a bad thing, just… something I need to pay attention to? And the X-ray won’t hurt me? And I can still have Earl's stew sometimes? Well, that’s good. But… where do I go for the X-ray? And how do I schedule the blood work? And… is there anything else I need to do? I always forget things, you know. Maybe I should bring Earl with me next time, he’s very good at remembering details. He'd probably ask all the right questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. I'm writing you a referral for a chest X-ray at Suburban Imaging Center. They're just down the street. The number is on the referral. As for the blood work, you can schedule an appointment at the lab inside the clinic. The front desk can assist you. And yes, you can still have Earl's stew… in moderation. I'm also going to prescribe a low-sodium diet guide. It outlines healthy eating habits and provides recipes. As for bringing Earl next time, that's perfectly acceptable. But please try to remember the key points we discussed today. Do you have any further questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Dr. Fourney. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all for now. I’ll try to remember everything, and I’ll definitely bring Earl with me next time. He’ll be glad to hear we can still have stew. And thank you for being patient with me. I just get so flustered sometimes. Well, thank you again, Dr. Fourney. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll go schedule the tests now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the front desk know if you have any difficulties scheduling. And remember, moderation in all things, Ms. Fornes.
