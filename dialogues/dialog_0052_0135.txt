DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Pleasure is mine. I am Gerhard Radillo. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, yes? It started maybe three days ago. Not much at first, but now… more.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Radillo. A discharge from your ear, starting three days ago and increasing since then. I understand. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… not blood. It is… a little thick. And… yellowish. Not much smell, but… not clear, you understand? Like… not water. And sometimes… a little bit of pain. Not very bad, just… a feeling. Like pressure, maybe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A yellowish, slightly thick discharge with no significant odor, and some pressure or discomfort in your ear. Alright. Has there been any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… no dizziness. Not that I notice. Hearing… maybe a little quiet? But I am old, Doctor. My ears not so good anyway. No ringing, no. Just… quiet sometimes. It could be the house, yes? My wife… she liked the television very loud.
DOCTOR: I see. So, potentially some mild hearing reduction, but nothing you've definitively noticed as new or directly related to the ear issue. And it hasn’t been accompanied by ringing. Thank you for clarifying that. Have you had any recent fever, cough, or cold symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No cough. No cold. Weather is warm, yes? I feel… healthy otherwise. This ear is just… a bother. I have no energy for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. You're feeling generally well, no systemic symptoms like fever or cough, and this ear discharge is your primary concern. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes placed as a child, or any ear surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. Let me think. As a boy, yes. When I was… maybe eight? I had many earaches. The doctor… he put something in my ears. Tubes, I think? Small things. And then… nothing for many years. No surgery. Just the tubes, when I was young.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, a history of ear tubes as a child, but nothing significant since then. Do you currently wear any hearing aids, and have you experienced any recent trauma to your ear, like a blow to the head or putting anything in your ear, even a cotton swab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No hearing aids. And no… no hitting the ear. And I do not put things in my ear. My wife, she always said it was a bad idea. Cotton swabs… no. I listen to the radio sometimes, but only with headphones. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Please. I want to fix this ear. It is… annoying. Go ahead. I will be still.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I'm going to use this instrument to look inside your ear canal. It doesn’t go in very far. I’m just going to visualize the ear drum and the canal itself. Okay… I'm seeing some cerumen, or earwax, present in both ears, but more prominent in the right ear. The ear canal appears slightly inflamed, and I can see a small amount of yellowish discharge. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, is slightly dull and appears to be retracted, meaning it’s not as prominent as it should be. I don’t see any immediate signs of a perforated eardrum, but the inflammation is concerning. Based on what I’m seeing, it appears you have otitis externa, an outer ear infection, potentially with a secondary buildup of cerumen. The discharge and inflammation are consistent with that diagnosis. However, to confirm this and rule out any middle ear involvement, I’d like to collect a sample of the discharge for a culture. This will help identify the specific bacteria causing the infection and ensure we prescribe the most effective antibiotic. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A culture, yes? To find the… bacteria? And then the medicine? It is good to know what it is. Yes. Please. Do what you need. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Radillo. I appreciate your trust. I’m going to use a small, sterile swab to gently collect a sample of the discharge from your ear canal. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, that’s done. It will take a few days to get the results back from the lab. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops to help fight the infection. I’m also going to recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if you’re experiencing any discomfort. I’m prescribing Ciprofloxacin otic solution, 10 drops twice a day for 7 days. And I’ll also give you a written prescription for the pain reliever. It's very important to keep your ear dry during this time – avoid swimming, showering, or getting water in your ear. You can use a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly to protect it if you need to shower. And avoid cleaning your ear with cotton swabs. They can worsen the infection and push the bacteria deeper into the ear canal. Do you have any questions about the medication or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… clear. Ciprofloxacin, twice a day. Seven days. Keep it dry. No cotton swabs. Petroleum jelly… to keep water out. Very good. No questions. Just… when will I feel better?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, you’ve remembered everything perfectly. As for when you'll feel better, most patients start to experience some improvement within 2 to 3 days of starting the antibiotic ear drops. However, it's important to complete the entire 7-day course, even if your symptoms improve sooner, to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, severe pain, or drainage from your ear that is bloody or foul-smelling, please contact the office immediately. I’d like to see you back in one week to re-evaluate and ensure the infection is resolving. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. One week. I will come back. And I will remember everything you said. No cotton swabs. Complete the medicine. If worse, come back. Thank you. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. I’ve also printed out detailed aftercare instructions, including the medication list and signs to watch for. Here you are. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you again. You have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Radillo. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if anything changes or if you have any questions.
