DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Gorga. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, you understand? But it’s… a squeezing. Like someone is holding it tight. It started a few days ago, maybe four? It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing… four days. Right. And where exactly in your chest are you feeling this, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. More in the middle, not so much on the sides. And sometimes… it goes up to my jaw a little bit. Not bad, just… feels tight there too when the chest hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, center of the chest, radiating to the jaw. And does anything bring on this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't know if anything makes it happen, exactly. But it feels worse when I walk fast. Or… when I carry groceries. Anything that makes me breathe a little harder, I think. Just a little harder. Not like running a race, just… normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, exertion seems to be a trigger. Have you noticed if it goes away when you rest?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, it does. When I sit down and relax, it gets much better. Sometimes it goes away completely. And if I just… take it easy for a bit, it doesn’t bother me for a while. It’s not constant, you see? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Do you have any shortness of breath along with the chest pain, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. I don't feel like I can’t breathe, no. Just… sometimes I feel a little… winded, maybe? Like I've done too much. But not like… panicky or anything. Just a little tired when I’ve been walking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Now, have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had a little heartburn sometimes, you know? But this feels… different. This is a squeezing, like I said. Heartburn is more of a burning, right? This isn’t burning. It’s just… tight. And it worries me because my uncle… he had a bad heart. A very bad heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems. That's important. Let's quickly go through some other things. Any nausea, sweating, or dizziness when this pain occurs?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. And I haven’t been sweating, no. Not extra, anyway. It’s warm here, you know? But not like… a cold sweat or anything. And no dizziness, no. I feel… normal, except for the chest pain. Just worried, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Chelberg, to get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course! Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what's going on, you see? I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, please have a seat here. Just a quick listen and a few checks, and then we'll talk about what we find.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is regular, but a bit fast, 88. Heart sounds… I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs are clear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine, you see. Just a little something for a cold sometimes. Nothing special. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just vitamins, sometimes. A little vitamin D, because the doctor said I was a little low last year. But that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital… oh, except when I had my babies. A long, long time ago! But that was… many years ago. Everything was fine then. A normal delivery, both times.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, just a quick family history question… Besides your uncle with heart problems, is there anyone else in your family with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had high blood pressure when she was older. And my brother, he has diabetes. He has to take pills for it. But that's it, I think. Everyone else was pretty healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright Ms. Chelberg, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The fact that it’s brought on by exertion and relieved by rest is consistent with that. The family history also raises some concern. However, we need to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture. I’m going to order an EKG – that’s a simple test to check your heart’s electrical activity. I also want to order some blood tests, including one to check for cardiac enzymes, which can indicate heart damage. And, given your history, I'd like to refer you to a cardiologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious. Angina… a cardiologist… Well, if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. Yes, of course. I trust your judgment. What do I need to do? For the tests, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No need to worry just yet. These are just precautionary steps. The EKG is quick and painless; we can do it right here in the office. I’ll give you a lab order for the blood tests; you can go to [Name of local lab] any time that’s convenient for you. As for the cardiologist, I'll have my nurse prepare a referral for Dr. Ramirez; she’s excellent. She’ll call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, and if you experience any chest pain that doesn't go away with rest, or if it gets worse, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No strenuous activity… and go to the emergency room if it doesn’t go away. Okay. Dr. Ramirez… I’ll write that down. It’s just… it worries me, you see? My uncle… he waited too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. And it's good that you're taking this seriously. Waiting is never a good idea when it comes to your heart. We’re going to get this checked out, and then we'll have a clear plan. I’ll also have the nurse give you some information about angina and what to expect. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… thank you. For taking the time. And for listening. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. That's what I’m here for. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and information. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take it easy. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
