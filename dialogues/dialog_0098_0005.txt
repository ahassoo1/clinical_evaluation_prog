DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bombara. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here today to get myself cleared for a new place to live. A senior living facility, you see. They require a check-up first, to make sure I am… suitable. I believe that is the word they used.
DOCTOR: Suitable, yes, I understand. A good precaution on their part, certainly. It’s wonderful you’re considering a senior living facility. We’ll get you cleared as best we can. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, at my age, things aren't quite as they used to be, naturally. But I’ve been fortunate. I’ve always kept busy, and I believe that helps. I’m a baker, have been my whole life. Still am, actually, though not as much as I once did. My hands… they ache sometimes. And my knees, too, especially when the weather changes. Otherwise, I feel… sound. I eat well, mostly. My daughter helps with that now, makes sure I get enough fruits and vegetables. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. Is that the sort of thing you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. It's good to hear you stay active and eat well. And no smoking or alcohol, that’s excellent. The aches in your hands and knees… how long have you been experiencing those, and would you say they’re constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, the aches… well, the hands have been troublesome for maybe ten years now, getting worse gradually. It’s the kneading, you see. All that work. They’re usually there, a dull ache, but flare up when I bake a lot. The knees… those are newer. Maybe five years, started with the cold weather, and they certainly let me know when a storm is coming! They come and go, mostly with the weather, but sometimes they bother me even on nice days. It doesn’t keep me from doing things, mind you, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the hand and knee aches, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course, that's why I have these glasses. But that’s just age. And sometimes I feel a little… forgetful, though my daughter says that’s normal too. But I remember things just fine, usually. Dates, names… important things. I don’t think I’ve been dizzy or short of breath, or had any chest pain. No unusual tiredness, either. I sleep well enough, though I wake up earlier these days. Is there anything specific you're looking for? Perhaps I’m not explaining myself well.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly well, Mr. Tkac. It's helpful to have that information. A little forgetfulness is common with age, as you said. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, now, that's a good question. Let me see… I had a touch of pneumonia when I was a young man, but I recovered fully. And my mother had high blood pressure, I believe, but I don't believe I've ever been diagnosed with it myself. The doctor checked me regularly for years, always said my heart was strong. I’ve never had diabetes, no. I’ve always been careful with sweets, ironic for a baker, perhaps! I did break my arm once, when I was a boy, but that healed up nicely. I think that's all. I’ve been fortunate, truly. I’ve always tried to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think carefully… Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. Years ago, when I was in my thirties, I had my appendix taken out. It was quite a thing at the time, but it went well. And… Oh, and I had a cataract removed from my right eye about fifteen years ago. That improved my vision quite a bit! Aside from those two, no. Nothing else. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid needing surgery. It worries my daughter, though. She says I should be more careful!
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. A small pill for my water. My daughter reminds me every morning. It helps with… well, with holding it, you see. Keeps things regular. It’s a very small dose, nothing much at all. It doesn’t bother me any. And that’s it. Just that one little pill. I don’t like taking a lot of medication, if I can avoid it. It always makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, never had a reaction. My daughter tried to get me to avoid shellfish once, just to be safe, but I insisted on trying a bit, and I was fine. I've never had a problem with bee stings or poison ivy, either. Nothing. I seem to be able to eat and touch just about anything without trouble. I suppose I'm just a hardy sort.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Tkac, to get a better picture of your overall health, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won’t take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Go right ahead. I have nothing to hide! I've always taken care of myself, as I’ve mentioned. I'm happy to let you listen and look. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up here for me. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, but that's not uncommon at your age. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Ears look clear. A little wax buildup, but nothing significant. Throat looks clear. No redness or swelling. Everything seems within normal limits for your age. I'd like to check your reflexes and range of motion. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I haven’t had my reflexes checked in quite some time, but I’m sure I can manage. I used to be very active, you see, always moving and lifting. I still try to stay as nimble as possible. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for someone your age. Grip strength is good, a little weaker on the left side, but not concerning. Range of motion is a little limited in your shoulders and knees, but you're able to move them through a full range. Some stiffness, as expected. Overall, everything seems consistent with age-related changes. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to order some routine blood work. Just a basic panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'd rather be thorough than regret something later. My daughter always says the same thing, you know. “Better safe than sorry,” she tells me. I suppose she’s right. So yes, go ahead and order the blood work. When would I need to go get that done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's a form for the lab. You can go any time tomorrow, or whenever it's convenient for you. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have those, we can discuss them and determine if any further testing is needed. In the meantime, based on what we've discussed today and the physical exam, you appear to be in generally good health for your age. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor, but it's not drastically high. As for being cleared for the senior living facility, I don't see any immediate medical reasons why you wouldn't be suitable. However, I would like to review the blood work results before giving you a definitive clearance. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’d feel better knowing everything is as it should be before making any changes. And I understand waiting for the blood work results. It’s better to be sure, as you say. So, in the meantime, I can go ahead and… start the paperwork with the facility? I suppose they'll want a form from you eventually? And I should schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the results? I don’t want to be a bother, of course.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Tkac. That’s what I'm here for. Yes, they will likely need a medical clearance form completed by a physician. I can certainly fill that out for you once I have the blood work results. And yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, just to discuss the results and finalize the clearance. Does next week, say, Tuesday at 10 AM work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10 AM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you very much. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and your patience with an old man like myself. I’ll go get the blood work done tomorrow. Is there anything else I should do before then? Or anything I should be aware of? Perhaps avoid certain foods? Just let me know.
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just eat and drink as you normally would. There's no need to change anything for the blood work. Here’s a copy of my notes for your records. And here’s the lab requisition form again, just in case. I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Bombara. You as well. And I will certainly call if anything arises. You’ve been very helpful. .
