DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I haven’t got all day. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, and it’s getting worse. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. Can we just… get on with it? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your time is valuable, and we will get right to it. This shaking you mention – can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… moves. My hand moves when I don’t want it to. Especially when I’m trying to do something precise, like… holding a fork. Or signing my name. It’s just… annoying! Look, it's like a little tremor, alright? It’s not like I’m doing the jitterbug or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tremor, especially noticeable with fine motor skills like eating or writing. And it's been gradually worsening, you said?
PATIENT: Gradually? Yes, I suppose. It started… well, honestly, I don’t really remember when it started. A while ago, like I said. Probably after… Martha passed. Everything gets fuzzy after a certain point, you know? Old age, I guess. Don't need a doctor to tell me that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. Losing Martha must have been incredibly difficult. And it’s common for things to feel less clear with time. So, the tremor seems to have become more noticeable after Martha's passing. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go? Hmph. It’s… mostly there. Sometimes it’s worse than others, I guess. Like if I'm tired, or… stressed. Though what’s left to stress about at my age? It's just… frustrating. It makes everything harder. I used to have such a steady hand, you know? Directed some big pictures, I did. A shame, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's generally present, but fluctuates in intensity, worsened by fatigue or stress. You mentioned directing pictures – that suggests you’ve had a very active life requiring a great deal of precision. Has the tremor affected your ability to do things you enjoy, aside from eating and writing?
PATIENT: Enjoy? What do I enjoy now? Martha’s gone. The business is… well, let’s just say the young ones don't care about my “vision” anymore. But yes, it makes holding a glass difficult. Pouring a drink… used to be so simple. Now it’s a whole production. And… forget about trying to play cards. It's a mess, an absolute mess.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds as though this tremor is impacting several aspects of your life, and it’s understandably frustrating. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I'm eighty years old! What doesn’t ache? I get tired easily, I forget things, my knees creak… is that what you want to know? Honestly, Doc, I'm not a spring chicken anymore. Everything’s falling apart. Just fix the shaking, alright? That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Baide, and you are right to focus on what’s most concerning to you. I simply ask to rule out anything else that could be contributing to the tremor. But let's focus on the shaking for now. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Sometimes. Mostly in the mornings. It takes a while to… loosen up, you know? Feels like I’ve got iron in my joints. But it goes away after I move around a bit. It’s just… old age, alright? I've already told you. I'm not expecting miracles here, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright, some morning stiffness that improves with movement. Thank you. And have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance? Well, I don't fall over every five minutes, if that's what you're asking. But I'm… more cautious now. I don’t go climbing ladders anymore, that's for sure. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little unsteady. Like I'm floating. But who doesn't at my age? Honestly, Doc, you’re going to give me a headache with all these questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions are becoming tiresome, Mr. Baide. I am just trying to gather as much information as possible. One last question, and then we can move on to a quick physical examination if you're agreeable. Have you noticed any changes in your speech, like slurring or a softer voice?
PATIENT: Look, are you suggesting I'm losing my mind and my ability to talk? Honestly! No, my speech is fine! Perfectly fine. People still understand me, alright? Maybe they pretend to, because they're being polite, but that’s their problem. Now, can we just… get this over with? I’ve got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I apologize if my questions seemed intrusive. It’s simply my responsibility to explore all possibilities. Very well, let’s move on to a quick physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up, alright? I haven't got all day. And don’t poke me too much. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse… Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
