DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my vision. It’s just not what it used to be. Frankly, I’m surprised it’s taken me this long to come in. I suppose I hoped it would correct itself. It hasn’t, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. Vision changes. And how long have you been noticing this decline?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It’s been gradual, you see. Months, certainly. Perhaps even a year or more. I don’t pay much attention to those sorts of things unless they become… inconvenient. It’s mostly a blurring, I suppose. And things don’t seem as… bright as they once were. Though, that could just be getting older.
DOCTOR: “Mostly a blurring.” Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… more consistent now. Initially, it would be worse at the end of the day, after a long stretch of reading reports. You know, the usual office work. But now… it's there pretty much all the time. Not debilitating, mind you. Just… noticeable. It makes reading small print particularly difficult. And I do enjoy a good book. A physical book, not one of those… electronic things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this blurring in one eye, both eyes, or does it seem to shift?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. Honestly, I haven't paid that close of attention. I suppose it feels… equal in both. It’s not like one eye is significantly worse than the other. Though, I really haven't tried to compare them. I just notice it when I'm trying to read something, and it's… frustrating. I had always prided myself on my sharp eyesight. My grandfather, he was a tracker, you know, with the Nation. Good eyes are important in that line of work. It's… disappointing to see it fade.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to get a better sense of where the problem lies. Let’s start with a basic visual acuity test. Can you follow my pen as I move it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though I must say, I’ve always suspected my vision was perfectly adequate. I’ve never needed glasses before, you know. Perhaps this is just a temporary thing. A little strain. I do spend a good deal of time reviewing employee files. A lot of small print, unfortunately. But, yes, I can follow your pen. Lead on.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to ask you to read the letters on this chart, starting with the largest. Please cover your left eye with your hand. And try to read the letters as clearly as you can. Don't strain, just tell me what you see. We'll start with this top row.
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s see… is that an ‘E’? Yes, I can see the ‘E’. A very large ‘E’, I might add. Are we going to get any smaller now? This seems rather… rudimentary. I’m quite certain I can see letters on that chart. It’s not the letters themselves that are the problem, it’s making sense of them. A blurry haze, if you will.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll proceed to smaller letters. We need to establish a baseline. Now, please read the next line, as best you can. Don't worry if you have difficulty. Just tell me what you think you see.
PATIENT: Hmm. That one is… difficult. Is that a… an ‘H’? No, wait. Perhaps a ‘P’? It’s terribly indistinct. Honestly, Doctor, this is hardly a scientific endeavor. I can see something is there, but deciphering it is proving… challenging. Is the room adequately lit? Perhaps a different chart would be more… revealing?
DOCTOR: The room is adequately lit. It’s standard procedure to start with this chart. Please attempt to read the letters to the best of your ability. If you are unsure, simply say so. What do you see on this line?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… that’s just a mess, Doctor. I can make out something resembling letters, but I couldn’t possibly be certain. Is that an ‘F’? Or a ‘V’? It’s all quite… ambiguous. I suppose I’m admitting defeat on that line. It’s… frustrating to lose one’s acuity. A shame, really. Perhaps it’s stress? I’ve been dealing with a rather difficult HR issue lately. Employees, honestly…
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… helpful. Now, let’s switch eyes. Cover your right eye this time. And again, tell me what you see on this line, starting with the largest letters. We’ll repeat the process.
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s see if the other eye fares any better. Yes, I can see the ‘E’. A rather large ‘E’, as before. It seems my left eye is… marginally better than the right, perhaps? Though, honestly, I wouldn’t put much stock in that observation. It’s all rather subjective, isn’t it? A blurry world, regardless. Proceed, Doctor. Let's get this over with. I have paperwork awaiting my attention. A mountain of it, I assure you. Employees… always with the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with the smaller letters. Focus on the first line and tell me what you can discern. Don’t strain, just tell me what you think you see.
PATIENT: This is… exceedingly difficult. It appears… vaguely like a ‘D’? Or perhaps a ‘P’ rotated slightly? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to doubt the efficacy of this entire exercise. Perhaps a different test altogether? I read reports for a living, you know. Fine print is my specialty. This… this is just making my head ache. Is it possible this chart is simply… poorly printed?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this preliminary assessment, your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. It’s not a matter of chart quality. It's clear further investigation is needed. I need to perform a more comprehensive eye exam, including checking your intraocular pressure and dilating your pupils to examine the retina. Do you have any allergies to eye drops?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had any trouble with… potions or anything of that nature. Though, I haven’t intentionally exposed myself to many, if I'm honest. I tend to avoid unnecessary chemicals. But no, I don't believe I have any allergies to eye drops. Though, do be gentle. I have rather sensitive eyes. And I'd prefer to avoid any… prolonged distortion of my vision. I have deadlines, you see. Important deadlines.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We’ll proceed cautiously. I'm going to instill a drop in each eye to dilate your pupils. It will cause your vision to be blurry for several hours, particularly up close, and you may experience some light sensitivity. We'll need to wait approximately 20-30 minutes for the drops to take full effect before I can perform the retinal exam. It’s important to have someone drive you home afterwards, as it will be unsafe to operate a vehicle. Do you have someone who can accompany you?
PATIENT: Accompany me… No. Unfortunately not. I am… not particularly close to anyone these days. Divorced, you see. And my extended family… well, let’s just say we don’t maintain regular contact. So, that presents a… complication. I suppose I could call a taxi, but I’m rather reluctant to trust a stranger with my transportation. Is there absolutely no way to avoid this dilation? Perhaps a less… intrusive method of examination? I have a rather busy schedule, Doctor. And frankly, the thought of being beholden to a taxi service… it’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, a dilated retinal exam is essential to rule out any serious underlying conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy. It is not simply a matter of convenience. Skipping this step could have significant consequences for your vision. Given your situation, and the fact that you cannot arrange transportation, I strongly advise against leaving the clinic without having a proper assessment. I cannot ethically discharge you without ensuring your eyes have been adequately examined. We can wait here for a while and see if you can reach a friend or family member. Alternatively, I can contact a local medical transport service for you, though there may be a cost involved. I understand your concerns, but your health is my priority.
PATIENT: Medical transport… a cost… This is… inconvenient, to say the least. A considerable inconvenience. I hadn’t anticipated this level of… disruption. Very well. Contact this… medical transport service. But I expect you to thoroughly vet them. I don’t want to be subjected to some… unreliable driver. And I’d like a clear estimate of the cost before they arrive. I am a man of… discerning taste, Doctor. And I do not appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll contact a reputable local service and obtain a cost estimate for you. It will likely take some time for them to arrive. In the meantime, I’ll review your medical history in more detail while we wait. Do you have any known allergies to medications in general?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t taken a great deal of medication in my life, thankfully. I prefer to maintain a… natural approach to health. A good diet, regular exercise… common sense, really. But no, I don’t have any known allergies. Though, I do have a rather sensitive stomach. Certain foods don’t agree with me. But that’s hardly relevant, is it? Just… try to avoid anything overly potent, if you must administer anything at all. And please, hurry with this transport arrangement. My schedule is becoming increasingly… compromised.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m contacting the transport service now. It may be a few minutes while I confirm their availability and estimated arrival time. While we wait, I’ll ask a few more questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… No. Never. I’ve always maintained a… remarkably stable constitution. My blood pressure is typically quite good, thank you very much. And diabetes? Absolutely not. I do enjoy a sweet treat from time to time, but I’m certainly not diabetic. I’ve always been quite careful with my diet, despite the occasional indulgence. I pride myself on my health, Doctor. Honestly, this entire situation is rather perplexing. To have my vision failing… it simply doesn’t make sense. But proceed, please. Let's get this over with. The sooner I have an answer, the better. And the sooner I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any eye surgeries or injuries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, never. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid the need for such… drastic measures. I’ve never had any eye surgery. And injuries… Well, I was a rather active child, you see. A bit of a tomboy, if I’m honest. But nothing serious. A few scrapes and bruises, perhaps. A black eye once, during a particularly enthusiastic game of… well, it doesn’t matter. Nothing that required medical attention. No, no surgeries or injuries to report. Just… a general carelessness of youth, I suppose. But nothing that would affect my vision now, surely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had cataracts, I believe. Removed surgically, many years ago. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he suffered from glaucoma, I think. Lost a good deal of his sight later in life. It’s… not a particularly robust lineage, if I’m honest. Prone to ailments, generally. That’s why I’ve always taken such good care of myself. Trying to buck the trend, you see. It seems my efforts may have been… insufficient, however. But yes, cataracts and glaucoma. Those are the only things that come to mind. A rather unfortunate combination, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not currently. I haven't needed anything prescription in years. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, given the lack of sunlight. But that's it. Nothing for blood pressure, cholesterol, or anything else. I try to maintain a natural lifestyle, you see. A good diet, regular exercise, and a healthy dose of skepticism towards modern medicine. Just the vitamin D, Doctor. That's all. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of indigestion last week. Took a little antacid. But that was a one-time thing. Nothing regular. Is that sufficient? Can we finally proceed with this examination?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Very well. Shoes and socks, you say? I trust this will be a swift process, Doctor. I have appointments awaiting my attention, you see. And frankly, I find undressing in a clinical setting… somewhat undignified. But proceed, please. Let’s get this over with. And try to be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Relax your arm, please. 140 over 90. A bit elevated. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast. No murmurs detected. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, but a little diminished. Now, I’m going to examine your eyes more closely with an ophthalmoscope. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: It's… rather bright, Doctor. A little uncomfortable, if I'm honest. Is everything alright? Is something amiss? I trust you're not detecting anything… alarming? My vision is precious to me, you see. I read extensively, you know. It’s a vital part of my life. Please, tell me everything is alright. Are you seeing anything unusual? Cataracts? Glaucoma? Anything at all? Don’t hesitate to inform me. Honesty is paramount, you know.
DOCTOR: I do see some early signs of cataracts in both eyes. They're not severe enough to require immediate surgery, but they are progressing. I also note some optic disc cupping, which could be indicative of early glaucoma. However, it's difficult to say definitively without further testing. Your peripheral vision appears intact at this time. We need to perform a visual field test and measure your intraocular pressure to confirm or rule out glaucoma. That's why I recommended dilating your pupils, as it allows for a more thorough examination. We’ll also need to monitor your cataracts closely with regular check-ups. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Cataracts… and glaucoma? This is… not what I expected. Not at all. My family history… it seems to be catching up with me. Monitoring… regular check-ups… it sounds… ominous. And the dilation… I still haven’t arranged transportation. What are the… implications? If it is glaucoma, what does that mean for my vision? Will I… go blind? And the cataracts… how quickly do they progress? Will I need surgery? Be frank with me, Doctor. I need to know the truth. No sugarcoating. What am I facing?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's address your concerns one at a time. Regarding glaucoma, it's a progressive optic neuropathy that can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. However, with early detection and proper management, we can slow or even halt the progression. Treatment typically involves eye drops to lower your intraocular pressure. Surgery is an option if drops are not effective. Regarding cataracts, the progression rate varies from person to person. Some cataracts develop slowly over many years, while others progress more rapidly. When they begin to significantly interfere with your daily activities, such as reading or driving, surgery is usually recommended. The surgery is generally very safe and effective, and can restore your vision. Right now, it's too early to say definitively if you have glaucoma or how quickly your cataracts are progressing. That's why the additional testing is so important. We need to establish a baseline and monitor your condition closely. And the dilation allows me to get a better look at the retina and optic nerve. I understand your anxiety, but we’ll face this step-by-step. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Step-by-step… The drops… would they have side effects? I’ve always been sensitive to medications. And the surgery… is it painful? And what about recovery time? I have obligations, you see. I can't simply disappear for weeks on end. And the cost… what will all of this cost? The testing, the drops, the surgery… I'm on a fixed income, you see. I need to be realistic. Be frank with me, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat anything. I need to know the financial implications as well. This is… overwhelming. Perhaps I should have just ignored it. Perhaps my vision would have simply faded away on its own. But no… I came in for a proper assessment. And now I'm facing… all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s address your concerns systematically. The glaucoma eye drops can have side effects, such as stinging, burning, redness, and blurred vision. However, most people tolerate them well. There are also different types of drops available, so if you experience side effects with one type, we can try another. Cataract surgery is generally minimally invasive and does not require a lengthy hospital stay. It’s typically performed on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day. Recovery time is usually relatively short, and most people can resume normal activities within a few days to a week. There may be some mild discomfort and blurred vision for a few days after surgery, but this can be managed with eye drops and pain medication. Regarding cost, the testing, drops, and surgery costs will vary depending on your insurance coverage and the specific procedures performed. I'll have my billing department contact you to provide a detailed estimate. However, given that you are uninsured, I can refer you to a local charitable organization that provides financial assistance for vision care. I’ll also explore options for lower-cost medications and surgery facilities. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll work together to develop a plan that is both effective and affordable. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you may have along the way. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Charitable organizations… I'm… not particularly fond of relying on charity. It feels… undignified. But I suppose I have little choice, given my circumstances. Very well. Contact this… charitable organization. And explore options for lower-cost medications and surgery facilities. I trust you'll do your due diligence. And what about the dilation? Have you arranged transportation yet? I'm still waiting for a ride. I can't simply sit here indefinitely. My schedule is… rather demanding, you see. Perhaps I should have just ignored it. Perhaps my vision would have simply faded away on its own. But no… I came in for a proper assessment. And now I'm facing… all of this.
DOCTOR: I'm still working on arranging transportation. It's proving to be… challenging, given the current circumstances. I've contacted several local services, but availability is limited. I anticipate it will be at least another 30-45 minutes before a ride arrives. In the meantime, I'll review your medical history in more detail and prepare the necessary paperwork for the testing and potential referrals. I'll also contact the billing department and the charitable organization to expedite the process. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. I assure you I'm doing everything I can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. Perhaps you’d like a magazine to pass the time?
PATIENT: Magazines… No, thank you. I find them… intellectually stimulating. I’d rather simply sit in silence and contemplate my impending vision loss. Contemplate my impending vision loss… and the financial ruin that awaits me. Perhaps I should have just ignored it. Perhaps my vision would have simply faded away on its own. But no… I came in for a proper assessment. And now I'm facing… all of this. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll let you rest. I’ll inform you as soon as transportation arrives. .
