DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's Cleo. Yeah, well... it's about, um… long-term care. My wife… she took care of all that stuff. And she’s… gone now. So, I guess I need to figure out what she had, you know? For… later on. If I need it. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Long-term care planning… difficult even with someone handling it. And I understand it’s especially challenging now. So, you’re hoping to understand what arrangements your wife had in place, potentially for your own future use?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. She always seemed to have things… sorted. Insurance and… stuff. I don’t even know where to start looking for papers, to be honest. She had a little office in the spare room, but… everything looks the same to me now. Just piles of things. She was a real organized person, though. Always was. I just want to be prepared, you know? If I need help someday.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s start with what you know. Do you recall the name of her insurance provider?
PATIENT: Insurance… hmm. Let me think… It was… a big name, I think. Not a local one. She always said it was a good company… It started with a… “P”? Or maybe an “A”? Oh, this is no good. I really wish I paid more attention. She handled everything. I’m sorry, I just can't seem to pull it out of my head. It’s all… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to apologize, Mr. Rover. It’s perfectly understandable. We can try another approach. Do you happen to recall if she had a dedicated long-term care insurance policy, or was it part of a broader health insurance plan?
PATIENT: Um… I think… a separate one? She always talked about long-term care specifically. Like, for if I needed… a home or something. Not just the regular doctor stuff. But, honestly, she used a lot of words I didn't understand. She’d explain it, and I’d nod… but it never really stuck. Was there a card? She always had cards for everything. I just… haven’t seen it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s see if we can pull up any records associated with your name and date of birth in our system. Sometimes insurance information is linked to patient files. It’s a long shot, but worth a try. Do you mind if I check?
PATIENT: No, no, please do. That would be… wonderful, if you could. I really appreciate you trying. I just… feel so lost without her. She always knew what to do. Anything would help, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, I do see a record here indicating you have a long-term care insurance policy through Pacific Life. It appears to be a hybrid policy, combining life insurance with a long-term care rider. The policy number is… 478-B92-Lambda. It lists your wife, Elara Rover, as the previous point of contact. Do you recognize that?
PATIENT: Pacific Life… yes! That rings a bell. Pacific Life… she definitely mentioned that name. And… Elara… that’s my wife. Yes! Oh, thank goodness. You found it! That's… a huge relief. A hybrid policy… what does that mean, exactly? Is that a good thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good news. A hybrid policy means the policy provides both a death benefit – a payout to your beneficiaries upon your passing – and a long-term care benefit. If you require long-term care services – like a nursing home, assisted living, or in-home care – the policy will cover those costs, up to a certain amount. It’s generally considered a good option because you’re not losing the value of the policy if you don't end up needing long-term care. The details of the coverage amount and terms are here… it appears you have a daily benefit of $250, with a maximum lifetime benefit of $375,000.
PATIENT: $250 a day… and $375,000 total? That’s… a lot of numbers. What does $250 a day even cover? Like, does that pay for everything at a home? Or just… part of it? And what does “terms” mean? I’m sorry, I'm probably asking silly questions. She always explained everything so clearly, and I just… wasn't listening close enough.
DOCTOR: No, those aren't silly questions at all, Mr. Rover. It is a lot of information. Let me break it down. $250 a day is the maximum amount the policy will pay per day for covered long-term care services. That could include room and board at a nursing home or assisted living facility, or hourly care costs for in-home assistance. However, it doesn't necessarily cover all costs. Depending on the facility or service, there may be additional expenses not covered by the policy. “Terms” refers to the specific conditions of the policy - things like waiting periods, benefit limitations, and eligible services. For example, there's typically a waiting period before benefits kick in, and certain types of care might not be covered. To give you a clearer picture, I recommend contacting Pacific Life directly to get a detailed explanation of your policy and its benefits. I can give you their customer service number if you’d like.
PATIENT: Yes, please. The number would be great. I just… feel better knowing where to start. Maybe if I talk to them, I can actually understand what she set up. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. It’s just… hard, you know? Losing her… and then having to figure all this stuff out. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. I understand. It's a difficult situation, and you're doing the best you can. The number for Pacific Life customer service is 1-800-541-5555. They can walk you through all the specifics of your policy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
