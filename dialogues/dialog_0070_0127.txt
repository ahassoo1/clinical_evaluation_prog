DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been getting weaker, progressively, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's making it difficult to keep them open, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness and drooping eyelids, progressively worsening over several months – that certainly warrants investigation. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started… I think around February, maybe? It was just a little bit of trouble lifting things, nothing major. I work in facilities management, so I’m on my feet a lot, doing bits and pieces. But it’s gotten… harder. Now, even just walking up the stairs is a bit of an effort. It feels like my muscles… just give out easier, if that makes sense. And it's not really painful, just… tiring. A lot tiring.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, it began around February, gradual onset, affecting your ability to do everyday tasks at work and now even climbing stairs is becoming difficult. You describe it as tiring, not painful. Does this weakness feel more pronounced at certain times of the day, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think it is worse towards the end of the day. In the mornings, I feel… almost normal. But by the afternoon, it's noticeably harder to do things. And like you said, it’s definitely gotten worse over the months, even within a single day. It's strange. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s just… steadily building. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Schaust. You're explaining it very well. Weakness that is worse later in the day and has been progressively increasing is important information. Now, regarding the drooping eyelids – has this been happening on one side more than the other, or is it symmetrical?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly on my right side, I think. It's hard to tell for sure, because I don't really look at my face all that closely, but my right eyelid definitely seems to droop more than my left. It’s become noticeable enough that people at work have asked me if I’m tired. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. And it feels… heavy, sometimes. Like I have to consciously keep it open.
DOCTOR: I understand. Asymmetry is important. Drooping on one side, worsening over time, and feeling heavy… all helpful pieces. Have you noticed any double vision or blurred vision at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes, especially in the evenings, things seem a little… blurry. Not all the time, and it's not severe, but I have noticed it. I just thought it was because I was tired, or the lighting wasn’t very good. It hasn’t been bad enough to worry about, but it’s there. Does that… does that sound significant? I really don't know much about any of this.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Schaust. The blurry vision, in combination with the weakness and drooping eyelid, is something we need to investigate further. Have you experienced any other symptoms at all – perhaps changes in your voice, difficulty swallowing, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, not really. My voice feels… normal, I think. And no trouble swallowing. My weight… I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. I’ve been a bit stressed with everything, so my eating habits haven’t been the best. But I haven't noticed any significant weight loss, no. Just… tired. Very, very tired. And a little worried, now.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good you’re bringing all this to our attention. Okay, Mr. Schaust, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll check your strength, reflexes, and cranial nerves – that includes looking closely at your eyes and muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’d like to figure out what’s going on, if possible. Please, go ahead. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, please relax. I'm going to have you follow my finger with your eyes. Just keep looking at it, don't strain. And then I'll test your strength... could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go, I think. Is that alright? It feels… a little difficult, actually. Not painful, just… a bit harder than usual.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. And now the other hand, please. Okay. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please rest your arms comfortably. And finally, I'd like to examine your eyes a bit more closely. Okay, Mr. Schaust. That’s all for the physical exam. I've noted some weakness in your hands, slightly diminished reflexes, and the ptosis in your right eyelid, with some limitation in your eye movements. Now, based on your symptoms and the examination findings, I am concerned about the possibility of a neuromuscular disorder. Specifically, given the progressive weakness, ptosis, and fatigue, we need to consider conditions like Myasthenia Gravis. However, further testing is essential to confirm this. Would you be willing to proceed with some blood tests and possibly an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? That sounds… serious. I’ve never heard of it. But yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary to figure out what’s going on, I’m willing to do. Blood tests and an MRI… yes, please. I just want to know what’s happening to me. And hopefully… hopefully, it’s something that can be treated. Is it… is it something that could get worse quickly? I'm getting a little anxious now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust. It’s natural to be concerned when facing uncertainty. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It can progress, but the rate of progression varies significantly from person to person. Fortunately, it is often treatable with medications or other therapies. To begin, I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a specific antibody test for Myasthenia Gravis—specifically, the acetylcholine receptor antibody. We will also order an MRI of your brain to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. I’ll also schedule you for a consultation with a neurologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance, who specializes in neuromuscular disorders. She can perform more specialized testing, such as an electromyography , to assess your muscle function in greater detail. Would you be comfortable with me scheduling that appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… incredibly helpful. Scheduling the appointment would be fantastic. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, Doctor. And thank you for ordering the tests. Hopefully, we can get some answers soon. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, anything I should avoid, or… any particular symptoms I should watch out for that would warrant a call to the clinic?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activities that exacerbate your weakness. Rest is important. Pay close attention to any new or worsening symptoms, particularly: Difficulty breathing or swallowing: This is the most concerning symptom and requires immediate medical attention. Double vision: If it worsens significantly or becomes constant. Slurred speech: Any new difficulty speaking clearly. If you experience any of these symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, keep a log of your symptoms – what makes them worse, what makes them better – that will be helpful when we discuss the results of the tests. I've scheduled your neurology appointment for August 16th at 2:00 PM. You’ll receive a confirmation email shortly. The lab results should be available within 3-5 business days, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. August 16th… good. I'll definitely keep a log of my symptoms, and I'll be sure to watch out for those things you mentioned. Thank you again, Doctor Abady. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what we’re looking at.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your neurology appointment. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
