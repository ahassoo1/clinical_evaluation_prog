DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. It’s been a little while now, I think. Not so bad I couldn’t work, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable sinuses. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It feels… full. Like pressure, behind my nose and in my cheeks. And… sometimes it hurts a little when I bend over. It's hard to explain. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Maybe a few weeks? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, pressure and fullness, worse when bending over… alright. Do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I feel tired. More tired than usual, maybe. And… I think my nose feels a little stuffy? Not always, though. It’s not like a bad cold, you understand. Just… something is not right. I don't know if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. So, fatigue and some nasal stuffiness along with the pressure. Have you noticed any fever, cough, or sore throat with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't been coughing. My throat… maybe a little scratchy sometimes, but not really a sore throat. Just… when I wake up, maybe. It’s not a big problem. I mostly just want this pressure to go away. It makes it hard to think when I'm at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: I work with… the drills. Rotary drills. For oil and gas. It's… loud work. And sometimes dusty. I have been doing it for… a long time now. I don't know exactly how long. A lot of years. It's good work, but… hard. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Loud and dusty work… okay. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. I eat, and things taste okay. And I can smell when I cook. I don’t pay much attention, though, you understand? I don’t really… cook fancy things. Mostly just beans and rice. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine. Just checking. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or sinus infections before?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… hard to remember. I think… maybe? When I was a little girl, I was sick a lot. But I don't remember what kind of sick. And… I don’t really go to the doctor very often. My husband, he takes care of things when I'm not feeling well. He gives me tea and lets me rest. I haven't been told I have anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I’ve been lucky, I think. Just… bumps and bruises from work sometimes. Nothing serious. My husband says I'm too tough for surgeries. He jokes, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do you know if anyone in your family has a history of allergies, asthma, or sinus problems?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother, she always had… problems with her nose. Always sniffing, always blowing. She said it was the dust. We lived in the country, you understand? Lots of dust. And my brother, he had… bad coughs when he was little. But I don't know if that was allergies, or… something else. It was a long time ago. I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of nasal issues in your mother and coughs in your brother. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t take any medicine, usually. Except… when I have a headache, I take… the little white pills. My husband buys them. I don’t know the name. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take… something else. But I try not to. Makes me feel… strange. That’s all. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I haven’t ever… reacted badly to anything. I eat everything. My husband jokes I have a stomach like a goat. He’s always teasing me. I don’t think I have any allergies. But… I haven’t ever tried too many things. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs, and then I’ll take a look in your nose and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I’m just… hoping you can help me with this pressure. It’s been bothering me for a while now. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Your ears look normal as well. Now, your nasal passages do look a little swollen and there's some mucus present. It’s not severe, but it could be contributing to the pressure you're feeling. Do you feel any pain when I press on your forehead or around your cheeks?
PATIENT: Yes… when you press here, on my cheek, it hurts a little. Not a bad pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… maybe a little bit on my forehead too, but not as much. Does that mean something is… wrong?
DOCTOR: It could mean you have some inflammation in your sinuses, which is consistent with what you've been describing. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it does explain the pressure and pain. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it's likely you're experiencing sinusitis, or a sinus infection. It's quite common, especially with your type of work. We can start with some conservative treatment to see if that helps. Would you be open to trying a saline nasal rinse and a decongestant for a week or so?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it will help, then yes, I will try it. A saline rinse… what does that mean, exactly? And the decongestant… is that a pill? I don’t want anything that will make me feel too strange. I just want to be able to think at work, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. A saline rinse is simply flushing your nasal passages with saltwater. It helps to clear out the mucus and reduce inflammation. You can buy a pre-mixed solution at the pharmacy, or you can make your own with sterile water and salt. It comes in a squeeze bottle or a neti pot. The decongestant is a pill, usually, although there are also nasal sprays. We can start with a pill, and I’ll recommend one that's less likely to cause those… strange feelings you’re concerned about. It helps to open up your nasal passages and relieve the pressure. I'm going to write you a prescription for the decongestant and give you instructions on how to use both the rinse and the medication. If your symptoms don't improve after a week, or if they get worse, please come back and see me, and we can discuss other options. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. A prescription… and instructions. That will be helpful. I will try my best to remember everything. Thank you for listening to me. I feel… better just knowing what might be wrong. And I appreciate you recommending something gentle. I hope this will help me get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Here are the instructions and your prescription. Please read them carefully. If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to see how you're doing, or you can call if you need to come in sooner. I'm optimistic that this will help relieve your symptoms. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You were very kind. I will follow the instructions carefully. And I will call if I need anything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. You have a good day too, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
