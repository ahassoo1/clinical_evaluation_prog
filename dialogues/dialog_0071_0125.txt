DOCTOR: Alright, hello there. I'm Dr. Galena. Good to meet you, Jacquille. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Look, I just… I want to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. I figured it's best to just get it over with. Better safe than sorry, I suppose, even if I highly doubt it’ll be anything. It’s just… a precaution.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. A precautionary HIV test. Good on you for thinking ahead, Jacquille. It’s always best to be proactive. Now, just to get a little more information… have you had any recent… risky behaviors that would make you concerned?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? Doctor, with whom are you implying I'd be engaging in "risky behaviors?" I'm a married man. Honestly. I just… read an article, that’s all. Some scaremongering piece about… well, never mind. It's better to be thorough, I guess, but I assure you my wife and I are perfectly careful. It’s just… a check-up. A very unnecessary check-up, but here we are.
DOCTOR: Oh, I apologize, Jacquille. That wasn’t meant to imply anything at all. It’s standard procedure – we ask everyone about potential exposures as part of the screening process. I didn’t mean to offend. You’re right, a thorough check-up is always a good idea. And to clarify – when you say you read an article… was there anything specific about it that prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Specific? It was… about some new strains, I think. Something about it being harder to detect early on. Honestly, the internet is full of nonsense. I just… my wife gets anxious easily, and it's easier to just get it done than to spend three hours explaining to her why everything is perfectly fine. She’s a bit… dramatic, shall we say? It’s a long story. So, can we just… proceed with the test? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely proceed with the test. New strains… hmm. There have been some reports of slightly different variations, but the standard tests are generally very reliable. It’s good you’re being cautious. Okay, so just a quick overview before we go ahead. We'll need a blood sample, and I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, just for completeness. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Absolutely none. I’m a perfectly healthy specimen, Doctor. Honestly, I doubt anything could actually affect me. My wife makes me take vitamins religiously, so I’m practically immune to everything. Just… get on with it, please. This is taking far too long. Is it a needle? Because I really dislike needles. Though I suppose I'll survive.
DOCTOR: Right, no known allergies. Good. And yes, unfortunately, it will involve a small needle. It's a quick prick, I assure you. We'll take the blood sample from your arm. Before we do that, just quickly… have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Are you seriously implying…? I just… honestly. This is becoming quite insulting, Doctor. I’ve been married for ten years! A perfectly faithful, upstanding marriage, I assure you. This line of questioning is… inappropriate. I came here for a simple test, not an interrogation. Do you need to speak with my wife to confirm this? Perhaps she would be more amenable to answering these… probing questions.
DOCTOR: Jacquille, please, I sincerely apologize if I’ve offended you. That was not my intention at all. You're right, I'm being overly thorough, and I’m letting some routine questions become… insensitive. It's just that we are required to ask about certain things to ensure the most accurate assessment and proper care. I'm sorry. Let’s just skip those questions then, and move straight to the blood draw. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And try not to make a mess. I have a very important meeting this afternoon and I haven't got time to be dealing with bandages and… whatever else. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s far too stressful. Is there anything I need to do? Flex a muscle? Tell you my life story? Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: No life story needed, I assure you. Just relax your arm. We'll use a small tourniquet to make the veins easier to find, and then a quick prick. It'll be over before you know it. Okay, just a little pinch… Alright, all done. Just apply a little pressure here for a few minutes. We'll send this sample to the lab, and the results should be back in about three to five business days. We can call you with the results, or you can check them online through the patient portal. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Three to five business days? That’s ridiculous. My meeting is on Thursday. Honestly, the inefficiency is astounding. Fine. Just… call me. I don’t have time for “patient portals.” And try to be discreet. I don’t want my wife finding out I even came here. It’ll be a disaster. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and compose myself. This has been… a thoroughly unpleasant experience. .
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll keep everything confidential and call you directly with the results. And I apologize again for the wait and any discomfort. …anxious wife… reports of new strains… perhaps a referral to a therapist if anxiety persists… .
