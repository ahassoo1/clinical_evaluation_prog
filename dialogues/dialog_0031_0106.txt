DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s about my foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, this sore. It won’t heal. And frankly, I’ve seen enough doctors in my life to know when something isn’t right, and this isn’t right. I have the sugar sickness, you know. Diabetes. It causes problems.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It’s certainly frustrating when something doesn’t heal as it should, and your experience is very valuable. And yes, diabetes can definitely contribute to healing issues. We'll get to the bottom of this. Could you tell me a little more about the sore on your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, it's on the bottom, near my heel. It started as just a little…blister, I suppose. Now? It’s red, and deep. And painful. Especially when I try to walk. I try not to, mostly. Don't want to make it worse. I’ve been putting ointment on it, the kind they sell at the store, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Honestly, these modern remedies... they aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Cannington. It sounds quite bothersome. A red, deep sore near the heel that's painful with walking, and not improving with over-the-counter ointment… that does warrant a closer look. Just to clarify, when did you first notice this blister starting?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was after I got new shoes. About a month ago, maybe a little more. I thought they were comfortable at first, but then it started rubbing. I just figured it was a bit of a blister from breaking in the shoes. Didn't think much of it then. Should have known better, I suppose. Old age, you forget these things. But it didn't get better. Just got worse and worse. Honestly, you young doctors don't listen half the time!
DOCTOR: I understand. A month or so ago, after getting new shoes, and it initially started as a blister from rubbing. I assure you, Ms. Cannington, we do want to listen and understand your concerns. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention now. Now, besides the new shoes, have you noticed any other changes to your foot?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… it’s been a bit numb, sometimes. Not all the time, but especially in my toes. And cold. My foot gets cold easily. Always have had poor circulation, you know. Runs in the family. My grandmother, she had the same problem. Lost a toe, she did. Dreadful thing. I’m hoping it doesn't come to that. And, now that I think of it…it smells a bit. Not pleasant, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Cannington. Numbness, coldness, and a change in odor are all important things to know. Given your history of diabetes and the changes you’ve described, it’s important we take a thorough look. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. And don't go poking around too much. Just look at it. I don’t need a whole lot of fuss. And wash your hands first, please. You doctors touch so many people… one never knows what germs you’re carrying.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I will be very gentle, and I’ve already washed my hands, but I’m happy to do so again for your peace of mind. Now, if you could please remove your shoe and sock, I’ll take a look. I’ll need to visually inspect the area and also check the circulation and sensation in your foot. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Well, alright then. But don’t stare. It’s not a pretty sight, I assure you. And be quick about it. I don’t like being exposed to the cold air. There. Happy now? It’s as bad as you feared, I’m sure. You young people worry too much, though. A bit of ointment and a bandage will do just fine. Though… it does seem deeper than I thought.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. You are right, it is quite inflamed, and it does appear deeper than a simple blister. I’m checking the circulation in your foot now, and the pulses are present, although somewhat diminished. The sensation… is reduced in certain areas. Given your history of diabetes, the decreased sensation, and the appearance of the sore, I am concerned about the possibility of an infection and potential osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. We need to rule that out. I would like to order an X-ray of your foot to assess the bone, and I’ll also need to take a sample of the fluid from the sore to be analyzed in the lab. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Infection? Osteomyelitis? See? I knew it was serious! All those young doctors dismissing it as a simple sore! My grandmother, she had bone infections, too. Dreadful pain, she had. Fine. Do your X-rays and your…fluid samples. But I expect a clear explanation of everything. And I don't want any unnecessary procedures. I’m an old woman, you know. I can't tolerate a lot of poking and prodding. And don't give me any of those new-fangled antibiotics that cause all sorts of side effects. I prefer the old remedies, if possible. Though, I suppose, if it’s truly serious… do what you have to. Just be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington, and I assure you we will proceed with the most careful and appropriate approach. We'll take all of your preferences into account. The X-ray will help us determine if the infection has spread to the bone. The fluid sample will identify the type of bacteria causing the infection, so we can choose the most effective antibiotic, if needed. We'll start with the X-ray. I'll send you over to the radiology department, and it should only take a few minutes. Then, we’ll gently collect a sample of fluid from the sore, which may cause a slight pinch. After we have the results, we’ll discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Just one. How long will this take? I have a luncheon with my friends tomorrow. I promised to bring my famous coconut pudding. I can’t be late. They’ll be terribly disappointed. And, will I be able to walk afterwards? I don’t want to be stuck at home, helpless. Honestly, doctors these days… always making a fuss about nothing. My grandmother would have just wrapped it in a clean cloth and been done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the luncheon and your ability to walk. We’ll do everything we can to minimize any disruption to your schedule. The X-ray should take about 15-20 minutes, and the fluid sample collection will only take a few minutes. Regarding walking, you should be able to walk afterwards, though I would advise taking it easy and avoiding putting too much weight on your foot until we know the results. We’ll provide you with instructions on wound care and weight-bearing restrictions. I will let the radiology staff know you're coming and will be as quick as possible. Once the results are available, we'll discuss them with you and formulate a plan. I'll have a nurse come and get you shortly to escort you to radiology. Do you need any assistance getting up?
PATIENT: Hmph. I can manage. I'm not completely helpless, you know. Just get it over with quickly. And be sure to tell the radiology people to be gentle. I don't want any unnecessary pain. And don't forget, I have a luncheon tomorrow! I need to be able to walk. Honestly, you young doctors… always so much fuss and bother. My grandmother… . Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will personally speak with the radiology staff to ensure your comfort and gentle handling. I have made a note of your luncheon tomorrow and will prioritize getting these results back to you as quickly as possible. I will have the nurse come and escort you now. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Nurse, could you please come assist Ms. Cannington with going to radiology?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. . Honestly, waiting is the worst part of all this… and the poking and prodding, of course. My grandmother always said… . Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: .
