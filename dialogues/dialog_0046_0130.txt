DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you here?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my family… they have lots of sickness. Heart things, mostly. My mother, her sister… even my grandfather. I’m okay now, but I worry. I want to make sure I don't get it, you know? Just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart conditions. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. To get a better understanding of your current health status and risk factors, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good. Questions are okay. I don't always remember everything, so if you need me to say it again, just let me know. What kind of questions?
DOCTOR: Certainly, no problem at all. We can take things at your pace, and I’m happy to repeat anything if needed. Let's start with your current health. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all – anything that feels off, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I’m an old man! I think that’s just… old age. No chest pain, no trouble breathing. Nothing like my cousin Harold had before… before he got sick. But I walk okay. I still do some work, you know, selling things. So, I guess I’m okay. Mostly okay.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. It's helpful to know you’re able to maintain your daily activities. And it’s good you can differentiate those symptoms from what your cousin Harold experienced. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… what was that last one? Cholesterol? No, I don't think so. The doctor, a long time ago, said my blood pressure was a little high once. He gave me a pill, but I didn’t like how it made me feel. So, I stopped taking it. I haven’t really been to the doctor much since. It’s… expensive, you know? And I felt okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and side effects, Mr. Schwer. It's important to feel comfortable with any treatment plan. Okay, so you had a one-time elevated blood pressure reading and discontinued medication. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… No surgeries. Never had one. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. They just put a cast on it. No hospital stays, not really. Except… when my wife was sick. I stayed with her, but it wasn’t for me. Just… just to be there. She passed away a few years back. Sorry. It’s hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Schwer. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to talk about. Please take your time. Now, thinking about your family history a little more specifically… you mentioned heart conditions. Can you tell me more about which relatives were affected, and what exactly they had, if you know?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mother, she had a weak heart. That’s what the doctor said. She got very tired, very easily. Then her sister, my aunt, she had… something with the pipes, you know, the ones that pump the blood. She needed a thing put in, a little metal thing. A… a stent, I think my son said. My grandfather… he just… stopped breathing one night. The doctor said it was his heart, but I don't remember much. I was just a boy. They all smoked a lot, if that matters. They liked cigarettes. I don’t smoke. Never did.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Mr. Schwer. A family history of heart conditions, particularly with relatives experiencing weakness, needing stents, and sudden cardiac events, is definitely something we need to consider. And you’re right, smoking is a significant risk factor, so it's good you’ve never smoked. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when the pollen is bad, but that's just spring, you know? No medicine allergies that I know of. I eat everything. I like spicy food, actually. Makes me cough a little, but I like it. I don’t think I'm allergic to anything serious. No bees, no peanuts, nothing like that. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not anymore. Like I said, I stopped the blood pressure pill a long time ago. I don’t take vitamins. I used to take a little fish oil, my son told me it was good for the brain, but I ran out and didn't buy more. I mostly just drink tea. Green tea. Does that count? I like the taste. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: No, green tea doesn’t count as a medication. Okay, so no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Thank you, Mr. Schwer. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. Physical exam is fine. Just be gentle, okay? My bones are a little old now. And don’t mind if I ask questions. I like to know what you're doing. What are you listening for, exactly? Is it bad if it sounds… funny?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I’ll be very gentle. And absolutely, please ask any questions you have – I’m happy to explain everything as we go. What I’m listening for is the rhythm and sounds of your heart and lungs. A normal heartbeat should be regular and have a certain quality to it. Sometimes, abnormalities – like murmurs or extra sounds – can indicate underlying issues. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong if something sounds different, but it’s helpful information. I’ll start with your blood pressure. This cuff will tighten around your arm for a moment. It may feel a bit snug, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Okay. Tight cuff is fine. My arm's a little thin, you might need to look carefully. My son says I should eat more meat. He worries about my weight. But I like tea better. What number are you looking for? Is higher bad? Everything feels… wobbly sometimes, if I stand up too fast. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: You are right, your arm is a bit thin, I'll make sure the cuff is the correct size. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so, and it's understandable given your history and potentially some anxiety about being here. We will want to monitor that. The feeling of being wobbly when standing up quickly is called orthostatic hypotension, and it can be common as we age, sometimes related to blood pressure or dehydration. It's something we should discuss. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m hearing a regular rhythm, but there’s a very faint murmur. It’s not loud, but it’s worth noting. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it could be a sign of a valve issue. I'll also listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Everything else looks good on a basic exam. Now, I would like to order a few blood tests and an EKG to get a clearer picture of your heart health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? EKG? What does that even do? Is it expensive? My son will be mad if I spend too much money. Does it hurt? I don't like needles. And what about the murmur? Is that bad? Should I be worried? You're making me nervous now. Is it something serious? My mother… she had so many problems…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when hearing medical terms and thinking about tests. Let me explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood tests will help us check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. They will also give us a baseline to compare future results to. The EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us identify any irregular rhythms or signs of previous heart problems. It doesn’t involve needles, just small stickers placed on your chest, arms, and legs. Regarding the murmur, it’s a sound that’s often harmless, especially if it’s faint like yours. However, it’s important to investigate it further to rule out any underlying valve issues. That’s why I’m recommending the EKG and blood tests. It’s better to be safe and have a clear understanding of your heart health. The cost of the tests will depend on your insurance coverage, Medicare should cover most of it. We can discuss that with the billing department and see what your out-of-pocket expenses will be. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were important for your health. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so no needles for the EKG? That's good. Just… stickers. And Medicare will pay for it? I hope so. I don’t want to worry my son. He already worries too much. The murmur… you said it’s probably nothing? But you want to check anyway? Just to be sure? Okay. I think I understand. It’s better to know, even if it’s bad. I guess. So… how do we do these tests? And when? And what happens after? Will you tell me what everything means? In plain English, please. I don’t understand doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Schwer. Just stickers for the EKG, and we'll check with Medicare to confirm your coverage. And yes, the murmur is most likely harmless, but we want to be thorough and rule out anything serious. It's a precautionary measure. We can schedule the EKG and blood tests today. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn’t take too long. They will draw a small amount of blood. As for the blood draw, it’s quick, but it does involve a needle. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and they'll make it as comfortable as possible. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will explain everything in plain English, I promise. I will go over each result with you and answer any questions you have. We’ll go over the results one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. Down the hall is good. Close. And you promise plain English? No doctor words? The needle… I hate needles. But if you say it’s quick… and the phlebotomist is good… alright. I’ll do it. So, let’s get it over with. Schedule the tests. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can stop worrying. Just… tell me where to go. And how long it will take. And will I be tired afterwards? I don't want to collapse.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mr. Schwer. I understand your anxiety about the needle, and we'll take it one step at a time. I've scheduled you for an EKG and blood draw with our excellent phlebotomist, Sarah, in the lab just down the hall, room 102. They are expecting you in about fifteen minutes. It shouldn’t take longer than an hour total – about twenty minutes for the EKG and then forty for the blood draw, allowing time to sit and rest afterwards. You may feel a little tired afterwards, but it’s usually mild. It’s important to drink plenty of fluids and have a small snack. We'll have you sit for a few minutes before you leave to make sure you’re feeling stable. Sarah and the lab technicians will make sure you’re comfortable. Here’s a slip of paper with the lab’s location and my name. If you feel unwell at any point, please don’t hesitate to let them know or come back and see me. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Down the hall, fifteen minutes, Sarah… and drink fluids. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient. And you promised plain English, remember? I’ll go see Sarah now. I hope she's good with needles.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. And yes, I absolutely promise plain English. I’ll be here when you get back, and we'll take it one step at a time. .
