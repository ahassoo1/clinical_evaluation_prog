DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m hoping you can help me with something for a cruise I’m planning. They’ve asked for some… medical information, and I thought it best to get it sorted properly with a doctor’s help. It’s just a form, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a form for a cruise. I see. That's perfectly reasonable. Let's get some information down, then. To start, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve generally been quite well, thank you. I don’t get much sick, if you know what I mean. A bit of a cold now and then, like everyone gets, but nothing serious. I try to keep active, you see. I do a good bit of walking, and I’m quite particular about my diet. Nothing too rich, and plenty of fruit. Is there anything specific you’d like to know? I don’t really go to doctors often, so I’m not sure what’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Keeping active and eating well is excellent. Okay, let's try to cover all the bases. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never been told I have any of those things. My late husband, bless him, he had a touch of arthritis in his knees towards the end, but I haven’t had any trouble with my joints, thankfully. The doctor we had back home, Doctor MacIntyre, always said my blood pressure was perfectly fine, when he checked it during my yearly visits. He retired a few years ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never needed any, thankfully. I had all my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, of course, but that was all done at the dentist. Not a proper surgery, if you know what I mean. Just a bit of local anesthetic and a few tugs. Nothing major. Is that the sort of thing you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. We're looking for anything requiring a hospital stay or general anesthesia. Okay, how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to a good age, nearly ninety, but she did have some trouble with her heart towards the end. My father was… quite strong, really, but he passed away suddenly from a stroke when I was still young. My brother, he’s still living, and as far as I know, he’s perfectly healthy, although he does enjoy a good pie, if you understand. Is there anything specific I should be telling you about? It's difficult to remember everything, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Knowing about the heart trouble and stroke is helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve taken all sorts of over-the-counter remedies for colds and headaches over the years without any trouble at all. I’m not one for taking much, mind you, but when I do, I’ve never had a problem. Is there a particular medication I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I don’t take a thing, regularly. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, when there’s not much sun, but I haven’t bothered with it lately. I try to get enough sunshine when I can. Otherwise, nothing. I believe in a good diet and plenty of fresh air, you see. Is that… unusual? I’m not sure what people usually take.
DOCTOR: No, not at all unusual. That's actually quite sensible. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Before we move on, let's quickly check your height and weight, if that's alright. It's just a routine part of the check-up.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I haven’t been weighed in years, I should think. I’m quite particular about my figure, you see. It’s important to keep an eye on these things. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please step onto the scale for me. I’ll just note the reading. Okay, 171 centimeters and 109 pounds. That's… quite a healthy weight for your height. Now, before we finish, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were dreadful for you, and I’ve always taken her advice. And as for alcohol… well, I might have a small glass of sherry at Christmas, with the family, but that’s about it. I don't really have a taste for it, to be honest. It doesn’t agree with me. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking. Okay, last few questions. Do you have any current medical problems, anything bothering you at all – pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I feel quite well, all things considered. I get a little tired after a long walk, naturally, but nothing more than you’d expect. No pain, no shortness of breath, nothing at all that’s worrying me. I sleep well, eat well, and generally feel quite fit. I sometimes get a little ache in my back, but that’s just from bending down in the garden, you see. I do a lot of weeding.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, everything sounds remarkably good. Based on what you've told me, there are no immediate concerns. It sounds like you're very healthy. To complete the form for your cruise, I can confirm that you have no known allergies, no current medical conditions, and you're not taking any regular medication. Is there anything specific the form asks about that we haven't covered?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful to hear, Doctor! That’s a great relief. Let me see… Yes, here we are. It asks about… “history of mental illness.” I’ve never been anything like that, Doctor. I’ve always been quite level-headed, if you know what I mean. And it asks about… “mobility issues.” Well, I walk a good few miles every week, so I’d say my mobility is quite good. Is there anything else I should be looking at? The writing is a bit small, you see.
DOCTOR: No, that covers it. "History of mental illness" – no, you've stated that clearly, and based on our conversation, that's accurate. "Mobility issues" – also no, you're quite active. I'll just add a note confirming "no known history of mental illness" and "full mobility". Here you go. This is a summary of our consultation, confirming your medical history and fitness to travel. It should be sufficient for your cruise form. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, Doctor, thank you so much! That’s a great weight off my mind. No, I don’t think I do, actually. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve put my mind completely at ease. I appreciate your time and your help very much. I'm so looking forward to this cruise now, knowing I'm fit and healthy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! If anything does come up while you’re travelling, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a wonderful time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will, and I certainly will. Goodbye, and thank you again for everything.
