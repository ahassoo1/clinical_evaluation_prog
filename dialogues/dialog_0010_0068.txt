DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s after… you know, the cancer stuff. I had treatment, and now this leg… it’s not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, “cancer stuff” and now leg swelling. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about the treatment you had?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… a lot of appointments. And then… they gave me… drops. And pills. And… something with a needle. It was at the hospital, of course. A big hospital. I don’t really remember what they called everything, to be honest. It was… a while ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to forget details, especially with everything you’ve been through. It looks like you were seen at St. Jude’s Hospital a couple of years ago for… breast cancer, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s right. Breast cancer. St. Jude’s… yes. That was a… difficult time. And now this leg… it’s getting bigger, you see? It’s hard to walk sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. And when did you first notice the swelling in your leg?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… maybe a month ago? It started small, just a little puffiness. I thought it was just… getting old, you know? But it’s gotten worse. It’s mostly in my right leg. It feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, starting in the right leg, and feeling heavy. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or any injury to the leg?
PATIENT: No, no injury. I haven’t… fallen or anything. It just… gets worse when I'm on my feet too long, I think. And… at the end of the day. It’s better when I put my feet up. I try to rest it, but… you know, life. Things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Life goes on. And you're right, resting it helps. Now, aside from the swelling and heaviness, are you experiencing any pain in your leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really pain, exactly. It’s more… achy. A dull ache. Especially in the evening. And sometimes… it feels… tight. Like a band around my leg. Not a sharp pain, though. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and tightness, worse in the evening. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your leg?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin…? Let me see… It looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little red sometimes? But I have… sensitive skin. It gets red easily. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible redness, but you have sensitive skin generally. Now, have you had any trouble with blood clots in the past?
PATIENT: Blood clots…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so? I don’t remember anything like that. I’ve had… lots of tests over the years, with the cancer and all. But I don’t recall anyone saying anything about clots. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s alright. According to your records, you had a D-dimer test a few years ago that came back normal, which is reassuring. Now, let's do a quick exam of your leg. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. An examination… good. Is this okay? I'm not very flexible, you know.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, I'm going to gently feel your leg, starting with your thigh, to check for any tenderness or swelling. I'll also measure the circumference of both legs to see if there's a difference in size. Okay, your right thigh feels slightly warmer than your left. And the circumference is… two centimeters larger than your left thigh at this point. Now, I'm going to check your calf.
PATIENT: Two centimeters… that sounds like a lot, doesn’t it? It feels… tight. Yes, very tight. Be careful, please. It's a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm being very careful. Your right calf feels slightly firm to the touch. And the circumference here is… three centimeters larger than your left. There’s some mild pitting edema around your ankle. So, to summarize, your right leg is warmer, slightly firmer, and three centimeters larger in circumference than your left. There’s also some mild swelling around your ankle. It sounds like you likely have lymphedema, possibly related to your previous cancer treatment. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Lymp-e-de-ma…? Oh dear. Is that bad? Related to the cancer… it always comes back, doesn’t it? A blood clot… oh, that sounds scary. What do we do?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Queener. Lymphedema is a common side effect of cancer treatment, especially after lymph nodes have been removed or damaged. It happens when fluid builds up in the tissues because the lymphatic system isn't draining properly. It’s not usually dangerous, but it can cause discomfort and swelling, as you’re experiencing. To rule out a blood clot, I’d like to order a D-dimer test, and possibly an ultrasound of your leg. The ultrasound will help us visualize the blood vessels and check for any clots. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Tests… yes, I suppose so. If it will make sure there isn’t a… a clot. Compression stockings…? I don't know if I can wear those. They sound… tight. But if you think it’s best. And elevating my leg… I can do that. I like to watch TV. So, tests and… stockings.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab right away. The lab technician will come and draw some blood for the D-dimer test. And I’ll have the nurse come in and show you how to put on the compression stockings, and make sure they fit properly. They’ll be snug, but they should not be painful. They help to improve circulation and reduce swelling. We'll get the results back within a day or two, and then we can discuss a long-term management plan. This might include physical therapy, specialized massage techniques, and continued use of compression stockings. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Just… please make sure it’s not a clot. That’s my biggest worry. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I understand your concern, and we're taking all the necessary steps to find out what's going on. I'll be sure to review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them thoroughly. The nurse will be in shortly with the compression stockings and to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if anything changes or you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
