DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been… difficult, lately. Sort of slurred, you know? I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. Things have been… a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Speech difficulties can be concerning. "Hectic" can definitely play a role in things, but we want to figure out what's going on. When you say “slurred,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not constant, not like I always sound off. Sometimes words just don't come out right. Like… mushy, maybe? Or like I’m trying to say something with my mouth full, even when I’m not. My husband noticed it first, actually. He said I was sounding strange over breakfast a few days ago. I didn’t really think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mushy” and like you’re speaking with something in your mouth – that’s helpful. And it’s good your husband noticed. It’s often easier for someone else to pick up on these changes. Has this been happening every day since then, or just sporadically?
PATIENT: Sporadically, I believe. It’s not… every single day. There have been some days where I don't notice anything at all, and then other days it's more pronounced. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific, if that makes sense. I haven't changed anything in my routine recently… not that I recall, at least. I do work quite a bit, though, if that could be a factor. Long hours on the construction site.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes, and doesn’t seem linked to a specific activity. Long hours on a construction site could definitely be a factor - physically demanding work can do a lot. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But honestly, with the work… I just put that down to exhaustion. No headaches, no dizziness… nothing that immediately springs to mind. My arms feel a bit heavy sometimes, but again, that could be from lifting things all day. I’m not really sure if that’s related. It’s all a bit… vague, really. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, vague is common when we’re trying to figure things out. Fatigue and heavy arms could be related, it's good you mentioned them. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… not that I’m aware of. I had the usual childhood things, chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I broke my arm when I was little, but it healed perfectly fine. My husband handles most of the medical paperwork, so I don’t always know the specifics. I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful? And I’m… married, as I mentioned earlier. I don’t really have a family doctor, to be honest. We just go to the urgent care when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Medicare is helpful information, and I see you’re married. No significant past medical history, just the broken arm. And you use urgent care normally. Have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I… I believe I had my wisdom teeth removed years ago. That's the only thing I can recall. It was… quite a while ago, maybe ten or fifteen years? Nothing else comes to mind. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t the best. Things just… slip my mind. My husband would probably know more details than I would. He's very good with remembering things like dates and appointments.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Wisdom teeth removal is good to know. It’s common to not remember every detail. And it’s great you have someone who helps with that. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like stroke, heart disease, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t… I don’t really know much about her medical history. She didn’t talk about it much. My father is still alive, but he lives in Jamaica, and we don’t speak very often. I know he had high blood pressure, I think, but that’s about it. I don’t know of any strokes or neurological problems, but… honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was something. It just wasn’t something we discussed much as a family. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's common for family medical history to be unclear. High blood pressure in your father is good to know. Let's move on to your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t take any medications regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches, if needed. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter ibuprofen. And no vitamins or supplements, either. I try to eat a healthy diet, when I have the time, but I don’t really bother with those things. As for allergies… I don’t think I have any. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’m not allergic to any foods, and I haven’t had any issues with insect bites or anything like that. Again, my husband might remember more details, but I’m fairly certain I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or allergies, just occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Could you follow my finger with your eyes, keeping your head still?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is this okay? I’m following it… I think. It's a little difficult to focus, but I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Very good. Now, could you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels a little… off, maybe? I don't usually think about how I smile.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you please frown for me?
PATIENT: Is that… okay? It’s a little hard to concentrate on frowning, I don’t usually make faces. It feels a bit… uneven, maybe? I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you puff out your cheeks with air, like a fish?
PATIENT: Like this? Is it alright? It feels… weak, maybe? I can’t hold it for very long. I think some air is leaking out. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can. I don’t usually think about how strong my hands are. It’s a bit difficult to tell if I’m doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Please relax your arm. And relax your leg.
PATIENT: Is that alright? That feels… strange. It made me jump a little. I'm not very good at relaxing, I think. It's a bit unnerving.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Everything seems normal so far. Now, could you please walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I feel a bit wobbly. It’s harder than I thought. I usually walk faster, but I’m trying to be careful. I hope I’m not stumbling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright. Thank you for your patience through that exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but there are a few subtle findings that I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was a little worried there for a moment. What did you find? What do you think is going on? Is it something serious? I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. I was starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your anxiety. Let's go over the findings. Your cranial nerves are intact, meaning the nerves controlling your facial movements and senses are functioning properly. Your heart and lungs sound clear. However, I did note very subtle weakness in your grip strength, bilaterally, and slightly diminished reflexes in both your arms and legs. Your gait was normal, but I did notice a slight hesitancy. Given your age and symptoms – specifically the intermittent slurred speech, fatigue, and subtle neurological findings – I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign like muscle fatigue, or it could be an early sign of a neurological condition. To rule things out, I'd like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and thyroid function. I also want to get an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of your neurological health. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… serious. Is it definitely necessary? I was hoping it would be something simple. What kind of neurological condition are you thinking about? And what will the blood work tell us? I’m a little scared, Doctor. It’s just… it’s all a bit frightening. I don’t want anything serious to be wrong. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgement. Please, explain it to me like I’m five. What does all of this mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your fear, and I'm here to explain everything as clearly as possible. Let's take it one step at a time. Think of your body like a really complicated machine, with lots of different parts working together. Sometimes, those parts can get a little out of tune, and that can cause problems. The blood work is like checking the oil and fluids in the machine. It helps us see if everything is at the right level and working properly. We're checking for things like vitamin deficiencies - if you don't have enough vitamins, it can make you feel tired and weak. We're also checking your thyroid, which is a little gland that controls your energy levels. The MRI is like taking an X-ray of your brain. It lets us see the different parts of your brain and make sure everything looks normal. It doesn't hurt, you just lie very still inside a big machine. It helps us rule out any serious problems, like a small blockage or inflammation. Now, I'm not saying you definitely have something serious. We’re just being cautious and ruling things out. The intermittent slurred speech and subtle weakness are enough for me to want to investigate further. There are many possibilities, some more serious than others. But the earlier we catch anything, the easier it is to treat. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense. Like checking the oil and fluids, that’s a good way to put it. And the MRI isn’t necessarily because you think something’s wrong wrong, just to be safe? It's not like… a sign that things are really bad? And how long does the MRI take? Will I need someone to drive me? I do get a little claustrophobic, so the thought of being inside a machine is a bit scary. It's just… it's all a lot to process, and I don’t want to worry my husband unnecessarily. He gets very anxious easily.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask all of these questions, and it’s good you’re thinking about your husband too. No, the MRI is not a sign that things are definitely bad. It's a precautionary step, a more detailed look to help us understand what's going on. Think of it like getting a second opinion – we want to be thorough and make sure we don't miss anything. The MRI usually takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll lie on a table inside a large, tube-shaped machine. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to stay very still. And yes, you will need someone to drive you home, because they sometimes use a mild sedative to help you relax. Also, if you have any metal in your body – like implants or piercings – you'll need to let the technician know beforehand. As for the claustrophobia, that’s very common. You can close your eyes, listen to music, or let the technician know if you're feeling anxious, and they can help. They can also give you a medication to help with that anxiety if needed. We can discuss options for that if you’re concerned. I’ll write you a referral for the MRI, and I'll also give you a list of things to tell the technician. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. For now, let’s focus on getting the MRI scheduled. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Scheduling the MRI sounds like a good first step. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. A list of things to tell the technician is a good idea, too. I'll make sure to bring someone with me, and I'll let them know about my claustrophobia. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. And thank you for the reassurance about the sedative. I appreciate it. I’ll trust your judgement, and I’ll try not to worry too much. I guess we just have to wait and see what the MRI shows. I really do appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. It's my job to help you, and I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all before your MRI. And remember, we're taking this one step at a time. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the MRI for you, and they’ll give you all the necessary information. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on doing the things you enjoy. I’ll see you back here once we have the results. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I don't need a work note at the moment. I can manage. But thank you for offering. I think I’ll just take things as they come. I appreciate it, Doctor. I think that’s all for now, isn’t it? I’ll see you when the results are back. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day as well, and I'll see you soon. Goodbye.
