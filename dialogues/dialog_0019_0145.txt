DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome in. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today, if you will, to discuss the possibility of home health care. Or, perhaps, hospice care. My… situation requires some certification, I understand. It is for my mother, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, home health or hospice… for your mother. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely explore those options. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about what’s going on with your mother?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother… she is quite old, you understand. Ninety-two years, this coming November. She has… well, she has trouble with many things now. She falls frequently, despite our best efforts. And she… she is very weak. She mostly stays in bed these days. She… does not eat much, either. It has been… difficult. She is at a care facility currently, but… we would prefer her to be at home, if possible. With assistance, naturally.
DOCTOR: Ninety-two… that’s wonderful she’s lived such a full life. And it sounds like she does need some extra support, and you’re a good son for wanting to provide that for her. Falls are always concerning, and a decreased appetite at that age… well, it’s something we need to look into. Just to get a clearer picture, has she been officially diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has been diagnosed with… several things, actually. She has… what is it called… dementia, I believe. And… and her heart is not strong. The doctors at the facility said she has… congestive heart failure. And… arthritis, of course. Very painful arthritis in her hips and knees. They… they have a list, actually. I can… I can ask the facility to send it over to you, if that would be helpful. They have all the details.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, yes. Thank you. Knowing her full medical history is crucial. Dementia and congestive heart failure… those certainly explain a lot of what you're describing. And arthritis on top of that… it’s understandable things are difficult. Now, when you say she doesn't eat much, can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly. She… she maybe takes a few bites of soft food, once or twice a day. Mostly, she just… sips on water, or juice. She used to enjoy… well, she used to enjoy everything. But now… she seems to have no appetite at all. We try to offer her favorites, but… she mostly just pushes it away. The nurses at the facility try to encourage her, but… they said she has lost a significant amount of weight. I… I am worried about her nutrition, of course. And her strength. She is so frail.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. A significant weight loss coupled with a decreased appetite… we need to assess that. Has she had any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. I… I do not believe so. She… she does not cough when she eats, or drink. And she does not choke. But… sometimes, she seems to… she seems to have trouble chewing. Especially… harder foods. She prefers things that are very soft, or… pureed, if you will. But… I have not noticed her actually struggling to swallow. Though, I am not with her constantly, you understand. The nurses are, of course. Perhaps they have noticed something I have not.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s good information. And it's good you've noticed she prefers softer foods. We’ll definitely want to confirm with the nurses about any potential swallowing difficulties. It's subtle things like that that can be important. Now, let's talk about the care facility for a moment. How long has your mother been there?
PATIENT: She has been at the facility… let me see… approximately six months, now. We… we initially hoped it would be temporary. Just to… to give her some extra support after a fall. But… her condition has declined since then. We… we visit her regularly, of course. My sister and I, we try to go as often as possible. But… it is not the same as being at home, you understand. She… she misses her garden, and her books. And… and her cat. She keeps asking about her cat. It is… difficult for everyone.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it sounds like she's longing for home. That’s completely understandable. It's good you and your sister are so involved. Before we discuss home health or hospice specifically, I'd like to get a better sense of her overall medical status. Are you aware of any specific medications she's currently taking?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She is on… several medications, actually. Let me see… she takes something for her heart, I believe. A… a beta blocker, perhaps? And something for her dementia. A… a pill to help with her memory. And… something for the pain, of course. She has a lot of pain in her hips and knees. And… a blood thinner, to prevent clots. She has a lot of pills, you understand. The nurses at the facility manage them all. I… I do not know the exact names, I am afraid. But they have a list, of course. I can ask them to send that over as well. With the other records. It would be… much easier, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A complete medication list is crucial, and I appreciate you offering to get that from the facility. That will be very helpful. Now, just one more general question before we start to talk about the options available to you. Has your mother expressed any wishes regarding her end-of-life care?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question, Doctor. She… she used to be very clear about things. But… with the dementia, her memory is not what it used to be. She… sometimes she is very lucid, and sometimes she is… confused. She has… she has mentioned not wanting to be in pain, of course. But… she has not made any specific arrangements, or… or a living will, or anything like that. We… we have talked about it, but… she was never very comfortable discussing those things. It is… difficult. I am not sure what she would want now, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for those with dementia to not have a clear advance care plan, and it’s understandable why she wouldn’t be comfortable discussing it. We can certainly work with what we know, and focus on keeping her comfortable and respecting her dignity. Okay. So, let's talk about what you're hoping to achieve with home health or hospice care. What are your primary concerns, and what kind of support are you looking for?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my primary concern is my mother’s comfort. She is in pain, and she is weak. I want her to be as comfortable as possible, for as long as possible. And… I want her to be at home, if that is possible. She misses her home, and… and we want to be able to spend more time with her, in a familiar environment. We… we are not able to provide the level of care she needs at home, without assistance. We… we need help with the medication, and… and the pain management, and… and just the general care. We need someone to… to be there with her, to make sure she is comfortable and safe. And… and if it comes to it, we need someone to… to help us with the end-of-life care, if that is necessary. We… we want her to be peaceful, and… and we want to be there for her.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable. It sounds like you're looking for comprehensive support – pain management, medication assistance, and compassionate care in a familiar environment. Both home health and hospice could be options, but they’re different. Home health focuses on rehabilitation and managing a chronic illness, with the goal of improving her quality of life. Hospice, on the other hand, is specifically for those with a limited life expectancy, focusing on comfort and symptom management. Given what you’ve told me about your mother’s condition – the dementia, the heart failure, the weight loss – it’s possible she might be eligible for hospice. But we need to confirm that with a thorough assessment. Do you have any questions about the difference between the two, or anything else?
PATIENT: That… that is helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I… I must admit, I am a little confused about the eligibility for hospice. She is… she is very weak, but… she is still alive, you understand? And… and she sometimes has moments of clarity. Is she… is she too “alive” for hospice? That is… that is probably a foolish question. But… I am not sure what the requirements are. And… and I do not want to rush into anything, if it is not necessary. I… I just want what is best for her, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s not a foolish question at all, Mr. Bahta. It’s perfectly reasonable to be unsure. Hospice isn't about giving up; it's about shifting the focus from curative treatment to comfort and quality of life when a cure isn't possible. The eligibility criteria typically involve a doctor’s certification that a patient has a life expectancy of six months or less, if the illness runs its usual course. It doesn’t mean she has to be actively dying, or completely unresponsive. She can still have moments of clarity, and we can continue to manage her symptoms and provide comfort. We’d need to do a complete assessment to determine if she meets the criteria. I’d want to review the records from the facility, do a physical exam, and talk to the nurses to get a better understanding of her overall condition. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… that sounds very reasonable. I… I would be very comfortable with that. The records from the facility… I have already asked them to send them over. And… and I am happy to answer any questions you have, or… or to provide any additional information. I just want what is best for my mother, you understand. And… and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It… it is very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bahta. That's what I'm here for. And you're a very thoughtful son; it's clear you’re doing everything you can for your mother. Let’s start by reviewing those records when they arrive, and then we can schedule a physical exam. We’ll take it one step at a time. While we wait for the records, could you tell me a little bit about your mother’s typical day at the facility?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Her typical day… well, she wakes up around 7 o’clock, usually. The nurses help her with her breakfast, and… and her medication. She… she doesn’t eat much, as I mentioned. She mostly just sips on juice, or water. After breakfast, she usually sits in her wheelchair, near the window. She… she likes to watch the birds. Sometimes, she reads a book, if she is feeling up to it. But… she mostly just sits and… and stares out the window. She… she naps a lot during the day. And… and she has lunch around noon, but… she doesn’t eat much of that, either. After lunch, she usually naps again. And… and she has dinner around 6 o’clock, but… she still doesn’t eat much. She… she goes to bed around 8 o’clock. It… it is a very quiet day, you understand. Not much excitement. But… the nurses are very kind to her. They… they do their best to keep her comfortable. It… it is just… sad to see her so weak.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very quiet routine, and it's understandable why it's sad to see her so weak. It sounds like the nurses are providing good care, at least making sure she’s comfortable. So, it sounds like her appetite is a major concern, and her level of activity is quite low. We'll want to assess those things during the exam. Now, just one more question before we wait for the records. Has she had any recent changes in her behavior?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. Yes, actually. In the past few weeks, she has become… more confused, I believe. She… she sometimes forgets who I am, or who my sister is. And… and she sometimes gets agitated, or… or anxious. She… she doesn’t sleep very well, either. She… she wakes up several times during the night, and… and she sometimes wanders around the facility. The nurses said she has been… more restless lately. And… and she has been… more withdrawn, as well. She… she used to enjoy talking to people, but… now she mostly just sits in silence. It… it is very worrying, you understand. It… it is like she is fading away.
DOCTOR: That's definitely something we need to address, Mr. Bahta. A recent change in mental status – increased confusion, agitation, restlessness, withdrawal – could indicate a number of things, and it's important to rule out any underlying causes. It's particularly concerning given her dementia and heart failure. Okay. So, to summarize, you’re concerned about her comfort, her appetite, her low activity level, and these recent changes in her behavior. We’ll do a thorough assessment, review the records from the facility, and then discuss the best course of action. Let’s wait for the records to arrive, and we can schedule the exam. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden changes in her condition – a fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain – please don’t hesitate to call 911 or bring her to the emergency room.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I… I will keep that in mind. And… and I will let you know as soon as the records arrive. I… I appreciate your time, and your… your kindness. It… it is reassuring to know that someone is… is listening. I… I feel a little bit better now, just… just knowing that we are doing everything we can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. And you’re doing everything you can, truly. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll be in touch as soon as the records arrive. Take care. .
