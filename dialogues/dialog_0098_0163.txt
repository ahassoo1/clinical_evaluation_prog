DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, to be quite frank, I’ve been… experimenting, shall we say, with some rather ambitious dietary regimes. I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I… fully commit to anything further. I’m afraid I’m rather prone to enthusiasm, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always wise to get a medical opinion before making significant changes to your diet, especially at your age. Could you tell me a bit more about these regimes?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it began with the grape diet, you know, purely grapes for a fortnight. Rather monotonous, as you might imagine, and yielded… limited results. Then there was the cabbage soup affair. Dreadful stuff, truthfully. Most recently, I’ve been attempting a version of the Breatharian diet – purely living on air and sunlight. Though I confess, I supplemented with a biscuit last Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Right. The Breatharian diet… and a biscuit last Tuesday. That's… good to know. It's quite a range of approaches you've tried. And how have you been feeling during these different diets, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Rather weak, to be honest, Doctor. The grape diet left me perpetually peckish, naturally. The cabbage soup… well, let’s just say the social implications were considerable. And the Breatharian attempt? I felt… strangely lightheaded, and a good deal colder than usual. My wife – my ex-wife, I should add – used to say I looked rather spectral. It’s all a bit silly when I recount it, I suppose. But I was hoping for a… transformative experience.
DOCTOR: Weakness, lightheadedness, feeling cold… those aren't surprising symptoms with such restricted diets, Mr. Vantine. And it’s very good you’re talking about this. Transformative experiences are wonderful, but not at the expense of your health. Before we get into anything further, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve always been quite a healthy chap, actually. No major illnesses, touch wood. Had the usual childhood complaints – measles, mumps, the occasional scrape. I did have a rather nasty bout of influenza in '63, but recovered well. My blood pressure has always been a touch high, monitored by my GP for years, but stable with a small daily dose of medication. Oh, and I had my appendix removed in '88, a rather unpleasant affair, but perfectly routine. I believe that covers the salient points.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, childhood illnesses, influenza in '63, appendix removed in '88, and managed hypertension. And are you currently taking any medication besides what you mentioned for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. Just the daily tablet for the blood pressure, as prescribed. I’m rather fastidious about taking it, I assure you. Wouldn’t dream of missing a dose. It’s the only concession I make to my advancing years, you see. Otherwise, I’m rather proud of my constitution.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: None whatsoever, Doctor. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything put in front of me, thankfully. No shellfish reactions, no hay fever, no unpleasantness with penicillin. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. My ex-wife, however, was dreadfully allergic to cats. A rather relevant detail, perhaps, in explaining the marital breakdown. Though I digress, I apologise.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Vantine. It's good to know you don't have any allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your diet before you started these experiments?
PATIENT: Of course. Before the… adventures, my diet was rather conventional, I suppose. A hearty breakfast – porridge, usually, with a spot of honey. A reasonably light lunch – a sandwich, perhaps, or a salad. And then a sensible dinner – roast chicken on a Sunday, fish on a Friday, and so on. I enjoy a good pudding, I must admit, and I’m rather partial to a glass of sherry with dinner. Nothing extravagant, mind you, but a comfortable, well-balanced diet. I wouldn't claim to be a health fanatic, you see.
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Mr. Vantine. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the family history. Let me see… My father suffered from heart trouble in his later years, unfortunately. And my mother had diabetes, though it wasn’t diagnosed until quite late in life. My only brother – bless his soul – was quite robust, always very active, but he passed away unexpectedly from a stroke a few years ago. Beyond that… nothing particularly noteworthy, I believe. My maternal grandmother lived to the ripe old age of ninety-two, remarkably spry for her age.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s helpful. Now, finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol regularly – beyond the sherry with dinner you mentioned?
PATIENT: No smoking, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My late wife tried, naturally, but I was always rather steadfast in my refusal. As for alcohol, a glass of sherry with dinner, as I mentioned, and perhaps a small brandy on special occasions. Nothing excessive, mind you. And I do enjoy a gentle stroll most days, weather permitting, of course. I wouldn't describe myself as a sportsman, but I keep reasonably active.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Thank you for providing me with such a comprehensive overview. Given your history and recent dietary attempts, I think it would be prudent to perform a quick physical examination and order some blood tests. I want to check your general health, look for any nutritional deficiencies, and assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, quite alright. An examination and blood tests seem perfectly sensible. I’m entirely at your disposal. I rather pride myself on being a cooperative patient. Though, if I may say so, I do hope the tests don’t reveal anything too alarming.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Vantine. It’s likely just a precautionary measure. Let's start with your weight and blood pressure, then we'll listen to your heart and lungs and do a brief abdominal exam. If you’d be comfortable stepping on the scale first?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead on. I confess, my knees aren’t quite what they used to be. Though I still maintain a respectable height, you know. One hundred and eighty-seven centimetres, give or take.
DOCTOR: Alright, your weight is 148 pounds, and your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That's slightly elevated, but consistent with your history. Heart sounds are regular, though a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. And your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain whatsoever. Though a slight rumble, perhaps. I did have a rather substantial lunch, you see. A ham sandwich and a digestive biscuit, if you must know. It seems my dietary transgressions continue to haunt me. But truly, no discomfort at all.
DOCTOR: A slight rumble is perfectly normal, Mr. Vantine. Alright, that completes the physical examination. Now, I’ll need to order some blood tests. I'm going to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, glucose levels, and vitamin levels. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been most thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… eccentricities. I suppose I should refrain from any further dietary experimentation until we have the results, shouldn't I? Though the allure of the moon diet is rather strong at the moment.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, I would strongly advise against any further dietary experiments until we have the results. The moon diet can wait. We want to get a clear baseline before making any changes. It’s possible these recent diets have caused some imbalances, and we need to address those first. The nurse will be with you shortly. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A follow-up appointment is sensible. I shall refrain from any further lunar pursuits. And thank you again for your kindness and understanding. It’s reassuring to have a professional opinion, rather than relying on dubious internet articles.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional. The nurse will be right in, and she will let you know what to expect. In the meantime, please feel free to relax and let me know if you need anything. Is there anything else I can assist you with before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all for now. I believe I’ve exhausted my catalogue of concerns. And thank you once again for your time and expertise. I shall await the nurse’s arrival with… cautious optimism. Perhaps I’ll take a short nap while I wait. It’s been a rather eventful morning, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Vantine. A short nap sounds like a good idea. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Have a good rest. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. And thank you. .
