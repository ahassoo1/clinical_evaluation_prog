DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low. I suppose that's why I'm here. I do hope this won’t take too long, Doctor. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Feeling low" can mean a lot of things. To help me understand better – and hopefully not take too long – could you tell me a little more about what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a heaviness, Doctor. A weight in my chest, mostly. And a lack of… joy, I suppose. Things I used to enjoy – gardening, even spending time with my grandchildren – they don’t bring me the same pleasure. I find myself… just wanting to be alone, mostly. And I sleep a great deal. Or, rather, I try to sleep. It's not restful sleep. Do you follow? It’s hard to put into words, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do follow. A heaviness, loss of enjoyment, wanting to be alone, and disrupted sleep. Has this been a sudden change, or has it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It’s not like there was one specific event. It’s been… building, over the past few months, perhaps six months or so. I initially attributed it to the weather, truthfully. This grey weather… it gets to one, doesn't it? But it hasn’t lifted, even with the warmer days. And now… well, now it's affecting everything. I don’t even have the energy to tend to my roses. It's quite embarrassing, really. A gardener without the will to garden.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it’s impacting your daily activities. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it's practically nonexistent. I used to enjoy a good meal, Doctor. Nigerian food, you know, very flavorful. Now? I have to make myself eat. And even then, it feels… tasteless. My daughter keeps bringing me soups, thinking it will help, but… it just sits there. It’s quite frustrating. I'm losing weight, I suspect. Though I haven't checked recently. I avoid the scales, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I see. Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss… Are you experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or remembering things?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes. It’s not severe, but I do find myself… forgetful. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I went to the kitchen for… that sort of thing. I used to have a very sharp mind, Doctor. I managed a business for years, you know. Very detail-oriented work. It’s… disconcerting. Though, at my age, perhaps it's just… the natural progression of things? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, Ms. Derasmo. Do you have any ongoing health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a bit of arthritis, in my knees, mostly. Nothing debilitating, just a bit of stiffness. And my blood pressure… it runs a little high, sometimes. My regular doctor keeps an eye on it. Other than that… I was quite healthy, all my life. I used to swim every day, you know, until… well, until recently. It takes so much energy now. I take medication for the blood pressure, a small dose. That is all, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and hypertension, managed with medication. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just a hysterectomy, many years ago. When I was… oh, goodness, in my thirties, I suppose. It was quite routine, really. No complications. And… that's all. I've been very fortunate, health-wise, until this… this feeling. I really don't like dwelling on it, Doctor. It feels… weak, to admit such things. A strong woman shouldn't be feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, feeling unwell is never a sign of weakness. It simply means something needs attention. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she suffered from terrible migraines, all her life. And my brother… he had some trouble with his nerves, anxiety, mostly. He was a very sensitive man. On my husband’s side… his mother had something with her memory, towards the end of her life. I don’t recall the specifics. It was many years ago. And… that’s all that comes to mind, truthfully. They were a large family, and I wasn’t particularly close to many of them. I hope that’s helpful. Is there anything else you require, Doctor? I truly do have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, migraines, anxiety, and some memory issues in the family. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, my daughter started me on Vitamin D, a few months ago. She said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. And… occasionally, I take a fish oil capsule. For my joints, she suggested. Other than that… no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. My mother always said… well, never mind. It’s a long story. Are we nearly finished, Doctor? I apologize for being so… verbose. I do tend to ramble when I’m flustered.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. Vitamin D and fish oil. Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've always been very careful about what I put into my body. I used to prepare all my own herbal remedies, you know. It’s a skill I’ve… let lapse, unfortunately. Now, if you’ll excuse me… perhaps we could proceed with the physical exam? I really do need to be going soon. I have a garden that is sorely neglected.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Let’s do a quick exam. It won't take long. Could you step up on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: There we are. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't weighed myself in months. It’s best not to dwell on such things, you see. I’m probably lighter than I used to be. This… feeling… it’s quite draining, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, 68 kilograms. And what is your height, Ms. Derasmo, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I used to be very precise about these things. I was quite a tall girl, you know. Let me see… I believe I’m… one meter and eighty centimeters. Or perhaps a little less now. Age does shrink one, doesn’t it? I used to be the tallest woman in the room, practically. Do we need to be exact, Doctor? It’s really not that important, is it? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Just relax and take some deep breaths.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I always find the stethoscope… unsettling. It feels so… clinical. But do as you must. I’ll try to remain as still as possible. Just get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind. This… whole process… it’s rather draining, you know.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Lung sounds are clear, though slightly diminished. Reflexes are a bit slow, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you are. Honestly, I’ve had so many doctors over the years… poking and prodding. I’ve lost count. It’s all rather… impersonal, isn’t it? Though I suppose it’s necessary. Just be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I have roses that are desperately in need of pruning. A neglected garden is a sad sight, you know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Ms. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. The low mood, loss of enjoyment, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, and weight loss… all point in that direction. It’s important to remember that this is a medical condition, just like arthritis or high blood pressure, and it's very treatable.
PATIENT: Depression… Well. That’s… not entirely unexpected, I suppose. Though I always considered myself a strong woman. I’ve faced many hardships in my life, and I’ve always persevered. To think that… this is what’s brought me low… It’s rather… disheartening. What does that mean, Doctor? What do we do about it? I haven’t the time for… wallowing, you know. I have commitments. And roses.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not a sign of weakness, Ms. Derasmo, but a chemical imbalance in the brain. It's a common condition, especially as we age. The good news is, there are several effective treatments. We can explore medication options – antidepressants can help restore that chemical balance. We can also discuss therapy, which can provide you with coping strategies and support. And lifestyle changes, like regular exercise and a healthy diet, can also make a big difference. I recommend we start with a blood test to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A blood test… very well. If it’s necessary. Though I do detest needles. And as for… medication… I’m not particularly keen on taking more pills, Doctor. I already have blood pressure medication, you see. But… I suppose I must do what is necessary to feel like myself again. Perhaps… therapy? Would that involve… talking about my feelings? Because frankly, I’m not one for… emotional displays. But… if it helps me get back to my garden… I suppose I’m willing to try. What does it involve, exactly? And how long will this… process… take? I do have a rather busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: A blood test is a good starting point, and it will help us rule out other possibilities. As for therapy, yes, it involves talking about your feelings, but it’s a safe and confidential space, and you control the pace. You don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with. There are different types of therapy, and we can find one that suits your personality. We can start with a referral to a therapist specializing in geriatric depression. They'll assess your situation and develop a treatment plan. The length of treatment varies depending on your needs, but it typically involves weekly sessions for several weeks or months. I'll write you a referral order, and I'll also order the blood test. While we wait for the results, I can also prescribe a low dose of an antidepressant to see if it helps alleviate some of your symptoms. It may take a few weeks to see the full effect. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An antidepressant… very well. If it’s a low dose. And if it doesn’t interfere with my… other medication. And… a therapist? I suppose I have no choice. Though I do hope they understand that I’m a busy woman. And… that I prefer a practical approach. No… dwelling on the past, if you please. Just solutions. Write the referrals, Doctor. And the prescription. Let us get this over with. I have roses to prune, and a garden that is desperately awaiting my attention. I trust you’ve written everything down correctly? I don’t want to have to come back unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Here are the referral order and the prescription. I’ve also included a list of local therapists who specialize in geriatric depression, along with their contact information. I’ve noted your preference for a practical approach in the referral. I’ve documented everything in your chart, including your current medications and allergies. I've also included a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you're doing. If you experience any concerning side effects from the medication, or if your symptoms worsen, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Very well. Four weeks… I shall make a note of that. And I shall contact the clinic if… anything untoward happens. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. I trust you’ve taken everything into consideration? My schedule, my preferences… I do appreciate your… assistance. Though I must confess, I’m not entirely comfortable with all of this. But… I suppose it’s necessary. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a garden to tend to. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I hope you feel better soon. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
