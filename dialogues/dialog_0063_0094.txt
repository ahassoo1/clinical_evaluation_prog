DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. So, Ms. Fontanazza, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Just… the paper said something about learning? I don't really… remember why I'm here. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about… being careful? I work with metal, you know. Sharp things. It's... important work.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Your husband contacted the clinic regarding a preventative health assessment, given your profession. Metal work, you say?
PATIENT: Right, metal. Sheet metal. It’s… dusty. And loud. Sometimes I cut myself, small things. Band-aids. Always band-aids. Is that… bad? Should I be worried about the dust? I don't really get sick though. Not usually.
DOCTOR: “Not usually” is not a particularly helpful metric, Ms. Fontanazza. We’re attempting to establish a baseline here, to ensure long-term health, not simply react to ailments after they occur. The dust is… concerning. Sheet metal can contain various particulate matter. And frequent minor injuries, even those requiring only band-aids, can introduce infection. Let’s start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh. History? I… don’t know. I had chickenpox when I was little, I think. And maybe tonsils out? A long time ago. My husband knows all that stuff. He handles… everything. I just… work. I don't remember doctors much. It's never been… serious, I guess. Are we going to check for dust in my lungs? That sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, "handling everything" isn’t a substitute for a complete medical record, Ms. Fontanazza. We will assess your respiratory function, yes. Although I doubt it will be a pleasant experience. Now, regarding family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My… my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was… thin. Always tired. And my father… he smoked. A lot. He… he’s gone now. A long time ago. I don't really know what he died of. No one really talked about it. Is… is smoking bad for your lungs too? Because of the dust? It all sounds the same, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, smoking is exceedingly detrimental to lung health, Ms. Fontanazza, and certainly exacerbates the risks associated with particulate exposure. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… don't think so. I eat everything. My husband makes sure I get enough to eat, you know? I mean, sometimes my skin gets itchy, if I’m working with… certain metals. But that’s just the metal. It’s… rough. Not an allergy. Just… metal. Is it important if it's just the metal? I don't want to make a big deal of nothing.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Fontanazza. Even "just metal." The frequency and severity of this skin irritation are pertinent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Uh… no. No pills. Sometimes I take something for a headache. Like… ibuprofen? But not often. Just when my head really hurts. My husband keeps it in the cabinet. He tells me what to take. I don't… really pay attention to the name. It’s… white. A little bottle. That’s all I know. Is that… enough information? I don't like taking pills. They make me… sleepy.
DOCTOR: "White" is insufficient, Ms. Fontanazza. Dosage and frequency are crucial. We’re attempting to create a comprehensive medical profile here, not engage in a guessing game. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please, lie back on the examination table. We will start with auscultation of your lungs.
PATIENT: Ugh. Lie down? I don’t like hospitals. Or… doctor places. Is this going to take long? My husband is expecting me back. For dinner. He makes a nice roast on Tuesdays. And… what’s “auscultation”? Does it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. It makes me nervous. Is it… cold? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: "Auscultation" simply means listening to your lungs with a stethoscope, Ms. Fontanazza. It is non-invasive and should not cause discomfort. And no, it won't be cold. It will be… brief. Please, lie down. We must establish a baseline to properly assess your respiratory health. It is a matter of preventative care.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry, okay? My roast… it gets cold. And my husband doesn't like cold roast. Is that… is that what you use? That… shiny thing? It looks… scary. And cold. Really cold.
DOCTOR: It is merely a stethoscope, Ms. Fontanazza. It amplifies sounds, it does not bite. Take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your breathing sounds somewhat… congested. I hear some wheezing, particularly on the left side. Your heart rate is also slightly elevated. Blood pressure is within normal limits, though. Now, please turn your head to the side. I need to examine your throat.
PATIENT: Congested? Wheezing? That doesn’t sound good. Is it the dust? It's always dusty at work. My husband says I should wear a mask, but they're uncomfortable. And they make it hard to… see. Are you going to stick something down my throat? I don’t like that. It makes me gag. Please be quick. And gentle. And don’t stick it too far.
DOCTOR: It’s a routine examination, Ms. Fontanazza. Your throat is slightly irritated, but no visible signs of acute infection. Given your occupation and the symptoms you’ve described – congestion, wheezing, and irritation – I suspect occupational exposure is a contributing factor. We need to order some pulmonary function tests to assess the extent of the damage. And I strongly recommend you consider wearing a properly fitted respirator at work. Now, I'll need a complete medical history. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Ugh. Again with the allergies? I told you, I don't think I have any! My husband asks me every year at the doctor and I always say no! And I’ll tell you again, I don’t! Except… sometimes my hands get itchy when I touch… certain soaps. The ones with the… flowers in them. But that’s just my hands. It’s not a real allergy! It’s just… soap! And it doesn’t happen all the time. Only the flowery ones. Is that… is that important? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I just want to know if my lungs are okay.
DOCTOR: “Ridiculous,” Ms. Fontanazza?
