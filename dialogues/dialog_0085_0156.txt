DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Lahn, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, really. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent, you know? I think it might be something to do with… I’ve had some stomach issues before, I think. But honestly, I can’t really remember exactly what.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It is good to figure out what's going on, especially if it's been bothering you for a while. When you say "a bit now," could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe a couple of weeks? Possibly longer? Everything feels a little blurry, to be honest. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been more frequent lately. I’m really not great with dates, sorry!
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, dates can be tricky. A couple of weeks, or possibly longer, and more frequent lately—that gives me a starting point. And when you say it comes and goes, can you describe what a typical "episode" looks like?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… well, usually it starts with just a little bit of cramping, low down. Not super painful, just uncomfortable. Then I need to go to the bathroom, pretty urgently. And then… well, you know. It’s… watery. A lot. And it happens a few times a day when it’s bad. Sometimes it’s just once, but other times it’s like… every couple of hours. It’s really tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite disruptive and tiring, and it’s good you’re recognizing that. Are you noticing anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don't know if there's anything specific. I think maybe certain foods? Like… dairy sometimes feels… off. But it's not always. And I’ve been trying to eat pretty normally, so I'm not sure. It’s hard to pinpoint. I’ve also been a bit stressed lately, with work and everything, but I don't know if that's connected. Honestly, I’m just grasping at straws here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially dairy and perhaps stress. Those are good things to consider. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced anything besides the diarrhea – like nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain that’s more than just cramping, or noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Let me see… no vomiting, thankfully. No fever either. The cramping is pretty much it, pain-wise. But… … I think I might have seen a little bit of blood once or twice? It wasn't a lot, and it was a while ago, so I wasn't sure if I was imagining things. It just scared me a bit, so I tried not to look too closely. It hasn't happened recently, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, even though it’s unsettling to talk about. Seeing blood, even a small amount, is something we need to take seriously, so it's good you mentioned it. The fact that it hasn’t happened recently is helpful, but we’ll still want to investigate. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um, no, not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything, ever. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, I think, but I don't really remember. And I don’t take any regular medications. Just… over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like pain relievers for headaches. Nothing specific or ongoing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any previous illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had tonsillitis when I was a kid, and I think I had chickenpox. But nothing major. No surgeries, definitely. Oh! And… … I think I was diagnosed with something a few years ago, with my stomach? Something about… inflammation? Or something like that? But it was a long time ago, and I don't really remember the details. It’s all a bit hazy. They did a lot of tests, and I had to change my diet for a while, but… honestly, I'm struggling to recall what it was exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, even if it’s hazy. It sounds like there might be a prior gastrointestinal issue. We can look into your records to see if we can find more details on that diagnosis. Let's move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: My… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had stomach problems for years. I think it was something chronic. She was always complaining about her tummy. And… my uncle, he was diagnosed with something similar a few years ago. I think it was celiac disease? But I’m not 100% sure. Everyone always just talked about “stomach issues,” so it was hard to keep track. No one really explained things properly, you know? Everyone just suffered in silence.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when things aren't clearly communicated. A family history of stomach problems in your grandmother and potential celiac disease in your uncle are important things to note. Okay, and finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don't smoke at all. I hardly ever drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion. And I definitely don't use any drugs. I’m married, and my husband wouldn’t allow it! I try to live a pretty healthy life, all things considered. I work a lot, so I don’t have much time for anything else, but I try to eat well and get enough sleep when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Healthy lifestyle with no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my stomach. It’s been really bothering me, and I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. . I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. . …Okay, bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, though they are slightly hyperactive. . I’m going to press gently here. . …There is mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. . Okay, that's all for the physical exam right now. Based on your symptoms, family history, and the physical exam, it's possible we're dealing with a flare-up of a pre-existing gastrointestinal condition, possibly inflammatory bowel disease, or potentially something new. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I want to know what’s going on, so whatever tests you think are necessary, please do them. I’m just tired of feeling sick all the time. I’m happy to do anything to get some answers. What kind of tests are you thinking?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand your frustration. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall organ function, a stool culture to rule out any bacterial infections, and a stool test for occult blood to confirm if there's any bleeding in your digestive tract. I’m also going to order a Celiac’s panel, given your family history. Finally, because of the family history and your persistent symptoms, I'd like to schedule a colonoscopy. It's the best way to visualize your entire colon and identify any abnormalities. It will require some preparation beforehand, but it will give us the most definitive answers. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s a lot of tests! A colonoscopy sounds… scary. What exactly does that involve? And what will the preparation be like? I’m not really good with medical procedures, to be honest. I get a bit anxious. And what if the tests show something serious? I just want to know what I’m dealing with, but I’m also a bit scared of the results.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of tests, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious. I'm glad you're asking questions, and I want to assure you I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. Let's start with the colonoscopy. It involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It’s usually done with sedation, so you'll be comfortable and won’t feel any pain. The preparation involves a special diet for a day or two before the procedure and taking a laxative to clear your colon completely. It’s not pleasant, but it’s essential for a clear view. As for the results, it’s true that they could show something serious, like inflammation or polyps. But even if that’s the case, early detection is key. Polyps can often be removed during the colonoscopy itself, and inflammation can be managed with medication. We will discuss the results thoroughly and create a treatment plan together. It's important to remember that we're doing these tests to get answers and take the best possible care of you. Do you want me to go into more detail about any of the tests, or would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of the colonoscopy in more detail?
PATIENT: I think… maybe explaining the risks and benefits of the colonoscopy would be good. That might help me feel a bit less anxious. And what about the other tests? Will I need to fast for those? Or are there any other special instructions? I just want to be prepared, you know? It’s just a bit overwhelming, trying to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be fully prepared, and I'm happy to go over everything with you in detail. Let's start with the colonoscopy. The main risk is a small chance of perforation – a tear in the colon wall – but this is very rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases. There’s also a small risk of bleeding, particularly if polyps are removed. However, we take precautions to minimize these risks, and we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure. Common side effects include bloating, gas, and mild abdominal discomfort, which usually resolve within a day or two. As for the benefits, a colonoscopy can detect and remove precancerous polyps, preventing colon cancer. It can also diagnose the cause of unexplained abdominal pain or bleeding. Now, regarding the other tests, yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests. You can still drink clear liquids, like water or broth. The stool tests don't require any special preparation – just collect the samples as instructed. I’ll give you detailed instructions for each test before you leave. Do you have any other questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay. That makes sense. So, fasting for the blood tests, and the stool tests are straightforward. I think… I'm still a little worried about the colonoscopy, but I understand it’s important. And it sounds like you take a lot of precautions. When would I have the colonoscopy scheduled? And how long would I need to take off work? I work pretty long hours, and it's hard to get time off. Also, will I need someone to drive me home after the procedure?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It's okay to be worried, and I’m glad you're asking these important questions. We can schedule the colonoscopy within the next two weeks, depending on availability at the endoscopy center. We'll need to arrange it with the center directly. You will need to take the entire day off work for the colonoscopy, as you will be sedated. It’s essential to have someone drive you home, as you won’t be able to drive yourself. The sedation can take several hours to wear off, and you’ll want someone to monitor you. I’ll also give you detailed pre- and post-procedure instructions, including dietary guidelines and potential side effects to watch out for. Before we finish, are there any other questions I can answer for you or anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. You’ve explained everything really clearly, and I feel a lot better about it now. I'm still a bit nervous, but I feel like I know what to expect. I’ll schedule the colonoscopy as soon as I can, and I’ll make sure to arrange a ride. Thank you again for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before the procedure. I’ll have the lab requisitions and stool collection kits ready for you before you leave. And I’ll give you a summary of our discussion, including the list of tests and the instructions for the colonoscopy. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon. .
PATIENT: .
