DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you, Doctor. Please, call me Nicoletta. Well, to be honest, I feel like I need a little… a little oomph, you know? A fresh start. I’m eighty-seven years young, and things just aren’t working like they used to. I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of a jumpstart, a reset, to feeling better.
DOCTOR: “Oomph,” alright. Well, “oomph” is… vague. And at eighty-seven, some slowing down is perfectly normal, you understand. But we can certainly explore things. Let’s try to be a little more specific. What exactly isn’t working like it used to?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, slowing down is natural. My husband, bless his soul, always said that. But it’s more than just slowing down, Doctor. It’s… energy. I used to be quite active, always gardening, going to church socials, visiting friends. Now, I find myself tired just thinking about those things. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. Little things, you know? Forgetting names, where I put my glasses… though I seem to have those right now! It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue and memory issues. Common complaints, frankly. And often linked. Now, let’s try to pinpoint this fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I think. Not a crushing tiredness, you understand. More like… a low hum of exhaustion. It’s there all day, really. Some days are better than others, certainly. But even on a “good” day, I don’t have the pep I used to. It makes me sad, Doctor. I want to enjoy my life, but it's hard when you’re always feeling… blah.
DOCTOR: “Blah,” yes. Well, let’s rule out some of the obvious things. Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not much change, really. I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables… my daughter always makes sure of that. She worries about me, you see. I still enjoy my arroz rojo, of course. And a little chicken kelaguen now and then. But nothing drastic has changed. I haven't been trying any new diets or anything like that. Perhaps a little less, as I don't have the appetite I used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, decreased appetite and fatigue. Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see. I take a blood pressure medication… lisinopril, I believe. And something for my arthritis… naproxen. Just as needed, though, when my joints are acting up. And a daily vitamin. Nothing fancy, just a standard multivitamin. My daughter insists on that one too! She’s a good girl, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril, naproxen as needed, and a multivitamin. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. That's a good question. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. My husband, he was allergic to penicillin, terribly so. But I’ve never had a problem with any medications myself. I did have a bit of an upset stomach once with some sort of antibiotic when I was a young woman, but that was a long time ago. I suppose that doesn’t really count as an allergy, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a minor stomach upset probably doesn’t count. Alright. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides arthritis and high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had pneumonia when I was quite young, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… nothing major, that I recall. The usual aches and pains of getting older, of course, but nothing a doctor ever formally diagnosed. My husband always took care of me when I was feeling under the weather. He knew just what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and high blood pressure and arthritis currently. And you said your husband is… deceased?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Bless his soul, he passed away five years ago. It was… hard. He was a good man, a very good man. But we mustn’t dwell on the past, must we? He'd want me to be happy and healthy. That’s what he always said. So, I'm trying my best. Though, as I said, I could use a little oomph to get there.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen… standard things. Then we can discuss some possible blood work to rule out some common causes of fatigue, like anemia or thyroid issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not terribly concerning. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though she does seem to have slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No masses or organomegaly. Alright, everything seems relatively normal so far, but the diminished breath sounds and tenderness are worth investigating further. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also want to check a Vitamin D level. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor. Yes, that sounds perfectly good to me. Whatever you think is necessary to get to the bottom of things. I appreciate you taking such good care of me already. It's nice to know someone is listening. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast before the blood draw?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. Nothing to eat or drink except water. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to get them back to us. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—particularly shortness of breath or severe abdominal pain—please contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Fast for eight hours, nothing but water. And contact the office if anything gets worse. Shortness of breath or severe abdominal pain. Three to five business days for the results, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up. Thank you very much. You’ve put my mind at ease already. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No, no specific foods to avoid at this point. Just try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as you can. Honestly, with your fatigue, probably don't overexert yourself. And try not to worry too much. The blood work will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything beautifully. You’ve been very patient and thorough, and I truly appreciate it. I’m just glad I came in. It's good to know I'm being taken care of. Though… perhaps just one small question. Do you think it’s possible this is just… age? That I’m simply getting older, and my body is slowing down? It’s a silly question, I’m sure. But it’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Well, Nicoletta, some slowing down is natural with age. But fatigue and memory issues aren't simply something you have to accept. There are many treatable causes, and we’re going to rule those out first. To simply attribute it to "age" without investigation would be… irresponsible. We'll get your blood work back and take it from there. Now, the nurse will come in shortly to go over the lab requisition and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any transportation arranged?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank you. My daughter is picking me up. She’s very good about that, always making sure I have a ride. And you're right, of course. It’s best to rule things out. I just… I suppose I worry sometimes. It's silly. But thank you again, Doctor Havird. You’ve given me a lot of peace of mind. I’m glad I came to see you. I won’t keep you. I’m sure you have other patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Nicoletta. And try not to worry. We'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You too. .
