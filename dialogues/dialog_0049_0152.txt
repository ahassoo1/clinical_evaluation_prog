DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. It was a little high on the blood test, she said. I don’t really understand what that means high, though. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Well, “high” is relative, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is! Everything is, I suppose. I just… I feel fine. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. I try to, anyway. So I was surprised to hear it was up. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Worry is…unproductive. Let’s just get the numbers, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Numbers are good. I remember them well. What were the numbers, exactly? I have a good memory for details, but not so much for what people tell me, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see... Total cholesterol was 245. Your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160. HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40. And your triglycerides are 180. Do those numbers mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, those numbers… they sound familiar now that I hear them again. The nurse did say something about good and bad ones. So, 245 is the overall number? And 160 is the one I need to worry about? Is 40 for the good one… low? I think I remember her saying something about wanting that higher.
DOCTOR: “Worry” isn’t helpful. Yes, 40 is…suboptimal for HDL. Ideally, we’d like to see that above 60. The LDL is also elevated. It puts you at a slightly increased risk. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My father… he had some heart problems later in life, I believe. Not a heart attack, exactly, but… something with his arteries getting blocked. He needed a procedure, a long time ago. And my mother, she had high blood pressure. Does that count? I always remember my grandmother saying heart trouble “ran in the family,” but she said a lot of things.
DOCTOR: “Ran in the family” isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Geho. We need facts. So, arterial blockage in your father, hypertension in your mother. Any siblings with similar issues?
PATIENT: No, I’m an only child, I’m afraid. Always have been. I do have… well, I have a cousin, but we weren’t close. I haven't seen him in years, and I don’t know anything about his health. Sorry, I wish I had more information. It’s just… I don’t really keep track of things like that with family I don't see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! Well, “regularly” might be a strong word. I walk most days, though. I live near the park, so I try to walk at least 30 minutes. Sometimes longer, if the weather is nice. And I do some gardening, which I consider exercise, too. It's a lot of bending and lifting, you know.
DOCTOR: Gardening… Adequate, I suppose. What about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet… I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I cook most of my meals at home. I do like my cheese, though. And a little bit of chocolate. Dark chocolate, of course. That’s good for you, isn’t it? I also have a weakness for pastries. Not every day, mind you! Mostly on weekends.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” isn’t a plan, Ms. Geho. And dark chocolate, while preferable, is still…chocolate. Let’s perform a brief physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, of course. A physical exam. That makes sense. Should I… change clothes? Or is it just listening to my heart and stuff? I always forget what happens during these things.
DOCTOR: No need for a change of clothes. Just your pulse and blood pressure, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Not alarming, but something to note. Lungs are clear. Now, have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. Not at all. I feel perfectly fine, really. Sometimes a little tired, but that’s just from gardening, I think. I do a lot of digging. And… well, I’m not getting any younger, am I? No chest pain, though. Definitely no shortness of breath. And my ankles seem fine. I haven’t noticed any swelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history, physical exam, and lab results, it appears you have mild hypercholesterolemia and borderline hypertension. We need to address this to minimize your risk of cardiovascular events. This isn’t an immediate crisis, but it requires intervention.
PATIENT: Oh. “Intervention.” That sounds… serious. What kind of intervention? Are you talking about medication? Because I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I always worry about side effects. Is there anything else we can try first? Like… changing my diet more? Or doing more exercise?
DOCTOR: Diet and exercise are always recommended, Ms. Geho. But at your age and with your numbers, lifestyle modifications alone may not be sufficient. We're discussing a low-dose statin. It's a common medication, and the benefits typically outweigh the risks. I can explain the potential side effects, but they are generally mild. We will monitor your liver enzymes regularly. Alternatively, we could repeat the cholesterol panel in three months to reassess, but frankly, that delays necessary treatment.
PATIENT: Three months… that does sound like a long time to wait, if it’s something serious. And… liver enzymes? That doesn’t sound good. If it’s a low dose, and you’re monitoring me, maybe… maybe we could try the medication? But I’d like to know exactly what the side effects are. Everything you can tell me. And what happens if… if they do happen?
DOCTOR: Very well. The most common side effects are muscle aches and pains, fatigue, and digestive upset. Less common, but more serious, are liver enzyme elevations and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis – a breakdown of muscle tissue. We will be monitoring your liver enzymes with blood tests. If you experience severe muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine, you must contact me immediately. We will start with a low dose of atorvastatin, 10mg daily. We’ll recheck your cholesterol in three months to assess effectiveness and tolerance. I’m also recommending you continue with a heart-healthy diet – low in saturated and trans fats, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains – and regular exercise, at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Atorvastatin, 10mg. Muscle aches, liver… dark urine. And keep eating healthy and exercising. Three months to check it. Does it interact with anything? I take a little bit of something for my… well, just a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low last winter. Will that cause a problem? And… can I still have my cheese?
DOCTOR: Vitamin D is unlikely to interact significantly. As for the cheese… moderation, Ms. Geho. Everything in moderation. I’m writing a prescription for the atorvastatin and a lab order for a lipid panel and liver function tests. Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I'm still a bit worried, but… I feel better knowing we have a plan. I'll schedule that follow-up appointment right away. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Ms. Geho. And try to adhere to the recommendations.
