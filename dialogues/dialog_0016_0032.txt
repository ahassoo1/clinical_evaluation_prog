DOCTOR: Hello Mr. Krok, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Maskal, is it? Yes, well. It’s… a delicate matter. A most unpleasant matter, frankly. My wife insisted I come. She’s always fussing. Something… is leaking. Down there. It's been going on for a bit, now. I can't say exactly how long, you understand. Old age does things to one's memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some incontinence, or leakage, and you've noticed it's been happening for a while. That's perfectly alright to discuss, and very common, especially with age. We'll get to the bottom of this. When you say "a bit," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: "Rough estimate"? Doctor, I haven’t kept a calendar of my… discharges. Perhaps a month? Maybe two? It’s difficult to say. It’s not… constant, you understand. Just… there, sometimes. And it’s… not pleasant. It causes a bit of… odor, too, my wife tells me. She has a very sensitive nose. Honestly, I’d rather not dwell on the specifics. Is there not a… solution? Something to simply stop it?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's alright if you’re not comfortable with specifics, and it's good your wife is helping to keep track of things. We definitely want to find a solution to help you feel more comfortable. To get a better idea of what might be causing this, could you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens? Well… it seems to be more frequent when I’ve been… active. Working on the tractors, mostly. Or… after. Though, I must say, it’s occurred at other times too. Just… unexpectedly. It's quite embarrassing, you understand. I'm not a young man anymore. These things shouldn’t be happening. Is it… something serious? My wife keeps talking about infections. Is that it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse with activity, particularly after working on the tractors, and can happen at other times too. That's helpful information. It's good your wife is thinking about infections, that’s certainly something we need to rule out. Besides the leakage and odor, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than the… unpleasantness? Well… there's a bit of… burning, sometimes. When I… urinate. Not always, mind you. And it's not severe, just… noticeable. And… I suppose a little soreness. Down there. It's hard to describe, Doctor. It feels… irritated. Honestly, I've been trying to ignore it. An old man gets used to a few aches and pains, you know. It's just… this is rather… inconvenient. And my wife… well, she’s quite persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing some burning with urination and a bit of soreness down there, but it’s not constant. I appreciate you telling me all of this, even if it’s difficult to talk about. It’s important information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me understand what's going on and rule out any obvious causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, I’m an old man. I’ve had doctors poke and prod before. It's… not a pleasant prospect, but if it’s necessary… I suppose. Just… please be quick about it. And discreet. I haven’t the energy for… complications. I trust you're a professional, of course. But still… one's dignity, you understand. Do you require… any specific preparation?
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand and respect your concerns about your dignity. I assure you, I'll be as quick and discreet as possible. No specific preparation is needed. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be great. I'll start with listening to your abdomen and then do a quick external examination. We'll likely need a urine sample as well, to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A urine sample, of course. Always a urine sample. Honestly, the indignity of it all… Just… try to be gentle, Doctor. I haven’t the flexibility I once had. And please, do hurry. My wife is waiting, and she gets rather… impatient when I’m kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and we’ll go as quickly as we can. Okay, Mr. Krok, your abdomen sounds clear. During the external examination, I notice some mild tenderness in the suprapubic area – that's right above your pubic bone. There doesn't appear to be any significant swelling or masses. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. Now, could you please provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: Enlarged prostate, you say? Of course. What isn't enlarged at my age? Everything is falling apart, Doctor. Everything. Is that… where I’m to go? To… provide the sample? Honestly, the whole situation is quite… trying. I hope there's a comfortable place to sit. An old man needs his comforts, you know. Just… point me in the right direction, and I’ll be as quick as I can. But don't expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the restroom, Mr. Krok. There is a comfortable place to sit, and take your time. I’ll be right here when you're finished. Just let me know when you've collected a sample.
PATIENT: There. Finally. Honestly, Doctor, the things one has to endure… I trust you won't keep me waiting long for the results? My wife is a very… inquisitive woman, and she won’t be pleased if I’m kept away for too long. Now, what did this… ordeal reveal? Is it something serious? Is it contagious? I must know!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. Let's see what the results tell us… Okay, the urine analysis shows some white blood cells and bacteria present. This indicates a urinary tract infection, or UTI. It explains the burning sensation you've been experiencing, and the odor you mentioned. It's not contagious. It’s common in older adults, and thankfully, it’s usually treatable with antibiotics. The prostate enlargement isn't directly related to the infection, but it can sometimes make it harder to completely empty your bladder, which can contribute to UTIs. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: A… urinary tract infection. So, it’s not… something dreadful? Just… bacteria? And antibiotics will… eliminate it? That sounds… manageable. My wife always said I needed to drink more water. Perhaps she was right, for once. The prostate… you said it can make it harder to empty the bladder? Will I need… treatment for that as well? I'm not keen on further… procedures, Doctor. Honestly, I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. Is there a… medication for that? Something simple? I just want this all to be over with.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Krok, a UTI is very treatable. It's not life-threatening, but it's important to address it to prevent it from getting worse. Regarding your prostate, you're right to be concerned about further procedures. Many men with prostate enlargement can manage it with medication. There are medications called alpha-blockers that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. There are also other medications that can shrink the prostate over time, but those often have more side effects. We can start with an alpha-blocker and see how you respond. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a urologist for a more detailed evaluation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: An… alpha-blocker. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Something simple, as you said. No further… intrusions, if possible. And no side effects, I hope? My wife always complains about my… medications. She says they make me… grumpy. So, you'll prescribe me this… alpha-blocker? And I just… take it as directed? And drink more water, of course. My wife will be pleased to hear that. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your… patience. I'm not the easiest of patients, I'll admit. But I'm grateful you didn't resort to… drastic measures. Now, let’s just hope this… medication works. And quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. You're a perfectly reasonable patient, and I understand your concerns completely. Yes, I'm going to prescribe you Tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker. The usual dose is 0.4mg once daily. It's best taken at the same time each day, ideally with a meal. Possible side effects can include dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when standing up quickly. Some men experience a stuffy nose or a decrease in ejaculate volume. If you experience any significant side effects, please let me know right away. I'm also going to recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water per day, and I’ll send a reminder to follow up with me in two weeks to check on your progress. Here's the prescription for Tamsulosin, and a handout with information about UTIs and managing your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Tamsulosin… eight glasses of water… Yes, I believe that covers most of it. No, I don’t think so. Unless… will this… medication interact with my blood pressure pills? I take those every morning, as well. And… is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking while taking this? My wife is a very… particular cook, and she won't take kindly to me questioning her recipes. Other than that, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been… most helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go appease my wife. She’s likely wondering where I’ve been.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Yes, Tamsulosin can sometimes lower your blood pressure, so it’s important to be aware of that. It’s generally safe to take with most blood pressure medications, but you should monitor your blood pressure closely, especially when you first start taking it. If you experience dizziness or lightheadedness, let me know. As for food or drink restrictions, there are no specific restrictions with Tamsulosin. You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could help. I hope you feel better soon, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and give your wife my best!
