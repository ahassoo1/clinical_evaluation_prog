DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero, and I’m a family medicine physician here. It’s August 2nd. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having trouble… emptying my bladder completely. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s… bothersome. I don’t know how to explain it better than that, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly alright to describe it as “bothersome.” Many things can cause difficulty with complete bladder emptying. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That’s a good question. I suppose… maybe three, four months ago? It came on slowly, I didn’t notice right away. At first, I just thought I was getting old, you know? But it’s not getting better, and now it’s… well, it’s a worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's definitely worth investigating. And it’s good you noticed it wasn't improving. Could you describe what it feels like when you try to urinate?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like I can go, and I do go, but… not all of it. Like there’s still some left in there, even after I’ve tried. It’s not painful, not exactly. Just… incomplete. And sometimes, it takes me a little while to… start. I have to… push a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it feels like you’re not fully emptying, no pain, and you've noticed some hesitancy starting the stream and perhaps a need to strain. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I do get up a couple of times at night to go. More than I used to, maybe. And… now that you mention it… sometimes I feel like I have to go right away. Like I can’t wait, you know? It’s not every time, but it’s happened a few times.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased frequency, especially at night, and some urgency – the feeling like you need to go right away. That gives me a bit more information. Do you have any trouble with the stream itself?
PATIENT: Trouble with the stream… what do you mean? Like… is it weak? No, it's not weak, exactly. It's… normal, I suppose. But sometimes it stops and starts. Not all the time, but it happens. Like it catches.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent stream – stopping and starting. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's move on to some more general questions. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any history of neurological problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I stopped taking them a few years back, he said it was okay. Other than that… no, not really. No diabetes, no trouble with my nerves or anything like that. I used to be pretty healthy, worked hard all my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of controlled high blood pressure, now off medication. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago now. And… I broke my leg once, when I was working on the boat. That required a hospital stay, but other than that… no, nothing major. I’ve been lucky, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken leg in the past. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. Penicillin, aspirin… doesn’t bother me none.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my aches and pains, but that’s about it. Nothing for my bladder or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do any of your family members have any problems with their bladder or kidneys, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That's a tough one, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about health things. My father, he was a strong man, never complained about anything. My mother… I don't remember her being sick much. I don’t really know if anyone had trouble with their bladder or anything like that. We just weren’t the talking kind, you know? Mostly, we talked about fishing and work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes family medical history isn’t readily available. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, my wife passed away a few years back. I keep busy, try to. I like to fish, when the weather is good. And I do some work around the house, keep the place tidy. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. And I don’t smoke. I used to, a long time ago, but I quit. Mostly, I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hilber. That gives me a good overall picture. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Doctor, I… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? What will you be looking for? I’m not comfortable with that, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s a very common concern. A digital rectal exam is important because it allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate gland, which can often contribute to urinary symptoms like the ones you’re experiencing. It also helps rule out any abnormalities. It's a quick examination, and I will explain everything as I go, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. It’s a standard part of evaluating these types of symptoms. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with it, we can proceed with other tests, but the information we gain from the exam is quite valuable. Would you like me to explain the other tests we could consider?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t like the sound of it, Doctor. But I want to get to the bottom of this, you know? If it’s important, I suppose… I suppose I can try it. But please, explain everything as you go. And tell me if it’s going to hurt. I really don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, I appreciate you being willing to proceed. I will absolutely explain everything beforehand and stop if you experience any discomfort. I will also let you know when I’m starting and finishing. First, I’m going to have you lie on your side with your knees bent. Then I’ll gently insert a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. I'll be feeling the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It may feel like you have the urge to urinate, but it shouldn't be painful. It takes just a moment or two. Are you ready for me to begin?
PATIENT: Yes… I suppose so. Just… take it easy, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. I’m going to have you lie on your left side now with your knees bent up towards your chest. That will help relax the muscles. I'm going to apply some lubrication now. This will help make the exam more comfortable. Okay, I’m just gently inserting my finger now. You might feel some pressure, and you may have the urge to urinate. Just relax as much as possible. I'm feeling your rectum and your prostate gland. Your prostate feels… slightly enlarged. The texture isn’t completely smooth, it feels a little… firm. There are no obvious nodules or masses that I can feel. Okay, that’s all done. How did that feel for you?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn’t exactly pleasant, either. I did feel the urge to go, like you said. And it did feel a little… strange. But I got through it. What does "slightly enlarged" mean, exactly? And what about the "firm" texture? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: I'm glad it wasn't too bad, Mr. Hilber. It's a very common feeling to have that urge, and I appreciate you getting through it. "Slightly enlarged" means your prostate gland is a bit bigger than what's typical for your age. As men get older, the prostate tends to grow. A firm texture can be normal, but it can also be a sign of some inflammation or changes to the gland. It's not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and to look at the cells in your urine. I also recommend a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. This test measures the level of PSA in your blood, which is a protein produced by the prostate gland. It can help us assess whether further investigation is needed. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A urine test and a blood test… yes, that sounds sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of this. What exactly will the blood test tell us? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting around, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. Waiting can be difficult. The PSA blood test can help us determine if your prostate is enlarged because of a benign condition like benign prostatic hyperplasia – a non-cancerous enlargement – or if there's a possibility of prostate cancer. It's not a definitive test for cancer, but it gives us important information. If the PSA level is elevated, we might recommend further tests like a transrectal ultrasound or a prostate biopsy. The urine test results usually come back within a day or two. The PSA blood test typically takes 3-5 business days to get the results back. I'll call you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them together. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids to help flush out your system. We'll also want to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any fever, chills, pain in your back or sides, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That all makes sense. Drinking more water, keep an eye on things, and wait for the test results. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the PSA test and collect a urine sample. She’ll give you instructions on how to do that. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
