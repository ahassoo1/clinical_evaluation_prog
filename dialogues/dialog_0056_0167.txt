DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot... it’s been hurting. Real bad, actually. It’s got a sore on it that won’t go away. It’s a problem, this one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I think it started maybe a month ago? Small thing at first, I didn't pay much attention. But it got bigger, and now it hurts to walk. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. Red and… kinda deep, you know? Not a scratch. More like a hole. It’s been worrying me. I have… the sugar sickness, the doctor told me a long time ago. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, started small, now it’s red, deep, and painful, especially when you walk. And you have diabetes – that’s important information, thank you for telling me. Diabetes can definitely affect healing, so it’s good we’re considering that. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, I see your diabetes diagnosis. Have you been keeping up with your blood sugar checks?
PATIENT: Eh… sometimes. I try, Doctor, I really do. But I forget sometimes. Old age, you know? I have my daughter, Leilani, she reminds me. She’s a good girl. But I don’t always do what she tells me. It’s hard to remember all the things. And I don't like poking my finger all the time. Does that matter much? Is that why my foot is bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Emiliano. It can be difficult to keep up with everything. And yes, keeping your blood sugar under control is really important for healing, especially with a sore like this. High blood sugar can make it harder for your body to fight infection and repair tissue. Okay, let’s take a closer look at your foot. Could you please take a seat and take off your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. There it is. Hurts just looking at it, almost. It's not getting any better, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It’s about… one and a half centimeters in diameter, looks quite deep, and there’s some redness around the edges. Is it painful to the touch here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Very painful. Ouch! Easy now, easy. Feels like… a fire, almost. It throbs too, even when I’m not walking. It’s been like that for a week or so, this throbbing. It keeps me awake at night. Is this… bad? Is it infected? My cousin, he had something like this and… well, he lost his leg. I don't want that to happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern, Emiliano, and it’s good you’re bringing this up. Given your diabetes, the throbbing, and the redness, there is a possibility of infection. We need to take this seriously. To be sure, I’m going to need to do a quick test to see if there's an infection present. It involves taking a small sample from the sore – a swab – to send to the lab. It shouldn’t be too painful, but let me know if it bothers you at any point. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A swab? Like… taking a little bit of the sore? That doesn’t sound too bad, I suppose. But will it hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I don’t like waiting, Doctor. I just want this fixed. My wife… my late wife, she always took care of things like this. I’m not very good at all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick swab, Emiliano, just a little sample to send to the lab. It might sting for a moment, but it shouldn't be very painful. And I understand not liking to wait. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend keeping all weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you can use?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have a cane or a walker. I mostly just try to walk slowly, you know? And I try to stay off it when it hurts too much. My daughter, Leilani, she says I should get one, but I’m stubborn. I don’t want to look old! But… maybe I should. If it helps the foot, I guess. What about… bandages? Can I just put a bandage on it? That always helped my scrapes when I was a boy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bandage is a good start, but given your diabetes, we need to be careful about what we use. We want to keep it clean and protected, but a regular bandage might not be enough. I’m going to apply a special dressing that will help keep the wound moist and promote healing, and also help prevent infection. It also has some antibiotic in it. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics, just in case there is an infection. It’s better to be safe. And I strongly recommend Leilani help you get a cane or walker – even for short distances. We need to protect that foot. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. Antibiotics… and the special bandage. I will ask Leilani about the cane. She will probably yell at me for not doing it sooner! So… I take the pills and put on the bandage? And then I wait for the lab results? It’s a lot to remember. Can you write it all down for me? I always forget things. And… how often do I change the bandage? And what if it gets wet? I like to swim sometimes, you know? Not much anymore, but…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emiliano. Here’s everything written down. The antibiotics are twice a day with food for seven days. Change the bandage daily, or if it gets wet or dirty. If it does get wet, change it immediately. And unfortunately, you'll need to avoid swimming until the wound is fully healed. It’s important to keep it dry to prevent infection. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three days to check on your progress and review the lab results. In the meantime, if you notice any redness spreading, increased pain, fever, or pus draining from the wound, please contact the clinic immediately, even if it's after hours. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Three days… yes, I can remember that. And no swimming… that’s a shame. But my foot is more important. Pus… what does that look like, Doctor? I don’t want to be worrying over nothing. And… my daughter can help me with the bandage. She’s good at things like that. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. Pus would look like thick, yellowish or greenish fluid. It often has an unpleasant odor. But let’s focus on keeping it clean and dry, and we’ll check on it in three days. Okay, here’s that follow-up appointment card. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. And remember, Leilani can help you with everything. Have a good day, Emiliano, and please take care of that foot.
