DOCTOR: Well, hello Marialena. I’m Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Havird. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing a rather… persistent pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Right. Pressure, you say. “A little while” is… vague, unfortunately. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies. You are quite right to ask for specifics. Let me think… It began, I believe, around the end of May, perhaps the first week of June. So, roughly six to eight weeks now. It’s not constant, but it’s… frequent, and it’s starting to disrupt my sleep a bit. I find myself needing to go to the restroom more often, even when I don’t feel a strong urge.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, starting May-June. More frequent urination, even without a strong urge. And it’s affecting your sleep. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or burning. It’s purely the pressure, a feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. It’s… uncomfortable, more than anything. And a little worrying, to be honest. I don’t recall anything specific that started it, no injury or illness that preceded it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No pain, no burning, just pressure. And no obvious trigger. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me consider… No, I haven’t noticed a change in color, or… smell, for that matter. It seems normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t seen any blood, thankfully. It’s just this persistent… sensation. I am a little concerned it might be related to something I'm drinking, but I haven't been able to pinpoint anything specific. I try to drink plenty of water, you see.
DOCTOR: Plenty of water… Right. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, though I attributed that to work. I am a graphic designer, and deadlines can be… demanding. No fever, no chills, no back pain. I suppose just the fatigue, and the worry, truthfully. It’s just… unsettling, this constant pressure. And it is impacting my concentration at work, which is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and concentration issues... Alright. Let’s move on to some general medical history. Any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, a common cold here and there, but nothing major. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which my family doctor monitors. I take a low dose medication for it, Lisinopril, I believe. Other than that, I’m generally quite healthy, or I was, until this started. I have Medicare, and I see Dr. Ramirez for my general check-ups.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… Okay. Any surgeries, hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and I’ve thankfully never been hospitalized. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was many years ago, and it was a routine procedure. Nothing since then. I try to stay active, eat a balanced diet… I really prioritize my health. This is why I'm so perplexed by this ongoing issue. It doesn't feel like anything I've done, or haven't done, caused it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any major medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother had diabetes, type 2, and she also struggled with kidney problems later in life. My father had high cholesterol, and heart disease. I try to be mindful of those predispositions, which is why I watch my diet and exercise. My sister is healthy, thankfully, as far as I know. That's the immediate family, at least. I believe my grandparents on both sides had arthritis, but nothing else stands out, specifically.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. No reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past, including the Lisinopril. No food allergies, no environmental allergies… I'm quite fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most things, which is helpful. Is that all of the questions, Doctor? I feel like I’ve been quite thorough, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll need a urine sample. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand it's standard. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I'll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a seat on the exam table. And I'll get you a cup for the sample. The restroom is just over there. Once you’ve collected it, bring it straight back to me. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will do my best to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… Send this to the lab. Okay. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope… just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am breathing normally. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything differently. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sounds… normal. No obvious abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, not tender to the touch. I'm going to palpate your lower abdomen now… just tell me if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just a… slight pressure, which is what I've been experiencing. It doesn’t worsen with the touch, thankfully. It’s… a constant sensation, rather than a sharp discomfort. I hope that clarifies things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, based on this preliminary examination, it could be a number of things. It's likely a mild urinary tract irritation, or possibly a bladder spasm. It’s not unusual, especially if you’re… prone to worry. We’ll need to wait for the lab results to rule out an infection. But for now, I recommend drinking even more water, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. And try to relax. Seriously.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. While I appreciate your reassurance, I am rather diligent about my fluid intake, and I generally avoid caffeine and alcohol. I suppose I do tend to overthink things, but I assure you, this pressure is quite real. I'm relieved you’re running tests to rule out an infection. When should I expect to hear back from the lab? And what if the tests do indicate an infection? What's the typical course of treatment in that scenario?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. If it is an infection, we'll prescribe antibiotics. It’s straightforward. But honestly, I suspect it’s just stress. And your age. Things change. But we’ll see what the tests say. I’ll have my assistant call you with the results. Don't worry too much. And try to get some rest.
PATIENT: I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and attention. I will await the results, and I will certainly try to rest. If I don't hear back within 48 hours, may I please have the number for the office? And is there anything specific I should be looking for in the meantime—any worsening of symptoms that would warrant a call sooner?
DOCTOR: Here. If you develop a fever, or severe pain, call. Otherwise, just wait for the results. You’re free to go now. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your assistance. .
