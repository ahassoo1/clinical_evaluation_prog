DOCTOR: Alright, Soila, good to meet you. I see you’re 90 years young! That’s wonderful. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Doctor… Osterholm, yes? It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, my tummy feels… big. Like it’s full of water, maybe? And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Everything just… doesn’t taste good. It’s been… a little while, I think. Hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Osterholm, yes, that’s right. Okay, “tummy feels big,” and loss of appetite… and things don’t taste good anymore. “A little while” is… helpful. Is it more than a week?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a week? Maybe… longer? I… I really can’t be sure. Time goes so quickly now, you know? It feels like just yesterday I was… well, I don't remember what I was doing yesterday! It’s just… been happening. Not suddenly, but slow-like.
DOCTOR: Right, “slow-like.” Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Oh… let me think. Not that I recall. My granddaughter, bless her heart, visits sometimes. She brings me… what does she bring? Oh, soup, I think. And… the weather’s been warm. Is that a change?
DOCTOR: No, the weather isn't what I meant. Have you noticed any new symptoms?
PATIENT: New… symptoms? Oh, you mean… things that hurt? Well, sometimes my tummy feels… tight. Like a balloon. And… I get tired very easily. Even just walking to the kitchen is… a lot. But… I’ve always been a little tired, haven’t I? It’s hard to say what’s new anymore.
DOCTOR: “Tight tummy,” fatigue… Okay. And are you having any trouble… going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh… going to the bathroom… Well, not as often as I used to. And… it takes a little longer, sometimes. Old age, you know? Everything slows down! Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It can be. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? What kind of exam? Will it hurt? I’m a little… fragile, you know? I don't want to break anything!
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt, I promise. Just listening to your tummy, and feeling it gently. And I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Nothing scary at all. Just routine. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you say so. It’s… a bit high, isn’t it? I hope I can get up again afterwards. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: There we go. Just lie flat, if you can. Hmm… sounds a bit… full. And… tender. Definitely tender. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 80. A little elevated, but not alarming.
PATIENT: Oh… that tickles! Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem to be… frowning. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Like a big balloon, you said? That’s exactly how it feels. I'm not sure what's happening. I just want to feel better. Can you tell me what's wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a few things. Given your age and symptoms – the fullness, loss of appetite, tenderness – it’s possible you have some constipation, causing a bit of a backup. It could also be something more serious, like a blockage, or even… well, let's not jump to conclusions. But given your vague recollections and the fact that you’re not on any regular medication, I want to be thorough. We need to get some blood work done. And I think a scan of your abdomen would be wise. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And I’ll get a referral to radiology for an abdominal CT scan.
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and a… scan? That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And what if something is wrong? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Can’t you just… give me something for my tummy? Something to make it stop feeling like a balloon?
DOCTOR: Look, Soila, I understand you’re worried. But we need to find out what’s going on before I can give you anything. It’s like trying to fix a car without knowing what’s broken! The blood work will tell us if there’s any infection or other problems. The scan will show us what's happening inside your abdomen. We're just being cautious. I will give you a stool softener for now, to help with the fullness. But we need those tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A stool… what? I don’t understand all this… medical talk. But… alright. If you think it’s best. Tests… and stool softeners. My granddaughter can help me with the tests, I suppose. But… will it be much longer before I feel better? I just want to have a little appetite again. And maybe a little energy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Look, I’m going to order these tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood right away. The referral is for the radiology center; they’re about ten minutes from here. Your granddaughter will need to schedule the scan. It's just an imaging test, nothing scary. And the stool softener… it’s a gentle medication to help things move along. It won't give you a lot of energy right away, but it should help with the fullness. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. The sooner we get these tests done, the sooner we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Oh… so much. My granddaughter is good with computers, yes. She’ll schedule everything. But… will they hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if it’s something bad? I just want to be… comfortable. And maybe eat a little soup. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, Soila, I understand you’re anxious, but catastrophizing isn’t going to help. The tests are routine. They might feel a little pinch, but it won’t last. As for the results, it usually takes a couple of days. And honestly, worrying about something bad before we even know what’s going on is pointless. Let’s just focus on getting these tests done, okay?
