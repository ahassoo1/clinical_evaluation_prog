DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Is… is that how you say it? It is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here because the… the office called, yes? For a check-up, a… a talk over the phone, but in person. My husband… he always did the calling. I do not know much about this visit, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that's right. The office does preventative outreach calls, especially for our Medicare patients. It’s a good thing they did! It sounds like this is a comprehensive check-up to make sure everything is going well. Your husband sounds very proactive. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh. Preventative. Yes, he liked that word. Always said to prevent is better than… than fixing. Overall… well, I am mostly okay, I think. I am a mechanic, you know? Always working with the cars. It keeps me busy. But my back… sometimes it hurts. And I get tired easier now than before. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: That's good that you stay busy! And yes, it’s very common to experience more fatigue and some aches and pains as we get older, especially with a physically demanding job like a mechanic. We can definitely look into both of those things today. Let's start with your back pain. Can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain. It is worse when I bend over, or… when I have been standing a long time. Like after a long day in the shop. Sometimes, it goes all the way down my leg, a little. Not always, though. I just… I thought it was from the work. Old age, maybe. My husband, he would rub it with something. I do not remember what, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that radiates down your leg, worse with bending and standing for long periods. That gives us a good starting point. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot, or any weakness when you try to move it?
PATIENT: No, not really. No… tingle. And I can move my leg. I can walk. I can… lift things. Though, like I said, it gets harder. Sometimes, in the morning, it is stiff. Very stiff. Like an old machine that has not been used for a while. Does that make sense? Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Benites. Stiffness in the morning is a common symptom. It is important information, and helps us build a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other parts of your body. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or any other symptoms like unexplained weight loss, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Vision… well, I need my glasses, yes? Stronger glasses than before, maybe. But that is just old age, I think. Hearing… sometimes the shop is very loud. No fever. No… sweats. I have lost a little weight, maybe? But I am not eating as much. After my husband… it is hard to cook. I eat simple things, now. Soup, mostly. Nothing fancy. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. It absolutely matters. It’s very common to experience changes in appetite and weight after a loss, and we can address that. Let's briefly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think so. Yes, the doctor told me, a long time ago. I take… a white pill. Every morning. Is that for that? My husband, he kept track of all the pills. I just… take them. He said it was important. No… no diabetes. I do not think so. And my heart… I have never had any problems with my heart. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. Do you know the name of the medication, by any chance?
PATIENT: No… no, I do not think so. It is a small white pill. That is all I know. The bottle… it has my name on it. And a number. My husband always filled it, at the… at the pharmacy. I do not remember the name of the pill. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. We can easily look that up in our system. Let's move on to any previous surgeries or hospitalizations you may have had. Have you ever had any operations or been admitted to the hospital for any reason?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. No hospital. I broke my arm, when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. Just a cast. They put it in a cast. Nothing serious. After that… no. I have been very lucky, I think. Always healthy. Until… until now, maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: My father… he had a bad heart. Very bad. He died when he was young. My mother… she lived a long life. But she had… something with her memory. Not so good in the end. My brother… he is healthy. As far as I know. We do not talk much. Cancer… I think my aunt had cancer. But that was a long time ago. Is that enough? Is that what you need to know? It is hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Benites, thank you. And yes, that's enough for now. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no! Never. Smoking? Never touched one. Alcohol… maybe a small glass of wine, with dinner, sometimes. But not often. And… drugs? No! Never. I do not like those things. My husband, he did not either. We were always very… sensible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Ms. Benites, that gives me a pretty good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. Blood pressure… is that the thing with the… the cuff? My husband always took it. I hope it is not too high. I am ready. I think. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt at all, Ms. Benites. It just feels a little tight around your arm for a moment. We’ll start with that, then listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. And I'll gently examine your back. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some mild crackles in your lungs. Your back is tender to the touch, especially on the lower left side. There's also some muscle spasm. It sounds like we're dealing with some musculoskeletal pain, possibly related to your job, but the crackles in your lungs warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues, and some blood work to check your overall health and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… crackles? That does not sound good. My lungs? Is it… serious? X-ray? Blood work? I… I do not know. My husband, he always made these decisions. He knew what to do. I trust you, Doctor. If you think it is necessary, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Benites. The crackles could be due to a number of things, and we want to make sure we rule out anything serious. The X-ray is painless - you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The blood work involves a small needle prick, and it usually takes just a few minutes. We’ll have the results back within a couple of days. To be on the safe side, I'm also going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help with your back pain. We should also consider a referral to a physical therapist. We'll get everything scheduled for you at the front desk. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I do not think so. I have never had a reaction to any medicine, as far as I know. My husband always checked the labels. Wait… maybe. When I was a little girl, I took some… some pink medicine. And I got a rash. But it was a long time ago. I do not remember what it was for. And I do not know if it was the medicine, or something else. Is that important? Should I remember? I am sorry. My memory is not so good these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Benites, it’s good you mentioned that. Any history of rash is important to note. We’ll document that as a possible allergy to an unknown medication. Okay, so to recap, we’re going to schedule a chest X-ray and blood work. I’m prescribing a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever, and we’ll discuss a referral to physical therapy after we get the test results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I am just… a little overwhelmed, I suppose. It is a lot to take in. Will you… will you call me with the results? I do not want to forget to call. And… is it… is it likely to be something serious? My husband… he always worried about my lungs. He worked in a factory, you know. With dust. I worry… that maybe I have something like him.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites, I will personally call you with the results. And don’t worry about forgetting – I’ll make a note to call you directly. It's good you mentioned your husband’s work history. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but we're taking all the necessary steps to find out. Most of the time, crackles in the lungs are due to something relatively minor, like a mild infection. But it’s important to rule out anything more serious, and that's what we're doing. We'll take things one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. The front desk will schedule your X-ray and blood work, and I'll see you again after we have those results to discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I… I appreciate your patience. I should… I should probably go now. Get this scheduled. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. It was nice meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. The front desk staff will take good care of you. Have a good day.
