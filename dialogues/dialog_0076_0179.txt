DOCTOR: Right, Sherrell Gyamfi. Forty-six years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor... Ruocco, is it? It is... difficult to explain. Words… they do not come so easy now. It is like they are… hiding. I have trouble finding the right ones, you see? It makes talking… frustrating. Not for you, I hope? I do not mean to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Look, I have a lot of patients, so if you could just try to be concise, that would be helpful. Hiding words… alright. Is this something that came on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Not… bang, like that. More… slowly. Over, perhaps… many months? It is hard to say exactly. My wife… she would know better. But… she is gone now. So, it is… difficult to remember when it truly began. I apologize. It is not a clear answer, I know.
DOCTOR: Right, gone… and gradual. Okay. And is this trouble with words affecting anything else?
PATIENT: Affecting… other things? Ah… yes. Sometimes, I… struggle with names. People I have known for a long time! It is very embarrassing. And… I find it harder to follow conversations, if they are… fast. I must ask them to repeat things. My job… it requires much talking and… understanding. It is becoming… difficult. I do compensation, benefits, and job analysis. It needs clear thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, names, following conversations… job is… what was it?
PATIENT: Compensation… benefits… and job analysis, Doctor. I help people with their… work things. Pay, insurance… what the job requires. It is… details. Many, many details. And the words… they are important for that. I am sorry. Is this… helpful information? I do not want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, trouble with words, names, following conversations, details important for work. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other symptoms? Hmm… Not that I can recall, Doctor. Sometimes, I feel… tired. But I am older now. Perhaps that is just age? I… do not know. My memory… it is not what it once was. Though I don’t think that’s the same as the words. It is more… they are there, but I cannot reach them. Like something is blocking me. I apologize if this is confusing. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm going to quickly run through a standard review of systems, just to cover the basics. It will be quicker than trying to decipher this... vague recollection. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… ah, yes. I believe… penicillin, many years ago. A rash, I think. It was a long time ago. Not much else, Doctor. I do not recall any other allergies. I mostly eat… normal food. Nothing fancy. Just… German things, sometimes. My wife was a good cook.
DOCTOR: Penicillin. Okay. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just… for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, every morning. And… sometimes, a pain reliever for my back. When it flares up. Nothing else, Doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. My wife always said… too much medicine is not good.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… and pain reliever as needed. Right. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Though, please excuse my… slowness. It takes a moment, you see? My back… it is not always cooperating. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Pulse is… normal. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… unremarkable. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not surprising. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am following… is it… alright? My eyes… they are not what they once were either. Is it too slow? I am trying my best. Do you need me to… do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes. Two plus. Not bad. You’re… reasonably intact. Okay. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and this brief exam… it could be early cognitive decline, potentially related to vascular changes. It’s very preliminary, of course. But it’s worth investigating. We'll need some blood work, and possibly an MRI. I'll write you a referral to a neurologist.
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? Vascular… changes? Neurologist? I… I am sorry, Doctor. I do not understand. Is something… seriously wrong? My wife… she would have known what this means. Is this… bad? I just wanted to know why I cannot find the words anymore. I apologize for being difficult. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Look, it could be nothing. But it's better to rule things out. The neurologist will do some tests. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild cognitive enhancer – it won’t fix anything, but it might help with the words. And I suggest you try some brain exercises – puzzles, crosswords, that sort of thing. Okay?
PATIENT: Tests… prescription… brain exercises… yes, Doctor. I will… try my best. But… is this something… I should be worried about? Will this get worse? Is there… anything I can do besides tests and puzzles? My wife… she always knew what to do. I feel… lost. I apologize if I am asking too much. It’s just… frightening, you see.
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. We’ve covered the basics. The neurologist will explain everything in detail. Here are your referrals and prescription. Follow up with them as soon as possible. And try not to worry too much. It’s probably just age. Next!
