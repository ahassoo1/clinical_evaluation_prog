DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it's this unsteadiness. I feel… off balance, sometimes. It’s difficult to explain, and truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize in advance if I struggle to recall details. It’s been… troubling.
DOCTOR: Please, do not apologize at all, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly alright if details are difficult to recall; we’ll work through this together at your pace. “Unsteadiness” is a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: It’s… sporadic. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. Sometimes it feels like the room is swaying, even when it isn’t. Other times, I just… stumble. Not fall, usually, but it’s disconcerting. It seems worse when I’m tired, I think. Or perhaps after a long shift… though, honestly, they all blur together a little. I operate a rotary drill, you see, in the oil fields. It's… demanding work. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Snerling. Physically demanding work can certainly contribute to various sensations. It’s helpful to know. And thank you for mentioning the rotary drill; that provides valuable context. When did you first notice this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not like I could say, “On this date…” It’s been gradual, I believe. Perhaps… six months ago? Or maybe a little longer? It started as just feeling a bit clumsy, and has slowly gotten… more noticeable. Around the time… well, around the time of my husband’s passing, if that’s relevant. Everything feels a bit… hazy around then. I apologize again, Doctor. It's truly frustrating not to be more precise.
DOCTOR: Please, do not apologize, Ms. Snerling. Grief can absolutely affect one’s memory and perception. It is entirely relevant that this started around the time of your husband’s passing, and I am very sorry for your loss. So, it’s been approximately six months, with a gradual onset, and it seems to be worsening. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No dizziness, exactly. Though sometimes I feel a bit… lightheaded, especially when I stand up quickly. And I suppose my vision gets a little blurry occasionally, but I always attributed that to fatigue. Long hours, you see. And the dust… so much dust in the oil fields. No nausea, no headaches… just the feeling of being off balance, and that occasional lightheadedness. It’s… subtle, mostly. It’s just enough to make me worry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Snerling. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not that I recall, no. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, thankfully. A few minor illnesses, colds and such, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… I received regular checkups when my husband was still with us, but I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time, truthfully. He handled most of the appointments. I do have private insurance, thankfully. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. And it's good to know you have insurance. Now, have you ever taken any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after a long shift. Just over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing prescribed. And sometimes… a multivitamin. Just to supplement my diet, you know? I try to eat well, but it’s difficult with the hours. No regular medications, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, within reason, of course. I've never had cause to avoid anything. I apologize if this is all very vague. It's just… difficult to remember details sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly well, Ms. Snerling. Please, do not apologize. We will get through this together. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he passed away when I was young, from a heart condition, I think. Nothing specific, you understand. My husband’s family… I’m not entirely sure. We didn’t discuss medical history much. They lived far away. I apologize again, Doctor. My family wasn't terribly forthcoming about such things. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Snerling. You’ve provided what you can recall, and that is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… well, as I mentioned, I work as a rotary drill operator in the oil fields. It’s… physically demanding work, long hours, often outdoors. I don't have much time for hobbies, truthfully. I live alone now, so I mostly… keep to myself. I try to eat a balanced diet, but it's difficult with the schedule. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I suppose I could use more exercise… but I'm usually too tired after work. Does that give you a picture? It's… a rather solitary existence, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a very good picture, Ms. Snerling. It sounds like a very demanding lifestyle, and it's understandable that you're feeling the effects. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. This will help me assess your overall health and try to determine the cause of your unsteadiness. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and neurological function. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle, if you would. It’s… difficult for me to be still for long periods. And I apologize in advance if I'm not very cooperative. It’s just… a bit unsettling, being examined. But I understand it’s necessary to find out what’s causing this unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Snerling. We’ll take things slowly and at your pace. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart rate is 72 and regular. I do hear a slight murmur, but it's quite faint. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there is some mild difficulty with coordination. Your reflexes are normal. No tenderness or masses palpated. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves... Everything appears intact, although you do seem slightly diminished in your range of motion and your balance is a bit diminished. We'll need to do some more tests.
PATIENT: I see. Diminished… unsteady… More tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? Is it… serious? I apologize, I'm probably being overly anxious. It’s just… the thought of something being wrong… It’s unsettling, to say the least. And what does this mean? Will I be able to continue working? It’s… my livelihood, you see. I'm very concerned.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Snerling. It's understandable given the circumstances. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. The findings from the examination aren't necessarily indicative of something serious, but they do warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level to rule out any underlying deficiencies. Additionally, I recommend an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of the neurological structures and rule out any structural abnormalities. As for your ability to continue working, we will need to assess the results of these tests before making any definitive decisions. It's possible that this is related to fatigue or a minor imbalance, and with appropriate treatment, you may be able to continue working without any restrictions. However, if the MRI reveals a structural abnormality, we may need to discuss alternative options. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll write you a referral for the MRI and the bloodwork. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is located nearby. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral process?
PATIENT: An MRI… I see. And bloodwork, of course. No… I don't think so, not at the moment. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. The lab is down the hall, the imaging center nearby… I can manage that. But… what if it is something serious? What are we looking for, exactly? I understand you don't want to alarm me, but… a little information might ease my anxiety. And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m worried about leaving work unattended for too long. It’s a demanding job, you see, and it’s difficult to find reliable replacements. I apologize, I’m probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too much at all, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand what we're looking for and what to expect. With the MRI, we’re primarily looking for any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, inflammation, or evidence of a stroke. The bloodwork will help us assess your overall health and rule out any deficiencies, such as vitamin D or electrolyte imbalances, that could be contributing to your unsteadiness. It’s important to remember that the vast majority of brain MRIs are normal. However, it's always best to be thorough and rule out any potential causes. As for the results, the bloodwork should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI results typically take a bit longer, around 3-5 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any strenuous activities and prioritize rest. If your unsteadiness worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as headaches, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please contact me immediately. Here's the referral for the MRI and the lab order. I'll also write you a note to take to your work explaining that you're undergoing medical evaluation. Would you like me to outline some additional measures to prepare for the MRI, such as removing any metal objects or informing the technician of any medical implants you may have?
PATIENT: That’s… very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing what to expect, and what you’re looking for… it eases my mind considerably. Yes, please. A list of measures to prepare for the MRI would be wonderful. I don't have any medical implants, as far as I know, but it's good to be prepared. And thank you for the note to work. That will be very helpful. And… if the MRI does reveal something concerning… what are the next steps? I understand it’s difficult to say without knowing the results, but… a general idea might help me prepare. I apologize, I’m probably being overly anxious again. But the thought of something being wrong… it’s unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: You’re not being overly anxious at all, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly natural to want to be prepared for all possibilities. If the MRI reveals a structural abnormality, the next steps will depend on the nature and location of the abnormality. In some cases, it may be necessary to consult with a neurologist or neurosurgeon for further evaluation and treatment. Treatment options could range from medication and physical therapy to more invasive procedures, such as surgery. However, it’s important to remember that we haven’t even received the results of the MRI yet. There’s a good chance that everything will be normal, and we can attribute your unsteadiness to a minor imbalance or fatigue. Here’s a pamphlet outlining the MRI procedure and what to expect. It also includes information about potential findings and treatment options. I also want you to know that I’ll be here to guide you through every step of the process, and we’ll make decisions together. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very informative. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve eased my anxiety considerably. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I’ll schedule the MRI and bloodwork as soon as possible. And I’ll keep you informed of the results. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. I appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. Please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
