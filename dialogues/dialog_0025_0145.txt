DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bahta, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I am here today... well, to see if my wife might be eligible for some help at home. She has been... not doing well, and I am hoping for some assistance. It is a bit difficult for me to manage everything on my own now.
DOCTOR: “Assistance at home,” you say. Right. And what exactly does “not doing well” entail?
PATIENT: It is... difficult to explain simply. She is very weak, mostly. She tires very easily. She needs help with... everything, really. Dressing, bathing... even eating sometimes. She is not herself at all, Doctor. She used to be so strong, so independent. Now... she mostly sleeps. It has been this way for... oh, about three months now, getting steadily worse. She also has very little appetite, and barely drinks any water.
DOCTOR: Three months, you say. And has she seen a doctor about this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has. Several times, actually. Dr. Levesque, he is her primary care physician. He ran some tests... many tests, I believe. He says it is... a complicated situation. He suggested we look into home health or perhaps hospice care, and gave me your name. That is why I am here today. I have all the paperwork from Dr. Levesque, if you would like to see it?
DOCTOR: Paperwork is…fine. Though, frankly, primary care physicians often miss things. What specifically did Dr. Levesque tell you was wrong?
PATIENT: That is a... a good question. He did not say specifically. He used... terms I did not understand, to be honest. Something about... organ failure, I believe? And something about fluid buildup in her lungs. He said it was advanced, and that her quality of life was... declining. He did say it was not a sudden illness, and that it had been a slow process. It is very upsetting, Doctor. I am not a medical man, so I mostly just listened and nodded.
DOCTOR: "Advanced" and "declining"...how wonderfully vague. Let's pull up her records. Hmm. Alright, Lonell Bahta, age 54. I see some history of hypertension, well-controlled, and...ah. Frequent hospitalizations for shortness of breath, diagnosed as congestive heart failure. Seems Dr. Levesque has been doing something. What medications is she currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a moment, Doctor. I keep a list, as I am responsible for managing them. Let me see… she takes Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. Also, Furosemide, 40 milligrams twice a day. And… Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams once a day. Oh, and a potassium supplement, because of the Furosemide. I believe that is all. She takes them with breakfast and dinner, religiously. I ensure that she does.
DOCTOR: Right. Standard CHF regimen, though the Digoxin is a bit…aggressive these days. Has she been compliant with a low-sodium diet?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. She tries to be. But her appetite is so poor lately, she doesn’t eat much at all. And when she does have an appetite, she often craves salty foods. I try to limit it, of course, but it is… hard to deny her anything when she is feeling so unwell. I have been preparing bland meals, but she barely touches them. I confess, I have not been very strict about the salt recently. It just seems… cruel to withhold comfort food when she is suffering.
DOCTOR: “Cruel,” you say. Mr. Bahta, you are enabling a decline. A low-sodium diet is essential in managing congestive heart failure. Now, beyond the shortness of breath and fatigue, has she noticed any swelling in her ankles or legs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has. Quite a bit, actually. Her ankles swell up terribly by the end of the day, even if she has been resting. And her legs… they are often puffy and discolored. It seems to be getting worse, even with her elevated legs. She complains of discomfort, though she is not one to complain much. It is another thing I have been trying to help with – elevating her legs, rubbing them gently. It offers some relief, but it is temporary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is she experiencing any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not chest pain, thankfully. She has not mentioned any chest pain at all. She does sometimes complain of… a tightness in her chest, like she is having trouble breathing, but no actual pain. It comes and goes, mostly when she exerts herself, even just a little. But it is not a sharp, acute pain, if that makes sense. It’s more like… discomfort, a feeling of being suffocated, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright. A tightness… We’ll note that. Now, let's do a quick exam. I need to listen to her lungs and heart, check for edema, and assess her overall condition. Is she able to walk, even with assistance?
PATIENT: Yes, she is able to walk, but only with assistance. She is very weak, and tires easily. She needs me to support her, and she can only manage a few steps at a time. She uses a walker in the house, but even that is becoming difficult for her. She is very unsteady, and I worry she will fall. I assist her with everything, Doctor. I’ve had to install grab bars in the bathroom and hallways.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have her come in when she’s able. We’ll start with lung sounds and assess the edema. She can change in the examination room, and I’ll be right in.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. She is… not very mobile, so it may take a few minutes for her to get ready. I will assist her as best as I can. Please, let me know if you need anything from me.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I’ll be ready when you are.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
