DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. My name is Nicoletta McNabb, though everyone just calls me Nicoletta. Well, I suppose what brings me in… it's hard to put into words exactly. I’m… well, I’m 87 years young, and I feel like I need a little… a little jumpstart, if you will. A reset. I want to feel… better. More me, you know? I still want to enjoy life, but lately, things have just been… sluggish.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Nicoletta. It’s wonderful you're taking the initiative to address this. Feeling sluggish and wanting to regain your energy at 87 is a very valid reason to come in. We'll definitely work on getting you feeling more like yourself. When you say "sluggish," can you tell me more specifically what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a pain, not exactly. It’s more… like wading through water. Everything takes effort. Getting up in the morning is harder, even though I always have been a morning person. And I used to love to garden, but now… just the thought of it exhausts me. I don’t have the pep I used to. I find myself sitting more, watching television, when I’d rather be doing something. And…oh dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be either, but I suppose that comes with age. But it feels…more than just age, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Nicoletta. It's good you're noticing these changes and are describing them so well. It is helpful to differentiate between what might be expected with age and what feels different. So, the fatigue and difficulty with activities like gardening… has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been very gradual. Not something that happened overnight, no. I think it’s been… maybe the last year or so that I’ve really noticed it. At first, I just thought I was getting a bit lazy, to be honest! But it’s gotten to the point where it’s really bothering me. I used to be so active, always volunteering at the school, helping with the children. Now… I just don't have the energy. I miss it, you know? It’s not just the physical tiredness, it’s like… my spirit is tired too.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicoletta. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, and it's good you’ve come in to address it. That “spirit being tired” is important, and we want to look at everything. Let's talk a little bit more about your daily routine. Besides the volunteering, what else do you typically do in a day?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone since my husband, George, passed away about ten years ago now. I still try to keep busy. I get up, have a light breakfast – usually just toast and coffee. I read the newspaper, do a little crossword puzzle to keep my mind sharp. I used to cook big meals, but now I mostly just have something simple, like a sandwich or soup. I watch television in the evenings, and I try to get out and walk a little bit, though that's getting harder too. I have a friend, Maria, who comes over every other day to have tea, and we chat. That’s always nice. I try to stay social, but… it takes effort, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full life, Nicoletta, despite everything. It’s wonderful you’re maintaining connections with friends and keeping your mind active. Losing George must have been incredibly difficult, and you've adjusted remarkably. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… George always handled the medical things, bless his heart. I’ve had my share of aches and pains, of course – arthritis in my knees, mostly. The doctor told me I had slightly high blood pressure a few years back, but he put me on a little pill for it, and I’ve been taking that ever since. Nothing major, really. I had a bad fall a couple of years ago and broke my wrist, but that’s healed up fine. Oh, and I used to have terrible migraines when I was younger, but those have pretty much gone away on their own. I think that’s about it. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see here in your records that you’ve been prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension, as you mentioned, and there's a note about the wrist fracture in 2023. It also looks like you have regular check-ups with Dr. Alvarez. Good. Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes! Dr. Alvarez recommended I take a Vitamin D supplement, as he said my levels were a bit low. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little bit of melatonin. Just a tiny bit, mind you. And… oh dear, what else? Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they’re really bothering me. But that’s about it. I don’t really like taking a lot of pills, so I try to avoid them whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril for blood pressure, Vitamin D, melatonin as needed for sleep, and ibuprofen for your knees. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. George used to say I had a cast-iron stomach! I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with any medication. I’ve always been very careful about what I put in my body, though. I believe in moderation, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nicoletta. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, but I don’t really remember much about her health. She had a bit of arthritis, like me, and she had some trouble with her memory towards the end, but it wasn’t really diagnosed. My father died relatively young, from a heart attack, I think. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn't take very good care of himself, to be honest. He didn’t listen to the doctors. So, I suppose there’s a bit of heart disease and diabetes in the family, but nothing too serious on my mother’s side.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of heart disease on your father’s side and diabetes in your brother. And some memory issues in your mother, potentially. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Oh, social habits? Well, I don’t drink alcohol, never have. And I certainly don't smoke! George used to smoke a pipe, but he quit years ago. I live a pretty quiet life, as I mentioned. I enjoy spending time with my friend Maria, and I like to read and watch television. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the school and church, but I don’t do as much of that anymore. It just takes too much energy, you know? I try to stay connected with my grandchildren, but they live far away, so we mostly just talk on the phone.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle overall, Nicoletta. It's good you prioritize connection with your family, even from a distance. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/85, but not alarmingly so. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear, which is good. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and your balance is slightly unsteady, but nothing too concerning at this point. Overall, the exam is unremarkable, but the slightly diminished reflexes and unsteady balance, coupled with your reported fatigue, warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. We should also check your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and do a thorough examination. So, blood tests, you said? Will I need to make another appointment for those, or can they be done today?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nicoletta. It’s my pleasure. We can actually do those blood tests today, right here in the clinic. It’ll just take a few minutes. The lab technician is available now. After the tests, we'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Today is good. I’d rather get it over with than wait, if possible. Lead the way, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's go ahead and get those blood tests done then. .
PATIENT: .
