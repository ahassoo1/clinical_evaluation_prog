DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just hasn’t gone away. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs… even my back is bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cassimatis. Itching can be very distressing. “All over,” you say – arms, legs, and back. And you mentioned this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe… four or five? It’s hard to say exactly, time just seems to slip away these days, you know? It doesn't seem to be getting worse, exactly, but it’s just… constantly there. It's not like a rash, though. Just… itchiness.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Constantly there" is helpful to know. And you’re right, the fact that it isn’t a visible rash is important. To clarify, is the itchiness the same all over, or are some areas more bothersome than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think my back is the worst. It's hard to reach, so maybe that's why I notice it more? And my ankles… they get really itchy, especially at night. The rest is… just annoying, you know? Not as bad as those two spots.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the back and ankles are the most bothersome – particularly at night. And the rest is a more generalized annoyance. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the itchiness, or make it better?
PATIENT: You know, that's another thing I've been trying to figure out! I haven't really noticed anything specific making it worse. I've tried different lotions, just regular ones, nothing special, but they don't seem to help much. As for better… maybe when I’m distracted? If I'm busy doing something, I forget about it for a little while. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Distraction offering temporary relief is a useful observation. And regular lotions haven’t provided much help. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the itchiness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no tiredness, no… bumps or anything like that. Just the itch. It’s just… really uncomfortable. And it’s keeping me up at night, which isn't good. I haven't changed anything in my routine, either. Same soaps, same laundry detergent… I’m just puzzled.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. No other associated symptoms, and no changes in your routine. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years? And I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing too bad. I also had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, for my age, I think. I don’t see the doctor very often, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, some arthritis in the hands, and controlled high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned medication for the blood pressure – could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s Lisinopril, I believe. Just one pill every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it, really. I don't take a lot of pills. I haven't changed any medications recently, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Cassimatis. Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen. No recent changes. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much! My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. I’ve never had trouble with any medications either. I’ve taken a few different things over the years for colds and flu, but nothing ever bothered me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Cassimatis. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother lived to be 95, so good genes on that side, I guess! She had arthritis, like me, but that was about it. My father… he had heart problems, I think. And my brother had high blood pressure, too. But other than that, nothing major that I can recall. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about health issues, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis, heart problems, and high blood pressure. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I’m divorced. Been divorced for… oh, a long time now. I live alone. I have a few friends, we get together for lunch sometimes. And I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week. That keeps me busy. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, living alone, social activity with friends and volunteering. No smoking, occasional glass of wine. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your itchiness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I just want to get this figured out! It’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll take a look at your skin. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart and lungs sound clear, Ms. Cassimatis. And upon visual examination of your skin, I don't see any obvious signs of rash, hives, or other skin conditions. There is some mild dryness, particularly on your ankles, but nothing that would immediately explain the intensity of your itchiness. I'll also gently palpate your lymph nodes… Your lymph nodes are not enlarged.
PATIENT: Okay. That's… good, I guess. So, you don't see anything obvious? It's just… frustrating. It feels like I'm imagining it, but it’s so itchy! What do you think it could be then, Doctor? Do I need any tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good that we haven't found anything immediately concerning, but that doesn't diminish how bothersome your symptoms are. Given your history and the physical exam findings, several possibilities could be contributing to your itchiness. These include dry skin – even without visible rash, it can cause significant itching – and the possibility of a mild allergic reaction to something in your environment. Less common possibilities, given your age and history, include certain underlying medical conditions, though those are less likely given the lack of other symptoms. To rule out some of those less common causes, and to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will assess your overall health and kidney function. I also recommend a liver function test, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to make it stop! So, blood tests, okay. Will I need a special appointment for those? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can draw the blood samples here in the clinic today. It will only take a few minutes. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin, especially after bathing. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. You could also try an over-the-counter antihistamine, like diphenhydramine or loratadine, to see if that provides any relief. However, please be aware that diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or these recommendations?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Moisturize, avoid harsh soaps, and try an antihistamine. Blood tests in a few days, then a follow-up appointment. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. It’s been really bothering me, and I feel better just knowing we’re trying to find the cause.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I understand how frustrating chronic itchiness can be, and I’m glad we’re working towards a solution. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion today, including the test orders and recommendations. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you when the results are back. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. You have a good day as well.
