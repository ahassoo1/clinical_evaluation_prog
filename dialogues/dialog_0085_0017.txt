DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well... the young man, he told me I need this... paper. For the tryouts. Baseball. I used to... play. A long time ago. It’s for... the team. Yes. That's it. A physical. Is that what you call it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, a physical exam. It's a routine check-up to make sure you’re healthy enough for baseball tryouts. That’s perfectly fine. So, you're hoping to join a baseball team?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, try to join. It’s been… years. A long, long time. My knees... they aren’t what they used to be, you understand. But I keep myself… active. Mostly. It’s just a formality, I think. The young man said I needed this paper, and then I can… try. Is that enough? Do I need to do… jumping jacks or something?
DOCTOR: No jumping jacks necessary, Mr. Bartok. We'll just go through some standard checks – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and maybe take a look at those knees you mentioned. We’ll also go over your medical history to make sure everything looks good. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit more about your knees?
PATIENT: Well... they ache. Sometimes. Especially when it rains. Or when I… stand for a long time. I don't remember anything bad happening to them. A slide maybe? Or a twist? It was a long time ago, you see. Lots of baseball. And… work. I did construction. Heavy lifting. Not as much now. They just… feel old. And a little stiff. Does that make sense? I don’t go to doctors much. Not a fan, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Bartok. A lot of aches and pains can come with years of activity, especially with baseball and construction work. It’s good you're being proactive about getting it checked out. Have you noticed any swelling in the knees?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… sometimes. After I’ve been… on them a lot. Not always. It goes down. Usually after I rest. It’s… not much. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like… ballooning up or anything. Just a little… puffiness, maybe? I’m not a doctor, you see. I don’t know the words for things. Does that make sense? It’s mostly just the ache. The ache is the worst part.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You're describing it perfectly. "Puffiness" is a good word for it. Okay, so some occasional puffiness and mostly just aches. And just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any injuries to either knee that required treatment – like a brace, physical therapy, or a doctor’s visit?
PATIENT: A doctor’s visit… hmm. I remember… something. A long time ago. I think. Maybe a sprain? When I was younger. Playing… I can’t quite recall. It was… wrapped. With a bandage. A white bandage. And I had to stay off it for a… week? Or was it two? It was a long time ago. I don't have the best memory, you see. It didn’t seem very serious. I just… taped it up and went back to playing. No physical therapy, I don’t think. No brace. Just tape. A lot of tape.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sprain a long time ago that was treated with tape and rest. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about any other medical issues you might have. Do you have any health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood… what was it? No. Not that I know of. The doctor… always said I was… healthy. Mostly. I used to get… colds, like anyone. And a little… indigestion sometimes. But nothing serious. I don't take any pills. Never have. I don't like pills. The young man, he said I was… good to go. But he wanted this paper. That's all. I just want to play a little baseball. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Bartok. And it sounds like you’ve been generally healthy. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. I think… my appendix. When I was… very young. A long, long time ago. I was just a boy. And… that’s it. I don’t remember much about it. A little… blurry. And no surgeries. Never had any surgeries. I avoid doctors as much as possible, you see. Too much poking and prodding. It’s just… unpleasant. I’d rather be playing baseball. Is this… almost done? I have to get back to… things.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost finished, Mr. Bartok. Just a few more questions about allergies and family history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Mostly. And I haven’t had any problems with… bee stings or anything. Nothing. I used to be around… dust a lot, with the construction. But I didn't sneeze or anything. I think. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing. I just… keep busy, you see. I don’t have time to worry about allergies. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's not bad at all, Mr. Bartok. And lastly, is there any significant medical history in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had… something. With his heart. I think. He got… tired easily. And he didn't… live very long. But it was a long time ago. And my mother… she had… aches and pains, like me. But nothing serious. Just… old age, I think. And that's it. I don't know much about my… ancestors. We didn’t talk about that sort of thing. I just know they… lived. And worked. Is that enough? Can I… go now? I have to… practice. A little bit. Before the tryout.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you've given me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I need to get back… you understand. Baseball. The young man is waiting. And I need to… stretch. A little. My knees… they aren’t getting any younger. So… alright. Let’s get it over with. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. If you could please have a seat on the table. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you lie down for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Elevated? Is that bad? My knees… they always feel… something. It’s hard to explain. They crack, mostly. And ache. Like I said. Go ahead. Quickly, please. I have to… practice. Before the young man gets… impatient. You know how these young people are. Always rushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Let's start with this knee. Can you bend it for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Oof. There we go. That’s… about as far as it goes. It’s… stiff. And it creaks. A lot. Like an old door. I told you. It isn’t getting any younger. And… it feels… a little… warm, maybe? Not hot, just… warm. Does that make sense? I haven’t used it much lately. Mostly just… walking. And… standing. It’s hard to explain. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some creaking, and you're right, there's a slight warmth. There is some tenderness here on the inside of your knee, but no significant swelling. And how does this knee feel compared to the other one?
PATIENT: Hmm. This one… is a little better. Not as stiff. Not as warm. It creaks too, of course. They both creak. But this one… doesn't ache as much. And I can… bend it a little further. Not much, but… a little. It's hard to explain. It's like… one is older than the other. Which is… silly, I know. They're both the same age. But that's how it feels. Go ahead. Quickly, please. I need to… stretch. Before the tryout.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees, which is common with age and activity. It's causing some creaking, stiffness, and mild tenderness. There’s no significant swelling, which is good. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing alarming at this point. I recommend some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, for the aches and pains. Regular, gentle stretching and low-impact exercise like swimming or walking can also help. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… what was that? Ibuprofen? Naproxen? I don’t take pills, Doctor. Remember? Stretching… I do a little bit. Walking… yes, I walk. Low-impact… is that like… slow baseball? So… am I good to go for the tryout? That's all I really want to know. Can I play a little baseball? Is that… allowed? I don’t want to… hurt myself. But I want to… try. That's all. Am I… allowed?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Over-the-counter means you can buy it at the pharmacy without a prescription. Ibuprofen and naproxen are pain relievers that can help with the knee aches, if you’re willing to try them. As for the tryout, given your mild osteoarthritis, I don’t see any reason why you can’t try. However, it’s important to listen to your body. Start slowly, warm up properly, and stop if you feel any significant pain. Don’t push yourself too hard. I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that put a lot of stress on your knees, and definitely consult with the team coach before participating in any intense drills. Would you like me to write a note for the coach explaining your condition and recommending a gradual warm-up?
PATIENT: A note? Yes. That would be… helpful. Very helpful. The young man… he’s very enthusiastic. A little too enthusiastic, maybe. He wants me to… run and slide and… jump. A note would be… good. Explaining things. A gradual warm-up… yes. That sounds… sensible. So… am I… cleared? Officially? To try? That's all I need to know. Can I go now? Before the young man… gets impatient. And before my knees… get too stiff. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Bartok. This explains things to the coach. And yes, you are cleared to try. Just listen to your body and take it easy. I wish you the best of luck at the tryout. Please come back and see me if you experience any worsening pain or have any concerns. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good time!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will… try. And I will listen to my body. And I will come back… if needed. Good day, Doctor. Good day to you. .
