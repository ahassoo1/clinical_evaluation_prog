DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my skin. It’s… yellowing. Quite yellow, actually. I believe it has something to do with my liver, the doctor I saw before mentioned something about… hepatitis, was it? It’s all a bit muddled, honestly. I just want it sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis, you say. Right. And how long has this… yellowing been occurring, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say precisely. I haven’t been keeping very good track, I’m afraid. It started subtly, and then… well, it became more noticeable. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Subtly. Yes, well, “subtly” isn’t terribly useful for a medical assessment, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize, Doctor. I truly do. It just… faded in, you see. Not a sudden change, more of a… a gradual shift in color. I wish I could be more precise. Is there a specific timeframe you need? Perhaps if you told me why you ask, I could try to remember better?
DOCTOR: The why is because accurate timing is… crucial, Ms. Durig. It helps differentiate between various conditions. But very well. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this… discoloration?
PATIENT: Oh. Crucial, yes, I understand. Symptoms… let me think. Well, I've been rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And… my stomach hasn’t been quite right. A bit of discomfort, but nothing terribly severe. And I've lost my appetite, yes. Everything tastes… bland. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, stomach discomfort, loss of appetite… all rather non-specific, aren’t they?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I'm afraid I don’t have a very good grasp of medical terminology, Doctor. I simply tell you what I experience. Is there something specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you asked about something else… I’m not sure what would be helpful. I'm sorry for being… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, with all due respect, I need you to provide the information, not the other way around. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, dark urine, or pale stools?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's… a lot all at once. Let me see… nausea, yes, a little. Not often, but it happens. Vomiting, no, not recently. Dark urine… I hadn't noticed, no. And pale stools… I don’t regularly… inspect my stool, Doctor. I apologize. Is that a necessary part of the examination? It feels rather personal.
DOCTOR: It's necessary to get a complete picture, Ms. Durig. It's simply a visual observation. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Travel… no, not recently. Not at all. I haven’t left this town in… well, it’s been years, I think. Decades, perhaps. I don’t have the… energy for travel anymore. No, I haven't been anywhere. Just here, at home. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Any history of… let’s just say, risky behavior?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness me. Doctor, I… I hardly think that's appropriate. I'm a 77-year-old woman! I assure you, my life has been… quite settled for a very long time. I don't understand why you're asking such a question. I’m quite offended, actually. I'm here because my skin is yellow, not to… well, it’s simply improper.
DOCTOR: Very well. I apologize if my question was… indelicate. Let's move on. Do you drink alcohol, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh. Alcohol… very occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. Nothing more. I don't consider myself a drinker, no. It doesn’t agree with me terribly well, to be honest. Is that… relevant? I feel as though we are circling around and around.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Palpate… yes, I suppose so. I do hope it won't be… unpleasant. I’m rather frail, you see. Is there anything I need to do beforehand?
DOCTOR: Just lie flat. And try to relax. Hmm. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Liver is slightly enlarged, firm. Splenomegaly also present. I'll need to order some blood work. Liver function tests, complete blood count, and a hepatitis panel.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… yes, alright. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? You seem… concerned. Is my liver very bad? I just want to know what’s happening. I don’t understand all these… terms you’re using. Spleno… whatever you said. It sounds frightening. Perhaps you could simply tell me, in plain English, if I am very ill?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I’m not going to speculate until I have the lab results. Your liver is enlarged, and there’s some tenderness. This could indicate a number of things, including, but not limited to, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or even… something more serious. We need to rule things out systematically. I'm going to have the nurse draw the blood now. Please remain here, and I'll review the results as soon as they become available. I'll also have her schedule a follow-up appointment for next week. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Cirrhosis… whatever that is. Oh dear, oh dear. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
