DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want baby. We… old now. She say maybe need help to make baby. I… not so sure what help is. We just want to know… is possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you're wondering about the possibilities given your ages. That’s perfectly reasonable to explore. Just to clarify, how old is your wife, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ah… wife… she is… sixty-two, I think. Sixty-two or sixty-three. My memory… not so good these days. We been married long time. Very long time. She good woman. But… time pass, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time does pass. Okay, so your wife is around sixty-two or sixty-three years old. And you mentioned you're also… well, let's just say you've both lived full lives. That’s good information. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a little bit about your wife’s overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. She… she okay. She walk good. She cook good. Sometimes… sometimes she forget things too. Like me! But… no big sickness. She go to doctor sometimes for… for check-ups. But nothing… serious. She take pills for… for blood, I think. Blood pressure? Something like that. She tell me, but I forget. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Manuel. It's completely normal to forget details. We can figure things out together. So, she sees a doctor regularly and takes medication for her blood pressure, you think?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Blood… pressure. She say it is important. She take small white pills. Every morning. And… sometimes she feel tired. Very tired. But she try to do things. She garden. She like garden very much. She grow tomatoes. Very good tomatoes. Is that important for… for baby making? Being tired?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the gardening – staying active is always helpful. And yes, feeling tired could be a factor. Fatigue can sometimes be related to underlying health conditions that might affect fertility, or it could just be part of getting older. Just to be thorough, has your wife ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… diagnose… that is… when doctor say what is wrong? I… not sure. She maybe had something with… with water? When she young. She go to hospital. I was not there. She say it was nothing serious. Just… water. And… she had babies before. Two babies. Long time ago. Before she meet me. She not have babies with me. Is that… important? The old babies?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful information, Manuel. The fact that she had babies previously is important. It means she’s been able to get pregnant before, which is a good sign. And the issue with “water” when she was younger – could you describe that a little more, if you remember?
PATIENT: Water… she say… something with kidney? Maybe kidney. She was sick. Very sick. She stay in hospital for… long time. She not remember much. She say doctor fix it. She okay now. But… she worry. She worry it make trouble for new baby. She say her body… old now. Not like before. I just want to make her happy. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so there was a kidney issue in the past, and she’s concerned that might affect her ability to get pregnant now. I understand. It's good she’s thinking about these things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to check her medical records, if that's alright with you. That would give me more information about the kidney issue and any other health concerns she might have. Do you know where she usually sees her doctor?
PATIENT: Doctor… hmm. She see doctor near her house. On Main Street. Small office. Blue building. She go there every few months. I not go with her. She say I worry too much. She say it is just check-up. I… I not know name of doctor. She tell me, but… I forget. Sorry. Is okay to look at records? If she let you? I not want to make trouble.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Manuel. It's perfectly alright. Having her permission is important, and we can definitely look into getting her medical records. I’ll ask her to sign a release form. While we're talking, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Me? Ah… I okay. I walk good. I eat good. My wife cook very good food. Sometimes… sometimes my knees hurt. When it rain. Old knees. And… I get tired too. But… I not go to doctor much. I not like doctor. I think… I think I have a little… cough. Sometimes. But… not serious. Just old man cough. I mostly just… sit and watch TV. And help my wife in the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're generally healthy, a little knee pain and a cough, but mostly you stay active helping your wife. Good to hear. To get a better idea of what's going on, and to see if there are any factors that might make it difficult to start a family, I think it would be helpful to do a few basic tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? Like… like needles? I not like needles. And… what if tests show something bad? I just want to know if… if baby possible. I not want trouble. What kind of tests you think? Is important tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Manuel. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. I assure you, we'll only do what's necessary. The tests I’m thinking of are relatively simple. For you, a blood test to check your general health and hormone levels. And for your wife, we’d want to do a blood test as well, and possibly an ultrasound to look at her uterus and ovaries. The ultrasound doesn't involve needles, it's like a picture. These tests will help us understand if there are any underlying health issues that might affect fertility. And it’s important to remember that many couples have trouble starting a family, and there are often treatments available to help. We’ll discuss all the options if we find anything that needs attention. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood test… and picture… for my wife… okay. Okay, I think. But… no needles for me, please? I really not like needles. And… you promise you explain everything? If tests show something bad? You explain all options? And… you be gentle with my wife? She get scared easy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Manuel. No needles for you, I promise. And yes, I absolutely promise to explain everything clearly, no matter what the tests show. We’ll discuss all the options in detail, and I will be as gentle as possible with your wife. We want to make sure she feels comfortable and informed every step of the way. Let's start by getting her permission to access her medical records. Then we can schedule the tests for both of you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… okay. Good. Medical records… she will need to sign something? You have paper for that? She keep things very tidy. She always has paper. Maybe she already have paper for doctor. She is very organized woman. We come back next week? To do tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, she'll need to sign a release form, allowing me to access her records. I do have the form here. And yes, next week sounds good. We can schedule the appointments then. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions for me right now, Manuel?
PATIENT: No… not right now. I think… I think you explain everything good. I tell my wife. She make decision about tests. She is… smart woman. Very smart. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I feel… better now. Less scared. Just want to make her happy. That is all. I think… I think that is all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Manuel. It was nice meeting you. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. Feel free to come back next week with your wife, and we'll take it from there. Take care, and I'll see you then. .
