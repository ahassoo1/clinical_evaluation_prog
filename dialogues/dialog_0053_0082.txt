DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... travel. I need... shots? For travel. My wife... she liked travel. Before... It's for a trip. I think. Somewhere warm. Not like here.
DOCTOR: Right. Travel vaccinations. Okay. And where are you planning to go, if you do remember?
PATIENT: Warm... beach. Lots of sun. I... don't know the name. She planned everything. I just... went. It was… before. Does it matter? I just need what I need to go.
DOCTOR: It does matter, actually. Different regions require different vaccinations. And some require them well in advance. Look, I understand this is… difficult. But even a general idea helps. Was it in the Americas?
PATIENT: Americas? Maybe. Big planes. Lots of water. She liked the water. I think… islands. Small islands. Not… Canada. Definitely not Canada. Is that important? What kind of shots are we talking about? Are they bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, small islands... Americas is a start. And yes, the specifics are important. As for the shots… they're not exactly pleasant, but they're necessary to protect you from diseases common in those areas. It’s far better to get them than to risk getting sick. Have you had any vaccinations recently, or in the past?
PATIENT: Shots... when I was little? Maybe. I don't remember. My wife... she took care of all that. Doctors and... papers. I just... worked. I build things. Planes. Not good with remembering things like shots. Are you sure you need to know about before?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a baseline, Mr. Tayar. Knowing what you've already had prevents unnecessary injections. And frankly, if you haven’t had a tetanus booster in ten years, that’s something we need to address regardless of your travel plans. Let’s try this: do you have any medical records at all?
PATIENT: Records? No. She had them. Everything was on her... computer. After... it all went away. I just have... this apartment now. And work. I don't have papers. I told you. She did everything. Are the shots expensive? I don't want to spend too much money.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can proceed without prior records, but it means we'll need to be more cautious. As for cost, it depends on which vaccinations are required. You have private insurance, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Insurance. She set that up too. Blue… something. It has a picture of a mountain. It covers… things. I hope. She said it would. Will it cover all the shots? For the warm place? I don't have much money left. After… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just quickly verify your coverage with Blue Cross Blue Shield. One moment... Alright, it looks like you have fairly comprehensive coverage for vaccinations. However, it's always best to check with them directly regarding pre-authorization, especially for travel-related immunizations. Now, let’s focus on this “warm place”. To give you the best advice, could you perhaps recall anything else about it?
PATIENT: Um… white sand. Very white. And… palm trees. Lots of them. And the ocean was… blue. Really, really blue. And hot. It was very, very hot. People… spoke a different language. Not English. She… she could speak a little. That’s all I remember. Is that enough? To get the shots? I just want to go somewhere warm. To… remember her.
DOCTOR: Okay. White sand, palm trees, blue ocean, non-English speaking… That narrows it down somewhat. It sounds like you were likely in the Caribbean or potentially some of the smaller islands in the Pacific. Given your lack of vaccination history, and to err on the side of caution, I'm going to recommend a series of vaccinations. Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster are standard. We should also consider Yellow Fever, depending on the specific island. And because of the potential for mosquito-borne illnesses, I’ll recommend a prescription for malaria prophylaxis. Does that sound… alright?
PATIENT: So many… things. Malaria? Prophylaxis? What does that even mean? I just want… a few shots, not a list. Is it very expensive? And will they make me sick? She always said I get sick easily. Maybe… maybe I shouldn't go. Maybe it’s too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar, let’s slow down. Prophylaxis simply means preventative medication – something to prevent you from getting malaria. It’s a common precaution in areas with mosquitoes. And yes, there are potential side effects with all medications, but they're usually mild – nausea, stomach upset, things like that. We’ll discuss them in detail. As for cost, let me run those specific vaccinations through your insurance. It will likely be a co-pay, but I can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. We don’t have to do everything at once. We can start with the most essential vaccinations and see how you feel. I understand this is overwhelming. We can take it one step at a time. Would you like me to start by checking your insurance coverage?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Check the insurance. And… maybe just the most important ones. For now. I just… I need to get away. Even if it’s… trouble. But not too much trouble. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see… Okay, it looks like your plan covers Hepatitis A and Typhoid with a co-pay of $75 per dose. Tetanus is fully covered. However, Yellow Fever is considered a travel-related vaccine and requires pre-authorization. And the malaria prophylaxis… that's a bit more complicated. It depends on the specific medication, and your plan may have restrictions. Let's focus on getting you protected against Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Tetanus for now. We can get those administered today. And I'll submit the pre-authorization for Yellow Fever. As for the malaria prophylaxis, I'll need a little more information about the potential island destinations. Perhaps you have some pictures, or a travel itinerary, even if it’s incomplete?
PATIENT: I… I think this is it. She took it. It's her… on the beach. And… I think the name of the island was… Bora Bora? Maybe. It's small. Lots of water. And… fancy hotels. Will this help?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful. Bora Bora… That’s in French Polynesia. Knowing the specific location allows me to provide much more accurate recommendations. Okay, given that you’re planning a trip to Bora Bora, I strongly recommend the Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Tetanus vaccines, as we discussed. And for malaria prophylaxis, I’d recommend Mefloquine. It’s effective for that region, but it does have some potential side effects – vivid dreams, nausea. We’ll need to discuss those in detail. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergic… I don't think so. She always asked me that. But I can't remember. I get… dizzy sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Is that an allergy? I don't know. I've never really been sick. Except for… after she… I just get tired. A lot. Is that something?
DOCTOR: Dizziness when standing up and fatigue aren't typically allergies, but we should note them. It could be related to dehydration or other factors. We can discuss that further. Since you don't have any known medication allergies, we can proceed with the vaccinations. Before we do, I want to review the potential side effects again, and ensure you understand the risks and benefits. And I'll give you a handout detailing everything we've discussed. Are you comfortable with proceeding with the Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Tetanus vaccines today?
PATIENT: I… I think so. If you think it’s best. I just want to go. To remember her. So… yes. Let's do it. But please… be quick. I don't like needles. And… tell me if it will hurt a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. I understand your apprehension. The nurse is excellent, and we'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It’s a small pinch, and it’s far less unpleasant than the potential consequences of getting sick. Let me just prep the consent forms and the vaccination record. The nurse will be right in to administer the injections. And I’ll be here to answer any questions you may have. Just try to relax, and breathe deeply. You're doing this for a good reason.
