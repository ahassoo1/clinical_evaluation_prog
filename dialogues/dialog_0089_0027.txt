DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s my stomach. Food keeps… coming back up. It's a nuisance, really. And it burns. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be brief. “Coming back up” – do you mean vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? Is that what you call it these days? Yes, alright, vomiting. Though it’s not violent, if that makes a difference. It just…reappears. Like a bad tide. And it tastes awful, naturally. Now, are we getting somewhere or...?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. And thank you for clarifying it’s not forceful. When did this start happening, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… well, a few months now, I suppose. Not constantly, mind you. It comes and goes. More when I eat certain things, I’ve noticed. Rich foods, mostly. You know, proper foods. Not this… bland stuff everyone's eating now. It started maybe around spring, give or take. Why does it matter exactly?
DOCTOR: It matters because the timing can help us narrow down the cause. So, around springtime, and it’s worse with rich foods. Can you describe what the vomit looks like?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not going to get into the specifics of what comes up, alright? It’s food, obviously. Partially digested. Sometimes it's more liquidy, sometimes… less so. It’s unpleasant, that’s what it is. And it burns on the way up. Do you need a sample or something? Honestly, this is all a bit ridiculous. I’ve had a stomach my whole life, I think I know when something’s wrong with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I apologize if the questions seem unnecessary. We just need to gather as much information as possible. The burning sensation is important. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the vomiting – nausea before the vomiting, for example, or any pain in your abdomen or chest?
PATIENT: Nausea? Sometimes, yes. A bit queasy beforehand. But not always. And pain… well, a bit of discomfort, a tightening. Mostly just the burning. It feels like… like acid, naturally. Look, I'm a practical man. I suspect it's just too much good food, too little exercise. Is that allowed as a diagnosis or are you going to want to run a bunch of tests? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. It could be related to diet and activity level. But the burning sensation makes me want to rule out other possibilities. Have you had any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No. I eat just fine. Always have. Steak, sausage, pierogi… never had a problem getting food down. It’s getting it to stay that’s the issue. Are you suggesting I have some sort of blockage? Because I assure you, there is nothing blocking anything. I’m a robust man. Used to physical work, you know. This is probably just indigestion. A temporary thing. Can we just get something for it and be done with this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It will only take a few moments. Then we can discuss some potential options. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke too hard. I bruise easily, you know. This skin isn’t what it used to be. And honestly, if you find anything, I want a second opinion. I don't trust these young doctors these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. I notice a little tenderness right here, in the upper part of your stomach. No significant swelling or masses. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely serious, but given the burning sensation and persistent vomiting, I do want to consider a few possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any problems with medication. I take a little something for my blood pressure, that's all. Lisinopril, I think it is. But that’s it. And don't start suggesting some weird diet. I need to eat proper meals, not rabbit food. I’m a Polish man, after all. We like our meats and potatoes. What are you thinking, exactly? Some kind of ulcer? Is that it? Because I assure you, I'm not stressed. Not particularly, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril noted. An ulcer is one possibility, yes, but there are others. Given your age and symptoms, we should also consider gastritis, or perhaps even a hiatal hernia. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A simple blood test to check your overall health, and a test called an endoscopy – where a small camera is used to look at the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You want to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No. That sounds barbaric. Unnecessary. I told you, it’s just too much good food. I’ll cut back a bit. Maybe. But I am not letting you stick a camera down my throat. Not happening. What else can you suggest? Surely there's medication? Something to neutralize the acid? Give me something for the burning, and I'll manage the rest myself. This is ridiculous. Really, ridiculous.
