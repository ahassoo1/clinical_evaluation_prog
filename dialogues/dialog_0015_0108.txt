DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it’s…well, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that. Happened a couple times now. Thought I’d best get it checked before I end up…you know. Weak. And I ain't got time for that.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. A couple of times now. Alright. Can you describe what the bleeding looks like?
PATIENT: Describe it? What kinda description you want? It's…red. Obviously. Not bright red all the time, sometimes it's darker. Like…coffee grounds, I guess. That’s what my…well, nevermind. It comes up when I, uh, you know. And sometimes just…on its own. It's not a little bit, either. Enough to worry a man. And I ain't easily worried. I’ve seen things.
DOCTOR: Coffee grounds, you said. That’s…concerning. And it happens with bowel movements and spontaneously?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Look, I don’t need a lecture on what I should be doin’, alright? I work hard, I eat what I can, and sometimes things just…happen. It ain’t like I'm enjoyin’ this. It's happenin' when I go to the bathroom, and then other times…just outta nowhere. Like this morning. Had to practically run to the…well, you get the picture. And it’s makin’ me feel awful. Weak and dizzy. More than usual, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, this bleeding?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started…probably about a month ago. Maybe six weeks. At first, it was just a little bit, barely noticeable. I figured it was somethin’ I ate. But then it got worse. More frequent. And, like I said, bigger. Now it's…regular. And it's got me thinkin' somethin's seriously wrong. I'm not one to bother doctors unless I have to, you understand? I got things to do. Real things.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month to six weeks, progressively worsening. Do you have any pain associated with this, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, Doc. More like…crampin’. A real bad twistin' in my gut. Comes and goes. And sometimes, when it’s real bad, I get kinda…nauseous. Sweaty, even. It ain’t like a sharp pain, you know? More like everything inside is just…tied in a knot. And it makes me tired. Real tired. And frankly, I’m too old to be dealin’ with this.
DOCTOR: Cramping and nausea alongside the bleeding and fatigue. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits other than the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Yeah, kinda. It's... looser than it used to be. More often, too. I ain't one to talk about this, Doc, but…I gotta go more times a day, and it ain't solid, if you catch my drift. It's... watery, sometimes. And harder to…well, you know. It's embarrassing, frankly. Never had trouble with that before. Always been regular as clockwork, 'til this started.
DOCTOR: I understand this isn't easy to discuss, Mr. Gentz, but this information is important. So, loose, more frequent stools, sometimes watery... And you mentioned this started around the same time as the bleeding?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much around the same time. Started subtle, everything did. A little bit of blood, a little bit looser…didn’t think much of it. Then it just…kept gettin’ worse. Look, I ain't the type to sit around and worry, Doc. I just wanna know what's wrong and what I gotta do to fix it. I got a business to run. People rely on me. This ain't exactly somethin’ I can just ignore. And frankly, I don't have insurance. So whatever this is, it better not be somethin' expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz, both about your health and the financial implications. Based on what you've described—the bleeding, the change in bowel habits, the cramping and fatigue—this requires further investigation. We need to rule out several possibilities. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and a rectal exam. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now hold on a minute… You're gonna…look at that? Look, I appreciate you tryin’ to figure things out, Doc, but I gotta be honest, that ain't somethin’ I’m comfortable with. I don’t even know you. And frankly, I’ve seen enough in my life without someone pokin’ around down there. Is there somethin' else we can do? A test? A scan? Anything? I’m not sure I like this one bit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your discomfort, but a rectal exam is a crucial part of evaluating the source of rectal bleeding. It allows me to check for abnormalities and assess the extent of the problem. It’s a quick procedure, and I assure you, I will be as gentle and professional as possible. However, without it, I cannot adequately assess your condition and provide a proper diagnosis. We can certainly discuss further testing after the exam. A stool test to check for blood, for example, or potentially imaging, but those tests are often used to confirm a diagnosis, not to make one. I strongly recommend we proceed with the physical exam. Are you willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, you make a good point. I don’t like it, but I understand. If it’s gotta be done, it’s gotta be done. But I’m tellin’ ya, if it’s uncomfortable, you let me know. I ain’t one for holdin’ back. And I want you to explain everything afterwards. Everythin'. What you found, what it means, and what we gotta do next. No sugarcoatin'. Deal?
DOCTOR: Deal. I appreciate your willingness, Mr. Gentz. I will explain everything thoroughly afterward and ensure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll need you to lie on your side, and I’ll perform the rectal exam. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort or pain. If you’ll lie down on the table, we can begin.
