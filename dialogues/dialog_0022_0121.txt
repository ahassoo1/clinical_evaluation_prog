DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… dry eyes, mostly. Been that way a bit. Not sure what to do about it. Don't like how scratchy they feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. That scratchy feeling can be quite bothersome. And how long have you been noticing this dryness, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a while now. Maybe… a couple months? Hard to say exactly. Things kinda blur together when you get older, you know? Not getting any younger. It comes and goes, mostly worse when it's windy outside.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, things do tend to blend together. A couple of months, okay. And it’s worse on windy days – that’s helpful to know. Do you feel like anything specifically triggers it besides the wind?
PATIENT: Not really that I've noticed. I work outside, cement work. Dust, sometimes. But I wear glasses, try to keep it out. It's just... dry. I put drops in sometimes, the kind you get at the store. They help a little, but not for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, cement work outdoors, and you wear glasses which is good. And over-the-counter drops help temporarily. Do you remember the name of the drops you've been using?
PATIENT: Um… geez. I think… Refresh? Maybe? Little blue bottle. I get 'em at the drugstore. Don't pay much attention to the names, just grab what looks right. They're for dry eyes, that's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Refresh drops, that’s helpful. And they provide some relief, but it doesn’t last. Besides the scratchiness, do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just… feels like grit in 'em sometimes. Makes it hard to see real clear when I'm working. Makes the cement look… blurry, you know? And I blink a lot. Probably 'cause they're dry.
DOCTOR: Okay, grit sensation and blurry vision, especially when working. And increased blinking. Have you noticed any redness or discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: No, not really. They don't look red. And no… nothing coming out of 'em. Just dry. Plain dry. I wish I knew what to do about it. It's just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No redness or discharge, just dryness and the gritty feeling. Let’s do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright with you. It’ll help me get a better idea of what might be going on. I’ll use a light and a few instruments, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. Don't think it'll bother me. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do, you know? Not trying to be rude, just… don't want to sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I understand. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, I'm just taking a look at the outside of your eyes now… I notice a little bit of mild dryness around the lids, but no significant redness or swelling. Now I’m going to shine a light in your eyes. Let me know if it’s uncomfortable at any point. Okay, the corneas appear clear, but they are a bit dry. Now, I'm just going to check your tear production. I'll gently place a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid to see how much moisture is produced when you blink. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt.
PATIENT: Alright. Feels a bit weird, yeah. Like a little tickle. Just get it done. Hope you find somethin' out. My eyes just feel… old. Probably just old eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pipolo. That's all the quick tests I need for now. The Schirmer test shows your tear production is a little bit lower than what we’d like to see, which supports the diagnosis of dry eye. It’s common as people age, and with your line of work, the dust and wind can certainly contribute. It doesn't necessarily mean "old eyes," but your eyes are having trouble staying adequately lubricated. We can try a few things to manage this. First, we can switch to a different type of artificial tear, one that’s a little thicker and lasts longer. Systane Ultra is a good option. Also, I'd recommend using lubricating ointment at night to keep your eyes moist while you sleep. Do you have any allergies to eye drops or any other medications?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies that I know of. I don't take nothin' regular. Just… get tired, sometimes. Systane Ultra, you say? Okay, I can try that. Sounds alright. Anything else? I'd like to get goin' if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, good. Systane Ultra is a good starting point. In addition to the drops and ointment, I’d also recommend trying to shield your eyes from the wind and dust as much as possible when you’re working. Wearing wraparound glasses or goggles can help. I'm going to write you a prescription for the Systane Ultra and recommend the lubricating ointment. We can also discuss a humidifier for your bedroom if that’s something you’d be interested in, especially during the drier months. I'll also give you some information about dry eye syndrome and tips on how to manage it. If your symptoms don't improve with these measures, or if they get worse, please come back and see me, and we can explore other options, potentially referring you to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Wraparound glasses, okay. I got some, kinda. The ones I wear now ain't real tight. Maybe get some better ones. Humidifier… nah, don't think so. I'm good. Just the drops, I guess. And better glasses. Thanks. Can I go now? Getting kinda tired standin' here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pipolo. Here’s the prescription for the Systane Ultra. And here’s some information about dry eye syndrome and how to manage it. Remember to use the drops as directed, and consider getting some tighter-fitting wraparound glasses. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to come back. You can go ahead and get going now. Thank you for coming in today, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks. Good day to you too. Hope them drops work. Getting kinda scratchy just talkin' about it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I hope they provide some relief as well. Take care, Mr. Pipolo!
