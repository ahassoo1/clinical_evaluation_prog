DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kyron Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, is it? Hmm. Right. Well, it’s about a letter. A letter I need for… a pet. Yes, a pet. Something about needing proof, you know? For… ownership. Honestly, it's all a bit of a fuss, if you ask me. People and their rules. I can’t even remember who needs it, precisely. It’s just… a letter.
DOCTOR: A letter, alright. For pet ownership… I understand. It can be frustrating dealing with paperwork. Just to clarify, is this a new requirement, or have you had this pet for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Yes, definitely a while. Not new at all. I’ve had… well, I think it’s been over a year. Maybe two? Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? It’s a lovely creature, really. Very… demanding. Though, honestly, I don't recall what kind it is exactly. It’s small. And fluffy. Does that help? People are always asking about it. A lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right, small and fluffy. And demanding, you said. Hmm. Do you recall why they need this letter, Deloris?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not a bit. Something about… a building? Or a rental place? They were being very particular. All sorts of forms and requirements. I just wanted to get it over with. Honestly, all these rules… it's probably just some nonsense to make things difficult for everyone. I told them I had a doctor, so here I am. Wasting my time, if you ask me. Though, you seem very nice, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. So, this is for a rental property. Do you know if there are any specific details they requested on the letter?
PATIENT: A rental property… yes, that sounds right. They definitely mentioned something about rules and regulations. Let me think… Oh! They wanted to know if the… creature… was up to date on its… shots. And… something about its temperament. Yes, temperament! They were very concerned about temperament. Though honestly, it’s a perfectly well-behaved… thing. Mostly. They were making a lot of fuss about it being a potential… danger. Honestly, it’s smaller than my shoe!
DOCTOR: Okay, vaccination status and temperament for a small pet. Do you happen to know what kind of pet it is?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, Doctor, this is embarrassing. I really should know this. It’s… furry. Very, very furry. And it makes a… a sort of chirping sound. Not like a bird, though. More… squeaky. It likes to be held. And it eats… little pellets. Or maybe seeds? Honestly, my niece helped me pick it out, and she did most of the remembering. I just… liked the way it looked. Is that a good enough description? It’s very… demanding, as I said. Very. I swear, it has me wrapped around its little paw. Though, to be fair, it is very cute.
DOCTOR: Okay. Does it have a tail?
PATIENT: Oh! A tail… yes! It does. A small one. Very fluffy, of course. It wags it when I give it treats. Or… maybe it wiggles? Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering these things. It’s just… a small, furry creature with a tail. It’s not a big tail, mind you. Definitely not a cat tail. Much smaller. And… it has whiskers. Of course it has whiskers! What kind of creature wouldn’t have whiskers? Honestly, the whole thing is a bit much, if you ask me. You'd think it was a lion, the way everyone is fussing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. Has this little creature had any vaccinations since you've had it?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… hmm. My niece said something about needing to take it to a special… place. A pet place. For… poking. Yes, poking! She said they needed to poke it with something to keep it healthy. I think it was just one visit, though. Maybe two. I honestly don't remember. She handled all of that. I just provide the… accommodation. And the treats, of course. It likes little sunflower seeds. Does that help? Honestly, the whole thing is a bit of a blur. You’d think I’d remember, wouldn’t you? But I have so much going on. It’s just a small animal, really. Not like it’s going to bring down the building.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you have a small rodent – most likely a hamster or gerbil. It received some vaccinations through your niece. To fulfill the request for the letter, I can write a statement confirming that your pet is under my care and has received some preventative care. However, I'm unable to provide detailed information about the specific vaccinations or temperament without more records. Would you like me to proceed with a general letter stating that the animal is under my care?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A hamster or gerbil… yes, that sounds about right. Honestly, I wouldn’t know the difference. And yes, a general letter would be wonderful. Just something to get them off my back. Honestly, the fuss over a little animal… it’s ridiculous. Yes, please, Doctor. A general letter. That would be perfect. Thank you so much. You've been very patient with my… memory. It’s just not what it used to be. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Deloris. I'm happy to help. It’s perfectly alright. I'll have this printed for you in just a moment. While I’m doing that, do you have any other concerns about your health today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. That’s all, Doctor. Just the letter. Really. Honestly, I don’t want to take up any more of your time. You’ve been very kind. It's just… a lot of fuss over a little animal, if you ask me. Thank you again. Truly.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This should suffice for their requirements. And honestly, you haven't taken up any of my time at all. It’s my job to help, and I’m glad I could assist you. If anything else comes up, or if you do remember any further details about your pet's care, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day, Deloris. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Honestly, you’ve been a lifesaver. I appreciate it. Yes, a wonderful day to you too. Goodbye!
