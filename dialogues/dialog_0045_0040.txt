DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Billman. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Comes and goes, mostly on my right side. And… I keep getting water infections, it seems. They tell me it’s something to do with my kidneys. It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side pain and recurrent water infections… and you said they mentioned your kidneys?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The other doctor – Doctor Sharma, back in town – she said something about… well, lots of little cysts on them. Polycystic, I think she called it. It's a mouthful for an old man like me. It doesn't really feel like anything's wrong most of the time, just this pain and needing to go to the bathroom a lot.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… right. I see some notes here from Dr. Sharma confirming that diagnosis. And you're experiencing right-sided pain and frequent urination. Now, when you say frequent urination, can you tell me how often that is?
PATIENT: Well, it's not constant, you understand. But I find myself going to the bathroom… oh, every couple of hours, maybe? Sometimes more if I drink a lot of water, which is a bit of a worry, needing to drink more and go more often. It disrupts my afternoon nap, mostly. And the pain… it comes on suddenly, a sharp ache. It doesn’t last too long, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And this pain… is it radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating? Oh… does that mean spreading? Well, sometimes it feels a bit… in my back, on the same side. Not all the time, but when it's really bad, yes, it goes around to my back a bit. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It’s not a nice pain, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Right, radiating to the back. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… Well, sometimes it’s a bit cloudy, I think. And… occasionally, a little bit of blood. Not a lot, but enough to notice. That’s what keeps sending me back to the doctor, to be honest. The blood. It worries me. Is that… is that normal with this kidney business?
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine and blood… no, that's not ideal, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good you're paying attention to those things. We need to investigate that further. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I want to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then we’ll order some lab work – a urinalysis to check for infection and blood, and a blood test to assess your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A physical exam and some tests… alright. Go ahead, then. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, eh? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Espinueva. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, I'm just going to press around here. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Starting on your left side… any pain there?
PATIENT: No, nothing there, Doctor. Ah, but there… yes, a little tender there. Not awful, but… I feel it. A bit of a dull ache, really. It's where the pain usually is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your right flank. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Sounds normal so far. I’m not hearing anything concerning. Now, let's get those lab tests ordered so we can get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll have the nurse draw some blood and collect a urine sample. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Blood tests and a urine sample… alright. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Do I need to fast for the blood tests? I do enjoy my morning tea, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. No food or drink – except for water. So, no morning tea, I’m afraid. It can affect the results. We need an accurate reading to get the best assessment. The nurse will explain everything clearly when she comes in to draw the blood. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else?
PATIENT: No tea… A small sacrifice for good health, I suppose. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. This pain… it’s been worrying me a bit, to be honest. But I trust you’ll do your best.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. We'll get to the bottom of this. We’ll take it one step at a time. The lab results should be back within a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, severe back pain, or inability to urinate, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fever, chills, bad back pain… or trouble going to the bathroom. I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing what’s happening, and what to look out for. Now, I suppose I should go and avoid breakfast, then?
DOCTOR: Exactly. No food or drink except water. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. I’ll see you in a few days to go over the results. If you have any questions before then, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva. And try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will try not to worry. Have a good day to you too, and thank you again.
