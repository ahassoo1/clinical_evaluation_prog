DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 35 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. It... it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need to... arrange some paperwork, for the future. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should... should something happen. I think it's called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to inquire about it. I apologize for the vagueness. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re interested in discussing advance care planning – establishing a POLST or Advance Directive. That's… prudent, certainly. Though, generally, patients come to me with a specific medical concern. It’s a bit unusual to present solely for paperwork. Are you currently experiencing any health issues that have prompted you to consider this now?
PATIENT: Oh. I... I hadn’t considered that might be unusual. No, not exactly. There isn’t a specific ailment, no. It was… a friend suggested it. She said it was important to have these things in order, just in case. She recently went through something… difficult, with her mother. And it made me think. I don't recall why I specifically need one right now, only that I feel I should have it. It's... frustrating, this lack of clarity. Perhaps it was a feeling, more than a reason. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling a sense of… preparedness is warranted, despite not having an acute medical issue. While I appreciate proactive thinking, these documents are most valuable when informed by a clear understanding of your current health status and potential future needs. It seems… premature to establish these directives without a firm grasp of why you feel they are necessary. Ms. Buoniconti, with respect, it would be more responsible to first conduct a thorough medical assessment to identify any underlying concerns that might influence these decisions. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: That… that makes a great deal of sense, actually. I hadn’t thought of it that way. I suppose I was trying to get ahead of things without… without knowing what things were. It’s terribly inefficient, isn’t it? Yes, please. A thorough assessment would be… very helpful. I apologize for the trouble. It seems I’ve put the cart before the horse. Where shall we begin?
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s better to be thorough. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that’s difficult. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course. Routine check-ups, things of that sort. But I don’t… I don’t recall being diagnosed with anything specific. I believe I had a bout of bronchitis once, many years ago. And… I think my blood pressure was a little high during a pregnancy, but it resolved after. But chronic… no, I don’t believe so. I apologize again for being so vague. Is there a record of my previous appointments available somewhere? Perhaps that would be more helpful?
DOCTOR: We can certainly review your records, Ms. Buoniconti. It appears you’ve had appointments with several practitioners over the years. I see a history of routine check-ups, as you mentioned, and a notation of gestational hypertension during a pregnancy in 2015. It also notes a single instance of acute bronchitis in 2010. Aside from those, the records are surprisingly sparse. Do you recall if you've ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… No… no, I don’t believe so. Not for anything significant. Perhaps for the birth of my child, but it was a straightforward delivery, as far as I recall. Nothing requiring a lengthy stay. I… I truly apologize for the lack of information. It's as if my past is… fragmented. It’s quite unsettling, to be honest. I do remember having a wisdom tooth removed as a teenager, but that was an outpatient procedure. Should I be concerned about this? Is it normal to have such poor recollection?
DOCTOR: It is somewhat unusual to have such limited recall of medical events, Ms. Buoniconti. While it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, it’s worth exploring. Have you experienced any other memory difficulties – trouble with short-term recall, disorientation, changes in personality or behavior?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that you mention it… yes. There have been instances. Small things, mostly. Forgetting where I placed my keys, repeating questions… I often find myself searching for words, even in simple conversations. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. And yes, my friend has commented that I seem… distracted, lately. More so than usual. It's just… chalked it up to stress. Being divorced and working… it's a lot. Do you think this is… serious?
DOCTOR: Given your history of limited recall, coupled with recent memory difficulties and your friend’s observations, it’s prudent to investigate further, Ms. Buoniconti. It's too early to draw any conclusions, but these symptoms could indicate a variety of underlying issues, ranging from stress and sleep deprivation to more significant cognitive concerns. We need to perform a more thorough neurological assessment, including a cognitive screening test. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever is necessary. I… I want to understand what’s happening. It’s unsettling to feel… disconnected, like pieces are missing. A neurological assessment sounds… sensible. When can we schedule that? And… will it be painful?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're proactive, Ms. Buoniconti. The assessment is non-invasive and shouldn't be painful at all. It involves a series of simple questions and tasks to evaluate your cognitive function – memory, attention, language, and problem-solving skills. I can schedule you for a comprehensive neurological evaluation with Dr. Chen – she's our specialist in cognitive disorders – next Tuesday at 2 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2 PM… yes, that will work perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It’s… comforting to feel listened to. Now, regarding the Advance Directive… should we postpone discussing that until after the assessment? It seems… rather premature to make those decisions at the moment.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s the responsible course of action. We need a clear understanding of your cognitive status before discussing advance care planning. Let’s focus on the assessment first. We’ll revisit the topic of the Advance Directive once we have a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve addressed all my concerns, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I… I feel much better knowing we’re taking this seriously. I’ll see you Tuesday at 2 PM then. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. I’ll see you then as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day.
