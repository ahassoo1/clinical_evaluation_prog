DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Panjoj, is it? Yes, yes... I'm here for… a check-up, I think? Something about being cleared for… work? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They sent me over. Just trying to get this over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We'll get through this as efficiently as possible. “Cleared for work” suggests a recent change in employment or a return to work after some time off. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Employment... Right. Well, I do a bit of ushering, mostly. And sometimes ticket taking at the theater. Lobby stuff, you know? It's not… a steady job, exactly. More like filling in here and there. I've been doing it for… a long time, I suppose. Not recently, though. That's probably why I'm here. It's been a while. I honestly can't recall why they need clearance now, though. Someone called me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ushering and ticket taking at the theater. That’s good to know. And it sounds like this is related to resuming that work after a period of absence. Let’s see… I'm pulling up your records now. It appears you haven’t been seen here before, Mr. Krahn. That’s alright. We'll just need to gather some information. To start, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have – anything at all that a doctor should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, well… that makes sense, doesn’t it? New place and all. Let me think… Medical conditions… Hmm. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a while back, but that was ages ago. Nothing major, just old age, I guess. And… I think I had high blood pressure once? Or maybe someone told me I did. It’s all a bit… blurry. I really don’t keep track of these things. I mostly just… try to keep going. Is that helpful? I apologize, Doctor. I'm not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s very common for details to be a little fuzzy over time, and you’re not at all difficult. It’s helpful to know about the knee trouble and the possible high blood pressure. We can certainly look into both of those. Do you recall when you were told about the high blood pressure – roughly what year?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the year? That’s… tricky. It must have been… a long time ago. Before my divorce, definitely. So… before 2015? Maybe even earlier. I really can't say for sure. I didn't have a regular doctor back then, just went when something really hurt. I don't remember any medication or anything. Honestly, I mostly just ignored it and hoped it would go away. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Mr. Krahn, but it’s not uncommon. We’ll check your blood pressure today to see where things stand. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was… a very long time ago. And I spent a night in the hospital once with a bad flu, but that wasn’t a surgery, of course. Just felt awful. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay active, even if my knees complain a bit. Is that all you need to know for now? I’m starting to feel a little… distracted.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Tonsils as a child and a night in the hospital with the flu. We’ll make a note of those. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, none at all. Not a single one. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I'm honest. I prefer to just… tough things out. Maybe some pain reliever for my knees sometimes, but nothing regular. Just over-the-counter stuff, when I really need it. Is that okay? I really wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. I feel like I'm just rambling. .
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Mr. Krahn. It’s good to know you’re not on any regular medications. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
