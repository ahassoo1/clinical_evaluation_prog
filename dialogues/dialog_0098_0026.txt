DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's...well, it's something about being awfully tired. Just awfully tired, you know? It comes and goes. And the young man at the lab said something about...numbers? Something about my numbers being off. I don’t rightly remember what he said, though. All this poking and prodding...it's a bit much for an old woman, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. It can be a lot. Being tired, and then having lab results to try and decipher…it’s no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed. And you're right to ask about those numbers. Let’s try to sort things out. When you say “comes and goes”, can you tell me a little more about how it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like every single day, you see. It'll be...a few good days, where I can potter about the garden, maybe do a bit of cooking for my husband. Then, bam, just wiped out. Can barely lift a pot. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Makes it hard to even hold a teacup sometimes. And it's not like I've been doing anything strenuous. It’s just…there. Mostly after I’ve been on my feet a bit, I reckon. Though honestly, I can't always say for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, good days where you can manage your usual activities, then periods of fatigue, particularly in your arms and legs, and it seems to be worse after being on your feet. It sounds frustrating when it’s unpredictable like that. You mentioned it affects holding a teacup…is that weakness, or more of a tremor, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not a shaking, dear. It’s…like they just don’t want to lift. Heavy, you know? Like I’m trying to lift stones instead of a nice, empty cup. And it's not all the time, mind you. Some days they're fine. It's just… when this tiredness hits, everything feels harder. Even thinking feels harder, if I’m honest. But that could just be my age, I suppose. My husband says I repeat myself a lot now, too. But he's always teasing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a feeling of heaviness, particularly when fatigued, and it affects your arms and legs. And you've noticed it can make thinking more difficult as well. It’s good you have a supportive husband, even if he does tease! It's important to note all these changes, whether it's fatigue, heaviness, or difficulty with memory. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have my Medicare, of course. Old age comes with a few aches and pains, doesn't it? I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, the doctor told me years ago. Nothing major, just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. And my blood pressure…it runs a little high sometimes, I think. I take a pill for that. A little white one. Can't remember the name of it, though. It’s…complicated, keeping track of everything, you see. I try my best. And I used to be very active, you know. A commercial diver, believe it or not! But that was a long time ago. Now, I mostly just garden.
DOCTOR: A commercial diver! That is amazing, Ardelle. That sounds like quite a life! And it's perfectly understandable that keeping track of medications can be complicated. Don't worry about remembering the name right now; we can look that up. So, you have arthritis in your hands, which causes morning stiffness, and you take medication for high blood pressure. Are there any other medical issues you've been diagnosed with, or any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Oh! I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. It was a dreadful pain, but the doctor fixed it. And…I think I had a cyst removed from my wrist once. Small thing. Nothing to write home about. Mostly it’s just the usual old lady ailments, dear. A bit of this, a bit of that. My husband does most of the remembering, to be honest. He’s very organized. I’m not, I’m afraid. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes, the tiredness… It's just wearing me down, you know? It makes it hard to enjoy things. Even gardening isn’t as much fun when you’re exhausted all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal and a cyst removed from your wrist. And it sounds like the fatigue is really impacting your quality of life, which is certainly something we want to address. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions—heart disease, diabetes, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I came to this country a long time ago, you see. From Bhutan. Lost touch with most of my family back there. My husband's family… they're mostly healthy, I think. His mother lived to be a very old age. But she was very active, always on the go. Can’t really recall any specific illnesses. They weren't ones for talking about such things, you see. Mostly just…kept to themselves. My sister had some trouble with her joints, I think. But she lived far away, and we didn't see each other much. It’s all a bit hazy, if I’m honest. I try not to dwell on the past too much. It just brings up sad memories. Now, about this tiredness…is there anything that makes it better? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available, which is perfectly understandable. And you’re right to focus on what’s happening now. You asked about what makes it better…Well, sometimes a good nap helps, if I can manage it. But it doesn’t always work. And resting doesn’t seem to do much, either. It just…comes and goes on its own. It’s very frustrating. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…let me think. I don’t believe so. Never had any trouble with anything, really. I used to be able to eat anything, but my appetite isn’t what it used to be. It’s hard to enjoy food when you’re tired all the time. And the smells… sometimes they bother me. Strong smells, you see? Like perfumes or cleaning products. They make me feel a bit dizzy. But that could just be my age, too. I’m not as strong as I used to be. Now, about this tiredness…do you think it could be something serious? I don’t want to be a bother, but it’s just…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you don’t have any allergies. And no, you're not a bother at all. It’s my job to investigate things like this, and it's important that you express your concerns. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your heart, lungs, and just take a look at your overall strength and reflexes. It'll just be a quick check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it’s best. Just…be gentle, please? My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. And I get a bit dizzy sometimes, as I mentioned. But I suppose it can’t hurt. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My husband is expecting me home for tea, you see. And he makes a lovely cup of Earl Grey. But do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just…be careful. And let me know if you see anything…serious. It’s just… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I will be very gentle. And we will take things slowly. Let me know immediately if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable at any point. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Now, can you please hold out your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a murmur, you say? Is that bad? My husband’s mother had a murmur too, I think. But she lived to be a very old age, as I mentioned. She was a very strong woman. Alright, here are my arms. They feel a bit…weak today. Not as strong as they used to be. I used to be able to lift all sorts of heavy things, you know. When I was a commercial diver. But that was a long time ago. Now, everything feels… harder. Be careful, please. Don’t pull too hard. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just checking your strength. It is a bit weaker than expected, especially in your arms, but you have full range of motion. I notice some slight tremors in your hands as well, even when relaxed. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon with age. Overall, it seems we have some decreased strength, slightly diminished reflexes, and a murmur, as well as some tremors. It’s good we’re getting a clearer picture. Now, do you mind if I quickly check your feet and ankles for swelling?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes they do feel a bit puffy at the end of the day. But I thought that was just from being on my feet too long. It’s hard to get around the garden, you see. Lots of bending and stooping. Alright, you can check them. Be gentle, please? They’re a bit sensitive. And don’t poke too hard. My husband says I shouldn’t complain so much, but it’s hard, you know? Everything aches. It’s just… getting old. Is that all you need to do? I’m starting to feel a bit tired now. Perhaps a cup of tea would help. My husband makes a lovely cup of Earl Grey, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a little bit of swelling in your ankles, which is consistent with being on your feet for extended periods. And yes, that's all the physical exam I need to do for now. Based on everything you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, we need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and weakness. The murmur and tremors also warrant further investigation, although they may not be directly related to your tiredness. I want to order some blood tests to check for things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. We’ll also do a urine test. And I’d like you to have an EKG done to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests. Is it something serious? I don't like going to the lab. All those needles and poking...It makes me anxious, you know? But if you think it's necessary... I suppose I can manage. But please, no unnecessary poking. And could you explain the tests to me? What exactly are you looking for? My husband likes to be informed, you see. He worries about me. And I don't want to worry him unnecessarily. An EKG…that sounds rather frightening. Does it hurt? Is it something serious? Perhaps a cup of tea would calm my nerves. My husband makes a lovely cup of Earl Grey, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about the tests, Ardelle, and I want to assure you we're doing this to get to the bottom of what’s causing your fatigue. We’re not assuming anything is serious, but these tests will help us rule out various possibilities. The blood tests will give us a broad overview of your overall health. We’ll be checking for anemia—that’s a low red blood cell count which can cause tiredness. We’ll also look at your thyroid levels, as an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue and weakness. And we’ll check for vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin D and B12. Finally, we’ll look at markers of inflammation. The urine test is just to rule out any kidney problems. An EKG—electrocardiogram—is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t involve any needles, just some sticky pads placed on your chest. It helps us see if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm. It’s a very common test, and it doesn’t hurt at all. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. If you say it’s necessary. All those terms… anemia, thyroid, vitamin deficiencies… It’s a bit much for an old woman to remember, you know? But I trust your judgment. And I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not good news. No needles, you say? That’s a relief. My husband always worries about me getting poked and prodded. He says I bruise easily. So, no needles, just sticky pads… and then we talk about the results. And then what? Will I have to take pills? Or have more tests? I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. And I really don’t want to have more tests. I just want to feel like myself again. Being tired all the time is wearing me down. Now, about this Earl Grey…do you think I could have a cup after this? I’m starting to feel faint. Perhaps a biscuit, too? My husband makes lovely biscuits, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. Let’s take things one step at a time. We’ll start with these tests, and then we’ll see what the results show. If needed, we can discuss medication options, but we’ll certainly consider all other options first. And if we do consider medication, we’ll start with the lowest possible dose and monitor you closely for any side effects. And yes, absolutely, you deserve a cup of tea and a biscuit after all this. Please, let me write you a note for the lab with clear instructions and a reminder to take it easy. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you feel unwell at any point. Once you have the results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we’ll discuss them in detail. We’ll work together to get you feeling like yourself again. Now, would you like me to help you get settled before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, dear. Yes, a little help would be appreciated. My legs are feeling rather weak. And I do tend to get a bit dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Thank you for being so patient with an old woman like me. It’s nice to know someone is listening. My husband always says I worry too much. But it’s hard not to worry when you’re tired all the time. So, I go to the lab, then come back to see you with the results… And then we talk about it. Alright. I think that’s all I can remember for now. Perhaps a cup of Earl Grey will help me think more clearly. Thank you again, dear. You’ve been very helpful. Now, about that tea…could you perhaps point me in the right direction? And please, don’t hesitate to call if you see anything…serious. It’s just… worrying, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I'm happy to help. And please, don't worry. We'll take things one step at a time. My staff will be happy to direct you to the waiting room and offer you a cup of tea. And again, please call if you have any concerns at all. It was a pleasure meeting you today. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
