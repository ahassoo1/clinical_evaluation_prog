DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx, but you can call me Kaelyn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, results. Just the results, if that's alright? I'm a bit pressed for time, actually.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. We can focus on the results then. Just to be sure I have everything correct, are you referring to results from tests done here at the clinic, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: Here, at the clinic. Last week, I think it was the 19th? I had blood work and… something with a machine, lying down? It was all pretty quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see it here. Blood work on July 19th, and a CT scan. Let’s go through these together. Starting with the blood work… everything looked quite good, actually. Your complete blood count was normal, your electrolytes were within the standard range, and your kidney and liver function tests were all normal. There were no immediate concerns there. Now, the CT scan… it did show a small nodule in your right lung. It's approximately 7 millimeters in diameter. Do you have any history of lung issues, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: A nodule? Seven millimeters… that doesn't sound good. No, no history of lung problems, and I've never smoked a day in my life. I spend most of my time organizing things, honestly, not… breathing in anything bad. Is that… serious?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you’ve never smoked. A nodule doesn’t automatically mean something serious, but it does require further investigation. Many lung nodules are benign – meaning not cancerous – and often caused by old infections or inflammation. However, because of its size and to rule out anything concerning, we need to monitor it. The typical course of action would be a follow-up CT scan in six months to see if there’s been any change in size. Are you comfortable with that plan, or would you prefer to discuss other options?
PATIENT: Six months… Okay. That sounds… reasonable, I guess. Other options? What are the other options? I’d like to know everything before deciding, if you don’t mind. It's just... waiting six months feels like a long time to just wait.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about waiting, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to know all the possibilities. Other options include a PET scan, which can help determine if the nodule is metabolically active – meaning, is it growing and using energy. It’s more sensitive than a CT scan, but also involves a small dose of radiation. Another option, and often the most definitive, is a biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of the nodule for examination under a microscope. This can be done through several methods, including bronchoscopy – inserting a thin tube with a camera into your airways – or a needle biopsy guided by CT scan. However, a biopsy isn’t always necessary, especially if the nodule is small and you have no symptoms. It also carries some risks, such as bleeding or infection. Considering your age and your lack of smoking history, we can start with the six-month follow-up CT scan, and if there's any growth, we can then consider a PET scan or biopsy. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Ugh. A biopsy sounds… awful. And radiation… no, thank you. Six months and another scan… okay. Yes, that sounds best. The least invasive thing. Just… make a really clear note in my file about not wanting anything more unless it changes. I really don't want to be pressured into anything I'm not comfortable with. And… when can I schedule that follow-up? The sooner, the better, honestly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ve made a very clear note in your file about your wishes regarding avoiding further intervention unless there are changes in the nodule’s size or characteristics. We will absolutely respect that. Let me see… The radiology department has availability on September 12th at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: September 12th… yes, that’s fine. September 12th it is. Okay, I think that’s everything? Unless… is there anything else I need to do? Tests, paperwork… I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so. We've scheduled your follow-up CT scan for September 12th. The radiology department will contact you with any specific preparation instructions, but generally, it’s just a standard scan. I’ll also send you a summary of our discussion today and the note I’ve added to your file, so you have it for your records. Here's the number to the clinic if you have any questions before then. I appreciate you coming in today, Kahrin. We'll monitor this closely, and I'm here to answer any concerns you may have. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for… being so clear. And for listening about not wanting anything extra. I really appreciate that. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kahrin. I’m glad I could help. We prioritize patient comfort and informed decisions here. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. .
