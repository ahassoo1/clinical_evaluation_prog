DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today because I am planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They’ve asked for details… things a woman my age should have documented, I suppose. I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time, and I don’t have a regular physician currently.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. A lot of cruise lines are doing that now, just to be safe. So, we'll just go through a fairly standard check-up and get everything documented for you. No worries at all. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m 45 years of age, as you can see. I’m of Scottish descent, and I believe I’m generally quite healthy. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of sherry on special occasions. I do enjoy a good walk, though, and try to keep active. I'm widowed, you see, and keeping busy helps. I do not have any major complaints, if that makes sense. No aches, pains, or… alarming symptoms. I lost my husband three years ago now, and it was quite sudden. That was… difficult, naturally. But I am recovering well, all things considered.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s good to hear you’re doing as well as you can, and keeping busy is a wonderful way to cope. That's all very helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a shock, to say the least. As for medical history… let me see. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, quite a common thing back then, I believe. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree – a rather silly accident, really. Other than that, nothing significant, no. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I have had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, things of that nature. But nothing serious as an adult. I’ve never been hospitalized, except for the tonsil removal, and that was many years ago. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly the sort of thing I need to know. Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother lived to a good age, she was 87. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years, and some trouble with her eyesight, but otherwise she was quite robust. My father died younger, at 72, from a heart condition, I believe. He smoked for many years, which I suspect didn’t help. I have one brother, he lives in Inverness, and he seems to be in good health, as far as I know. He's a sheep farmer, so he's always very active outdoors. No history of anything particularly concerning on either side of the family, if that’s what you were wondering.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Knowing the family history can sometimes be helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies. I've always been able to eat whatever I’ve been offered, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I have taken various over-the-counter remedies for colds and headaches over the years, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. I’ve never had a rash, swelling, or any difficulty breathing after taking anything. It’s one of those things I’ve never had to worry about, thankfully. My brother, however, is allergic to bee stings. A rather nasty reaction, I believe. But I am perfectly fine in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies to worry about for you. Right. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I believe in keeping things as natural as possible, if you understand me. I don’t take any prescription medications, and I rarely take over-the-counter remedies, unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps a paracetamol for a headache, but that's about it. I certainly don’t take any herbal supplements or vitamins. I try to get all the nutrients I need from my diet. A good, balanced diet and plenty of fresh air, that’s my approach. I did used to take a calcium supplement a few years ago, but I stopped when I realized I was getting enough from dairy products.
DOCTOR: That’s sensible. Okay. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I keep quite active. I enjoy long walks, particularly along the coast. I live in a small village, so there’s plenty of fresh air and beautiful scenery. I do a bit of gardening, and I enjoy reading. I also volunteer at the local library one afternoon a week. It keeps me busy and it’s a lovely way to meet people. I don’t smoke, as I mentioned, and I rarely drink alcohol. I eat a balanced diet, mostly fresh produce and lean protein. I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible. I sleep reasonably well, usually around seven or eight hours a night. I don't have any particularly stressful hobbies or commitments, so I’d say my lifestyle is fairly relaxed and healthy. Is there anything specific you were hoping to know?
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy indeed. No, that gives me a good overview. Now, just to finish up, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’ll only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I have no objections at all. A quick check sounds sensible. I understand it’s all part of the process. Please proceed when you’re ready. I’ll do my best to remain still. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could just sit up here for me. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Okay, that's 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Pulse is 72, nice and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Skin appears normal in color and temperature. No rashes or lesions noted. Reflexes are normal. Everything sounds and looks good. A slightly elevated blood pressure is something we can monitor, but overall, you appear to be in good health.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you for your thorough examination. I do sometimes worry unnecessarily, I confess. So, what does this mean for my cruise, then? Do you need to fill out any forms for the cruise line? I brought along the paperwork they sent, just in case.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It’s completely understandable to worry, that’s part of my job – to put your mind at ease. Yes, let me take a look at the forms. Okay, this is fairly standard. It looks like they need a general health assessment, confirmation of vaccinations – specifically tetanus, influenza, and potentially COVID-19 depending on the cruise itinerary – and a statement that you have no known contraindications to travel. I'll note that your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it doesn't preclude travel. I recommend you continue to monitor it and discuss it with a primary care physician when you have a chance. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment here if you’d like to check it again in a few months. Here you go. This should be sufficient for the cruise line. I’ve included my contact information if they require any further clarification.
PATIENT: That’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to fill out the forms so thoroughly. I’m not currently looking for a regular physician, but I will certainly keep your name in mind should that change. Perhaps a follow-up appointment in a few months wouldn’t be a bad idea, just to keep an eye on my blood pressure. Is there anything else you would advise me to do before my cruise? Any vaccinations I should consider? Or perhaps any preventative measures I should take? I’m very excited about the trip, and I want to ensure I’m fully prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help. That’s a sensible idea about the follow-up. It’s always good to be proactive. As for vaccinations, it really depends on the itinerary of your cruise. Where are you planning to travel?
PATIENT: Oh, apologies, Doctor. I didn’t mention that. We are going on a Mediterranean cruise. Starting in Rome, then onto Greece – Santorini and Mykonos – and finishing in Istanbul. It’s a rather ambitious itinerary, but I’ve always wanted to visit those places. It’s a two-week trip, departing on the 15th of September.
DOCTOR: Ah, a Mediterranean cruise! Wonderful. Okay, for that itinerary, I would recommend ensuring you’re up-to-date on your routine vaccinations – tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio. Hepatitis A and typhoid are also recommended for travel to those regions, as they can be contracted through contaminated food and water. And depending on your activities, you might want to consider a rabies vaccination, particularly if you plan on being around animals. I would recommend discussing these options with a travel clinic if possible. They can provide you with the most up-to-date information and help you determine which vaccinations are right for you. Other than that, I would recommend practicing good food and water safety, protecting yourself from the sun, and being aware of your surroundings. And most importantly, have a wonderful time!
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor, thank you. I will certainly look into visiting a travel clinic. I hadn't even considered rabies, but it’s always best to be prepared. And I will be sure to practice good food and water safety, and protect myself from the sun. I do enjoy a good sun hat, thankfully. I think that answers all my questions. I really appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with me. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably. How much do I owe you for today’s consultation and the completed paperwork?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. No problem at all. The consultation fee is £85, and there is a small charge of £10 for the completed paperwork. So, that comes to a total of £95, please. We accept cash and card. And have a truly wonderful cruise! Don't hesitate to contact me if anything comes up before your trip.
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you are. Keep the change. It’s the least I can do for your kindness and thoroughness. Thank you again, Doctor. I will certainly keep your number, just in case. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: Thank you so much, that’s very kind of you. You too, Velda. Enjoy your cruise and have a wonderful time in the Mediterranean! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
