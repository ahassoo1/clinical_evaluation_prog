DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it’s a bit strange, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by the sun lately. Like, really bothered. Much more than usual, and it’s… photosensitivity, I think my friend called it. Everything just feels too bright, and my skin gets upset easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. Photosensitivity is a good way to describe it. It’s helpful you’ve noticed a change from your usual tolerance. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this skin upset?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a rash, exactly. More like… redness, and it feels hot. And sometimes it itches a little. It happens pretty quickly after I've been outside, even just for a few minutes. It’s mostly on my face and neck, but last week it was on my hands too after I was gardening. It feels different than a sunburn, though. A sunburn hurts right away, this is…more irritating, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Arbin. It sounds quite bothersome. And it’s good you're able to differentiate it from a typical sunburn. To clarify, when you say "quickly," could you estimate how long after sun exposure this redness and itching usually start?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Usually within, oh, maybe 30 minutes to an hour after being outside? Sometimes even faster if it's a really bright day. Like, if I’m walking to the store and the sun is beaming down, I can feel it starting almost right away. It’s definitely gotten worse over the last couple of months, that's for sure. I used to be able to be out much longer without any issues.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arbin. That’s helpful information. And the fact that it’s worsening over time is important. Now, let's go through a bit more of your history, if you don't mind. Have you noticed anything else associated with this sensitivity?
PATIENT: No problem at all, Doctor. Let me see… hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. No fever, no headache… just the sun bothering me. Oh! Actually… maybe I’ve been a little more tired than usual, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just… life, you know? I've been keeping busy since… well, since my wife passed. I haven't really connected the tiredness to the sun thing, though.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Arbin. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that you've been busy and perhaps not focused on subtle changes. Fatigue can be a symptom associated with various conditions, so it's good to note. To continue, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. I take a daily multivitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re acting up. They bother me more in the cold weather, usually. Oh, and I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. My regular doctor prescribed it a few years back. That’s all, really. Nothing new. Medicare covers it all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way. My wife wasn't so lucky, she had hay fever something awful every spring, but I never had to worry about that. It's always been the sun for me, just…more lately. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Arbin. Thank you for that information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course. And I broke my arm once when I was playing football. Other than that, just the usual colds and flu. My regular doctor did mention I have slightly high cholesterol, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about yet. He wanted me to watch my diet, but I haven’t been very good at that, to be honest. I keep meaning to, but… things happen.
DOCTOR: Understood, Arbin. And no surgeries or hospitalizations other than the broken arm?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing else. Just the arm when I was a teenager. It healed up fine, never bothered me after that. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Which makes this whole sun thing even more confusing, you know? It’s not like I’ve changed anything in my life recently, other than…well, you know. Since my wife… It’s just been different. But I don’t see how that could cause this.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion, Arbin, and it's completely valid to feel that way. Sometimes, changes in our lives can manifest in unexpected ways. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And she had arthritis in her hands, which bothered her a lot when she got older. My father… he had a heart condition. He passed away when I was still pretty young, in his fifties. My sister is healthy as far as I know, she lives in Accra and we don't talk that often, but she seems fine. Nothing else major that I can think of. Just the usual stuff, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arbin. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll need to check your skin, blood pressure, and pulse. Then we can talk through the next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. I’m looking at your skin now. I notice some mild redness on your cheeks and the bridge of your nose, and a slight flushing on your neck. There's no obvious rash or blistering. Your hands have some mild redness as well, particularly on the backs. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Your pulse is 76 beats per minute and regular. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing in the exam, the photosensitivity is concerning. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. A few possibilities include a medication reaction, a skin condition like polymorphic light eruption, or, less commonly, an underlying autoimmune condition. To help narrow things down, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a bit scary, honestly. Autoimmune condition? But I understand, you need to rule things out. Yes, blood tests are fine. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to get this sorted. It’s… unsettling, you know? Being so sensitive to the sun, it makes you feel… vulnerable. But yes, please, do the tests. Are they covered by Medicare?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Arbin. It is unsettling, and you're right to want answers. An autoimmune condition is just one possibility, and we'll explore all the others first. The tests will help us rule things in and out systematically. And yes, thankfully, the tests are covered by Medicare. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your organ function, and a test for antinuclear antibodies, which can help identify certain autoimmune conditions. I’ll also want to check your vitamin D levels. I’m writing the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sun exposure as much as possible. Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available and develop a plan based on what we find. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Avoiding the sun… that’s going to be tough, but I can manage. I'll definitely do that. Hmm… I was just wondering, could it be the Lisinopril? I've been taking it for years, but I’ve heard some medications can cause sensitivity to the sun. I don’t want to stop taking it without talking to my regular doctor, but… is that a possibility? And… what happens if it is something serious? I’m trying not to worry, but… you know. It’s hard.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Arbin, and it’s good you’re thinking proactively. Lisinopril can cause photosensitivity as a rare side effect, although it's not common. It's definitely something we'll keep in mind and discuss with your regular doctor. We absolutely won't make any changes to your medication regimen without their input. If the tests do reveal something serious, it’s important to remember that many conditions are manageable with treatment. We’ll discuss all your options thoroughly and develop a plan that's right for you. We have excellent specialists we can refer you to if needed, and we’ll be with you every step of the way. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and seeing what the results tell us. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this moment?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little bit better just knowing we’re looking into it. Avoiding the sun and getting the tests done… that’s a good plan. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I guess I’ll head down to the lab then. If they need any information from you, who should they contact?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Here’s a slip with my contact information and the lab’s details. They can contact me directly if they have any questions. I’ve also noted your wife’s passing in your chart, so everyone is aware of your situation. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any further questions or concerns before your lab appointment or after you receive the results. I want to assure you, we’ll figure this out together. Take care of yourself, Arbin, and please stay out of the sun as much as possible. I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will. And I will stay out of the sun. Thank you again. .
