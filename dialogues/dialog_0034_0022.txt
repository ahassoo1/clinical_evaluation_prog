DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Seil, you say? A nice name. Yes… well, my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want much food anymore. Not like before. It’s just… not good. I don’t… remember when it started, exactly. A little while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I understand you’ve been experiencing some changes with your stomach – it feels bigger, and you’re not as hungry as you used to be. That’s certainly worth investigating. When you say “big,” could you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… big like… a balloon, maybe? Not painful, just… full. And hard. Not always hard, but sometimes. I… I used to eat a good breakfast, you know? And a nice lunch. Now… just a little something. Tea is good though. Do you like tea, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I see. So it feels distended, or swollen, at times, and you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite. And it’s not necessarily painful, just uncomfortable. That’s helpful to know. And yes, I do enjoy a good cup of tea, thank you for asking. But let’s focus on what’s going on with you. You mentioned it’s been happening for "a little while." Could you try to recall if there was anything specific going on around the time you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific? That’s… hard. Everything feels like a long time ago, you know? I think… maybe after the winter? Yes, the cold winter we had. I stayed inside a lot. Not many visitors. I mostly watched the television. Oh, and I read a book! About… birds, I think. Was it birds? It all gets mixed up. I don’t… I don't know if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It's completely understandable that it’s difficult to pinpoint an exact time. Knowing it started around winter is still helpful. Staying indoors more and having fewer visitors could be relevant. Let's talk about other things you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh… you mean… going to the bathroom? Well… it’s not… regular. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. It’s… a bit of a problem, yes. Not very much comes out when I do go. And… sometimes it hurts a little. Just a little cramping. It's nothing terrible, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. McConnon. It’s good you’re letting me know about these changes. Irregular bowel movements, decreased stool volume, and some cramping are all important things to consider. Have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don't think so. No, I haven't seen any blood. I would remember that, wouldn't I? I try to be careful. It’s… a scary thought. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McConnon. And it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Not seeing blood is reassuring. Now, I'd like to ask about any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm… I haven't been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I think… I think my clothes feel a little looser. But maybe that's just old age, eh? It's hard to say. I don’t weigh myself anymore. Too much trouble. My scales broke a long time ago, and I never got around to replacing them.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. McConnon. It can be difficult to keep track without scales. Clothes feeling looser could be a sign, but it's not definitive. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s a long time ago. Let me see… the doctor used to tell me my blood pressure was a little high. Years and years ago. I took a little pill for it, I think. But I stopped taking it after a while. I didn’t like taking pills. And… I had a bad fall once, broke my wrist. But that healed up fine. I don't… I don't remember anything else. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but that was a long time ago, too. Everything feels so fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. High blood pressure in the past, and a broken wrist – that’s good information to have. It’s not uncommon for memories to become fuzzy over time. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of things like stomach problems, colon cancer, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh… family. That’s… hard to remember. My parents are gone now, a long, long time ago. I had a sister, but we didn't see each other much. She lived far away. I don’t… I don't remember them being sick. Not seriously, anyway. Maybe a cold sometimes. But nothing… nothing like this. It all feels so distant. I'm sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. You've provided a lot of helpful information already, and I understand it’s difficult to recall things from the past. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, or any allergies you may have.
PATIENT: Medications… No, I don't take anything regularly. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when it flares up. But I haven't needed it lately. And allergies… not that I know of. I used to like flowers, even though they smelled strong. I don't… I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I haven't had any reactions, ever.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. No regular medications, just occasional use of something for arthritis, and no known allergies. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your tummy, feel around gently, and check your overall health. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I want to feel better. Just be gentle, please? My old bones are a bit fragile.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I will be as gentle as possible. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem… a little quiet. And yes, they are definitely diminished. That could be a sign of slowed bowel activity. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Is this tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh… it’s a little cold. It tickles. And… yes, it’s a bit tender… here, on the left side. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And maybe… a little bit here, too, near my belly button. But not much. It's hard to say. It's all a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. The tenderness on the left side and near your belly button is helpful information. I'm also noticing some slight distension of your abdomen. I don't feel any obvious masses, but there is some resistance. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90, and your pulse is a bit slow at 68. Everything else seems within normal limits. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the examination, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate further. The decreased bowel sounds, abdominal distension, tenderness, and slight elevation in blood pressure are concerning. It could be a number of things, including constipation, a possible blockage, or something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests… they always make me nervous. Will they hurt? And… will they take long? I don't want to be poked and prodded all day. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon, and I’ll explain everything carefully. The tests I'm recommending are relatively simple. First, I’d like to order a complete blood count, or CBC. This will check for any signs of infection or anemia. Second, I want to do a metabolic panel, which will assess your kidney and liver function and electrolyte levels. And finally, I’d like to get an abdominal X-ray to see if there’s any sign of blockage or other abnormalities. The blood test will just require a small sample of blood from your arm. It usually takes just a few minutes. The X-ray is completely painless and non-invasive. It takes just a few seconds to complete. I know tests can be nerve-wracking, but they’re important to help us figure out what’s going on and get you the right treatment. I'll be with you every step of the way, and I’ll explain the results as soon as they're available. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. If you think it's necessary. I don't like it, but I want to feel better. Just… please be quick. And gentle. And explain everything to me… slowly. I don't understand all the medical terms. And… who will do the blood test? A nice nurse, I hope? Is it very expensive? I don't have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I understand your concerns completely. We will definitely take our time, and I will explain everything slowly and in plain language. You won't be rushed, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Yes, a very nice nurse, Nurse Davies, will be doing the blood test. She’s excellent and very gentle. She’ll explain everything to you as well. Regarding the cost, I'll have my assistant check with the lab and see what the charges will be. We can discuss payment options and see if there’s any financial assistance available. We don’t want the cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. I’ll write up the orders for the tests now, and then my assistant will come in to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… please don't keep me waiting too long. And tell Nurse Davies to be gentle. It’s all a bit overwhelming, you see. Old age is not for the faint of heart. Thank you, Doctor. For being so patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. And you are absolutely right – old age certainly has its challenges. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I'll let my assistant, Sarah, know to come in as soon as possible to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. I’ll also ask her to let Nurse Davies know to be extra gentle. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let me or my assistant know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you again for coming in today. I’m optimistic that we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon.
