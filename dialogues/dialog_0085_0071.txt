DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s about some shots needed… for a friend of mine. He’s hoping to get his papers to stay here, you see, and I believe some vaccinations are required. I’m just trying to help him figure out what all needs to be done. It’s a bit confusing, all these requirements.
DOCTOR: I see. You're helping your friend navigate the immigration medical exam requirements. That can be quite confusing, yes. I'm happy to help clarify what's needed. To start, do you know which forms he needs to complete – specifically, the I-693 form?
PATIENT: The I-693… hmm. I don’t recall the exact number, no. He just said something about needing a doctor’s visit and some shots before he can submit everything. He’s a quiet man, doesn’t like paperwork much, that’s why he asked me to come along. Is that form important? Should I be looking for it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Skarbek, but don't worry, we can figure this out. The I-693 is the Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record used for immigration purposes. It details the required vaccinations and a general health exam. Let me quickly check our system to see if we have any record of him as a patient already. If not, we'll need to get some basic information from him first. Do you have his full name and date of birth, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. His name is Elias Thorne, and he was born March 12th, 1968. He hasn’t been to your clinic before, as far as I know. He mostly keeps to himself. He’s… well, he’s been through a lot, and doesn’t trust doctors easily. That’s another reason he asked me to come with him. He felt more comfortable having someone he knew here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. No, I don’t see any record of Mr. Thorne in our system. That’s perfectly alright. We'll just need to get a bit of his medical history then. First, has he ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… He did have a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back, when he first came to this country. Needed some strong medicine for that. Other than that, he’s generally been a healthy man. He works hard, you see. Mostly physical labor, landscaping and such. He doesn’t complain much, even when he’s aching. He did have some trouble with his eyesight when he was younger, but he has glasses now, like me. He hasn’t seen a doctor regularly, though. Not since that pneumonia.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia a few years ago, and some history of vision trouble. That's good to know. Has he ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. He mentioned a small injury to his hand when he was a boy, working on a farm, but it didn’t require a hospital visit or anything like that. Just a cut that his mother tended to. He’s pretty resilient, that Elias. Always has been. He doesn’t like to bother people with his troubles, if he can avoid it. Is this information helpful? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: This is very helpful, Mr. Skarbek, thank you. Knowing his past medical history, even seemingly small details, is important. Now, does he have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me see… He did have a reaction to some sort of bug bite a few summers ago. Swelled up something awful. He doesn’t recall the name of the bug, and we didn't go to the doctor for it, just used some ointment from the store. Other than that, no, I don’t think he has any known allergies. He eats pretty plain, mostly. Nothing fancy. He’s a simple man, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, a reaction to a bug bite, but no other known allergies. And what about medications?
PATIENT: He doesn’t take any regular medications, Doctor. Not for anything. He might take something for a headache now and then, like aspirin or ibuprofen, but nothing on a daily basis. He prefers to tough things out, if he can. He doesn't trust those pills, he says. Too many side effects, he believes. He’s a bit old-fashioned that way. Does he need to bring anything with him next time? Like records or… something? I’m not sure what’s required.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No regular medications. Since he doesn’t have any records, we’ll need to proceed as if he hasn’t received any vaccinations previously. The I-693 form requires documentation of certain vaccinations – measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and hepatitis B. We can administer those here at the clinic, if needed. Before we proceed with vaccinations, I would like to perform a physical exam to ensure he is medically eligible for the immigration process. Would that be alright with you both?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A physical exam is a good idea. He might be a bit nervous, being poked and prodded, but he’ll cooperate. He wants to do this right, you see. He just… doesn’t like doctors much. As for the shots, well, if they’re necessary, then he’ll get them. He’s a strong man, he can handle it. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Or any paperwork I should fill out beforehand? I want to make this as easy as possible for him.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you, Mr. Skarbek. No, there's no paperwork you need to fill out beforehand. I’ll explain everything to Elias before we begin the exam, and he can let me know if he has any concerns. If you don't mind, let's get him settled on the examination table, and we can start with his height and weight. Then, I’ll listen to his heart and lungs, check his blood pressure, and do a general visual assessment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. He’s a bit self-conscious about his height, being a smaller man, so… try not to make a big deal of it, if you would. He’s very sensitive about that. Here we are. He’s ready when you are. He trusts you now, you see, having me here. I’ll stay close.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. I appreciate you letting me know. Hello, Elias. It’s nice to meet you. As Mr. Skarbek mentioned, we're just going to do a routine physical exam today to make sure you’re healthy and eligible for the immigration process. We’ll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick visual assessment. Everything will be quick and painless. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. Alright, let’s start with your height. Could you stand up straight for me?
