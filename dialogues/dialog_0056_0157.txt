DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see why I even had to come in. It's just a number, right? My husband says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, it's good you're getting it checked out. It is just a number, in a way, but it's a really important one. High blood pressure can lead to some serious problems if it's not managed. And even if your husband thinks you worry too much, it’s always best to be proactive about your health. Just to clarify, when did you find out about it?
PATIENT: The clinic called last week, after my regular check-up with Dr. Begay. Said it was a little high, but… honestly, I don't remember the exact number. He didn’t seem that concerned, just wanted me to come see someone here, for… a second opinion, I guess. I don’t really understand why I couldn’t just keep seeing Dr. Begay. He knows me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Sometimes a specialist consult is helpful to get another perspective, even if Dr. Begay is great – and I’m sure he is. We'll review everything he's done so far. Do you have any symptoms you've noticed – things like headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I feel perfectly fine. That's why I think this whole thing is ridiculous. I mean, I work a full day, I take care of the house… I don't have time to be sick. And if I did feel bad, I'd know it. I'm not… fragile.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Sometimes high blood pressure doesn't cause any symptoms at all, which is why it's often called the 'silent killer.' But even without symptoms, it's still important to get it checked and managed. Let’s get some baseline information. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never. I’ve always been healthy. My mother always said I had strong bones from working outside, and… well, she was right. I haven’t even had the flu in years. Honestly, I think they’re just trying to get more money out of people with all these appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Look, is this going to take long? I have to get back and finish prepping dinner. My husband likes it on the table by six, and he gets… particular if it’s late. I really don't understand what this visit is even accomplishing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. We’ll try to make this as quick as possible. Just a few more questions, then we'll take your blood pressure and see where things stand. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely none. My grandmother used to make all sorts of herbal remedies, and I was exposed to everything. I'm pretty resilient, you see. This whole thing feels like a waste of my time, honestly. Are you sure you can't just tell me my number and I can go?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t put anything unnatural in my body. My husband tried to get me to take something for… well, it doesn't matter. I told him no. I prefer to take care of myself naturally. Honestly, I think the stress of coming here is probably raising my blood pressure more than anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see no medication allergies or current medications listed here either. That’s good. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My mother's side, they were all… strong. Worked hard, lived long lives. My father’s side… less so. He had some… problems. But I don’t really talk about it. It’s private. And it doesn’t really concern me. I’m not like them. Honestly, I’m starting to get a headache. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can skip the detailed family history for now. Now, are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never touched one. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. It’s a disgusting habit. I wouldn't even let anyone smoke in my house. Honestly, I just want to know if my blood pressure is high, and if I can go home. This is a complete waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. That's good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Honestly? Barely any. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on the weekends, if my husband is having some. It’s mostly just water. I prefer to stay hydrated. Can we please just get to the actual blood pressure reading? I have things to do, you know. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Just a little bit of alcohol, mostly water. Okay, let’s take your blood pressure now. It will just take a few minutes. I’m going to have you sit here and relax for a bit while I get everything set up. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That is elevated. Now, this is just one reading, and things can fluctuate. But it’s high enough that we need to talk about it. Do you feel okay right now?
PATIENT: Elevated? See, this is exactly what I thought. Probably just from the stress of coming here. And the waiting, and all these questions. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Honestly, I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing. Now, can I go? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, but it’s important to take this seriously, even if you feel fine. A blood pressure of 148/92 consistently elevated is higher than the recommended range, and it can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order some blood work. It will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing to your high blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work? Absolutely not. I am not sticking needles in my arm for this. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. This is ridiculous. You're just trying to get more money out of me. I'm leaving. I don’t need your blood work, and I don’t need your opinions. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: Tasmia, please. I understand you’re frustrated, but ignoring high blood pressure can be very dangerous. I’m not trying to get more money out of you, I genuinely want to help you stay healthy. I can write you a referral to another doctor if you’d prefer a second opinion, but please, please don't just ignore this. Would you at least let me give you some information about lifestyle changes you can make – things like reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and managing stress?
