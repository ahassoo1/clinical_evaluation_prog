DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I need to get a card… for driving. A ride-share card, I think it’s called? Or maybe a taxi one? Something commercial, anyway. It’s… a requirement, you see. I want to get it done quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver's license requirement… I see. Though, typically that involves a more… comprehensive medical examination than a simple card. Are you referring to a license to operate a vehicle for hire, such as with Uber or Lyft?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Uber and Lyft… yes, that’s right! My grandson, he does that sometimes. He said I needed something… a medical check, to prove I’m still able to drive safely. I don't know about comprehensive... I just want to be allowed to do it. Is that what you mean? A check to see if I'm safe? I haven’t driven a lot lately, but when I do, I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Right. A medical evaluation to determine fitness for commercial driving. It is… prudent that these companies require such assessments. To properly evaluate your capacity, I will need to gather some information. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, or neurological disorders – that might impact your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, mostly. It doesn't bother me too much. Nothing else, really. No heart problems, no diabetes… I had a bit of high blood pressure once, but it went away with diet. My doctor at the time said it was just stress, you see. Is arthritis a problem? It doesn’t affect my steering, I assure you. I still have a good grip.
DOCTOR: I see. Arthritis can potentially affect range of motion and reaction time, although it sounds like it is well-managed in your case. To clarify, when you say “went away with diet,” did you discontinue any medication for your blood pressure, or was it simply resolved through lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Oh, it was the lifestyle changes. My doctor, Dr. Tanaka, he said to cut back on the salt, you see, and I did. And I started walking more. The blood pressure came down, and he said I didn't need the pills anymore. It was… twenty years ago, maybe more. I haven't taken anything for it since. Dr. Tanaka retired a while back, unfortunately. A very good man. He always had time to listen.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any other medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements – for any other health concerns?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It's called… Celebrex, I think. Helps with the aches, mostly in the mornings. And sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. Said I wasn’t getting enough sun. That’s it, really. I try to keep it simple, you see. No need to fill myself with things I don’t need.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've always been quite lucky, in that regard. My mother used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She made me try all sorts of things when I was little, just to see! No hives, no swelling, nothing. I can eat anything, thankfully. A blessing, that is. Though I don’t eat much red meat anymore. Too heavy, you see. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, to get a clearer picture of your overall health, I would like to ask a few questions about your recent medical history and lifestyle. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… my eyesight isn't what it used to be, naturally. I need glasses, you see. And I have a bit of trouble hearing when there's a lot of noise. But nothing drastic. I still manage. My balance is… okay. I haven’t fallen recently, if that’s what you mean. I walk carefully, you see. I'm not one for rushing around. Mostly, I’m just getting old. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: I understand. These are simply standard questions to assess your fitness to drive safely. Have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never have, really. I get a little warm sometimes, you see, if it's very hot. But that’s just… the heat. Nothing to worry about. I always make sure to stay hydrated, and I avoid being out in the sun too long. I'm very careful. Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite well for my age. It's just… getting older, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. This will give me a more complete picture of your current health status. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I understand you need to do your job. Just… try to be quick, if possible. I have an appointment later this afternoon. It's nothing important, but... I prefer not to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll keep it as efficient as possible. Please have a seat, and I will begin with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's check your pulse. 78 and regular. Vision is 20/30 in both eyes with correction. A bit diminished, as you mentioned. Now, I will test your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, I will perform a brief neurological assessment… Can you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can. There. Am I doing alright? It's a bit blurry without my glasses, you see. But I can see it, mostly. I used to be very good at puzzles, you know. Helps keep the mind sharp, my mother always said. Is this the end? I’m getting a little tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient for now. The eye movements are slightly slow, but within acceptable limits. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta. Based on this preliminary assessment, and your medical history, it appears you are generally in stable health. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your vision is diminished, even with correction. I would recommend a more comprehensive eye exam to assess the extent of your vision impairment. Also, I suggest monitoring your blood pressure at home and discussing any consistent elevations with a cardiologist. Given these findings, I will need to provide a written assessment to the ride-sharing company detailing my observations and recommendations. I cannot definitively clear you for commercial driving at this time without further evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? A cardiologist… and another eye exam? Is it… is it serious? Can I still drive, then? I haven't had any accidents, you see. And I only want to do it a little, to help out my grandson. He’s very busy. It’s just… a few hours a week. Is there anything… anything at all I can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, please do not be alarmed. "Serious" is a strong word. These are simply precautionary measures to ensure your safety and the safety of others. The ride-sharing company has specific requirements for medical clearance, and I am obligated to adhere to them. Regarding your ability to drive, I am not able to provide a definitive answer at this time. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without a complete evaluation of your vision and cardiovascular health. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive assessment and to an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye exam. Once I receive the results of these evaluations, I can provide a more informed assessment and complete the necessary paperwork for the ride-sharing company. In the meantime, I would advise against operating a vehicle for hire until we have a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. A cardiologist and an ophthalmologist. It’s just… a lot. All right. Very well. I’ll make the appointments. It’ll take some time, I suppose. My grandson will be disappointed, but… safety first, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. Even though it’s not what I wanted to hear, I appreciate you being thorough. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… can I go now?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. Thoroughness is paramount in these situations. No, there is nothing further required at this time. I will have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in approximately four weeks, once you have received the results of your evaluations. You may go now. Do drive carefully. And please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any new or concerning symptoms in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
