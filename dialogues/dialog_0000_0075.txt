DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness. Even though I’m using the machine every night, I’m still awfully sleepy during the day. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I thought this would fix it, you know?
DOCTOR: A machine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For my sleep apnea. The doctor – Dr. Chen, a few years back – said I needed it. It’s one of those things you wear over your nose… a CPAP machine, I think he called it. It pumps air in while you sleep. I’ve been pretty good about using it, almost every night, but it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A CPAP, right. And how long have you been using the CPAP, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been about three years now, maybe a little longer. Three and a half, perhaps? I started using it regularly in the spring of 2022, I believe. I remember because the weather was starting to warm up nicely. I always associate things with the weather, silly habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed since you started using it?
PATIENT: Changed… well, let me see. At first, it was awful! Couldn’t get used to the mask, felt claustrophobic. But I got a different mask, a smaller one, and that helped a lot. And the first few months, I felt… better. Definitely less snoring, my wife – ex-wife now, sadly – used to complain about that. But the tiredness… it crept back, gradually. Maybe a year ago or so? It's hard to say exactly. I haven't changed anything about the machine itself, though. Same settings, same mask.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how would you describe this tiredness, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like being physically tired, you know? I don’t feel weak or anything. It’s more… a heavy feeling. Like I haven't quite woken up, even after a full night’s sleep. I find myself nodding off in the afternoon, especially when I’m reading or watching television. It’s a bit embarrassing, really. And it makes it hard to concentrate. I used to be a very sharp thinker, teaching history and all, but these days… it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: You said you teach history?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I was a professor at the community college here in town. Retired now, a few years back. Ethnic and cultural studies, mostly. I loved it, truly. All sorts of fascinating people and stories. But even before I retired, I noticed the tiredness starting to affect my work. Hard to give a good lecture when you're fighting to stay awake, you know? Good students, though. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… not really, not that I've noticed. I don’t have headaches, no chest pain, nothing like that. I do wake up with a dry mouth sometimes, probably from breathing through my mouth with the mask on. And maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the morning. But that's about it, honestly. Oh! And I do get up to pee once or twice a night, but I’ve always been a frequent bathroom visitor, even when I was younger. Old age, you know? Everything starts to… loosen up.
DOCTOR: You said you don't have headaches... but you've been experiencing daytime sleepiness and fatigue for years. That can be related. And a dry mouth can contribute to headaches. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your throat and sinuses. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I hadn’t thought about the headaches specifically, no. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. And you’re right, it could be related to the dry mouth. I just hadn't connected the dots, I suppose. Yes, of course, I can stand up. Careful now, old knees, you know? A little creaky, but still functioning. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning for your age. Lungs sound clear. Throat looks a little dry, some mild redness, but nothing significant. Sinuses are tender to the touch on both sides. Hmm. Tenderness in the sinuses. And you mentioned dryness... Have you had any recent nasal congestion or sinus infections?
PATIENT: No, not recently. Nothing I've noticed, anyway. A little sniffle here and there with the change of seasons, but nothing that required a doctor's visit. And I don’t recall having a full-blown sinus infection in… oh, goodness, decades! Maybe when I was a young man. I’m generally quite healthy, all things considered. I eat a pretty good diet, try to stay active… mostly walking, these days. And I don't smoke, never have. Is that tenderness a bad sign, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a bad sign, Mr. Paske, but it's something we need to investigate further. It could be contributing to your sleepiness, or it could be something else entirely. I'm going to order a sleep study, a more comprehensive one than you've likely had before. We need to see if your CPAP machine is still effective and rule out other sleep disorders. And I’ll also order a complete blood count to check for any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A more thorough sleep study seems like a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. And the blood work too, of course. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… frustrating, you know? To still feel so tired after all this time. But I appreciate you taking this seriously. Thank you. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the sleep study?
DOCTOR: Yes. The sleep study will be at the sleep center downtown. You'll need to bring comfortable pajamas and any medications you currently take. Avoid caffeine and alcohol the day of the study. They’ll attach sensors to your head, chest, and legs to monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and muscle activity. It won't be comfortable, but it's necessary to get an accurate diagnosis. And honestly, Mr. Paske, based on your history, I'm starting to suspect it may be more than just sleep apnea. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'll also order a referral to an ENT specialist. The sinus tenderness warrants further investigation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An ENT specialist… alright. That sounds… thorough, which I suppose is a good thing. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… the sensors sound a bit daunting, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes. And I understand needing to rule out other possibilities. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I suppose that’s to be expected. When can I schedule the sleep study, Doctor? And the appointment with the ENT?
DOCTOR: My assistant, Maria, will contact you with scheduling information for both the sleep study and the ENT appointment. She's very efficient. You should hear from her within 24 hours. In the meantime, continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. And try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. I want to emphasize, Mr. Paske, that I want to get to the bottom of this for you. But it will require patience and cooperation. It's unlikely to be a quick fix. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing else that I can think of. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine then. And I had a bout of shingles a while ago, but that's long gone. Otherwise, I’m remarkably healthy for my age, all things considered. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. And I appreciate your patience, Doctor. Truly. It's good to know you’re taking this seriously. I'll look forward to hearing from Maria. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Any paperwork or anything?
DOCTOR: No, there's no additional paperwork at this time. Maria will provide you with all the necessary forms for the sleep study. Just remember, Mr. Paske, I’m here to help, but you need to be proactive about your health. Follow my instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. It's easy to get complacent at your age, but that won’t solve anything. Alright. I think that's everything for today. Have a good day, Mr. Paske. .
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, of course. I will. Proactive. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. And I will certainly hear from Maria. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Batara.
