DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test, with spit, to find out? I want to know my roots, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a very interesting question, Mr. Scobie. And it’s good you’re thinking about your family history. You're referring to genetic ancestry testing, often done with a saliva sample. While it can give you some information about your ancestral origins, it's important to understand what it can and can’t do. It won't tell you everything about your "people," but it can give you some clues. Before we get too far ahead, are you experiencing any current health concerns that brought you in today?
PATIENT: No, no health problems. Just… curious. I’m old, Doctor. Eighty-five years. I want to know before… before it’s too late. I just want to know where my family really came from. Is that okay? Will the test tell me about Marshall Islands people?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfectly okay. It’s wonderful that you’re interested in learning about your heritage. And yes, ancestry tests can provide information about people from the Marshall Islands. The accuracy depends on the company doing the testing and the databases they use. Some are better than others at representing populations from specific regions. Let me pull up some information on ancestry testing companies that have good representation of Pacific Islander genetics. Just one moment. While I do that, could you tell me a little bit about what you already know about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… not much, really. My parents, they didn’t talk about it much. They came from different islands, I think. My mama, she was from Majuro, I think that’s how you say it. And my papa… I think he was from Arno. But before that? They just said, “Long ago.” They were fishermen, simple people. I grew up fishing, making things with wood. That’s all I know, really. I’m not good at remembering dates, either. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. Family stories often get lost over time, and dates can be hard to recall. That's perfectly normal. Knowing your parents were from Majuro and Arno is a great starting point. Those are both atolls within the Marshall Islands, which gives us something concrete to work with. Okay, so a few companies seem to have fairly good representation of Marshallese genetics. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are both popular options. They both require you to submit a saliva sample, and the results typically take a few weeks to come back. They also offer information on potential health risks, though given your current good health, that might be less of a priority. Before we decide on a test, do you have any allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of, just in case there's any contraindication, however unlikely?
PATIENT: No allergies. No… conditions. I had a little trouble with my knee a few years back, but it’s okay now. Just gets a little stiff in the cold. Nothing serious. I mostly just fish and make little boats. Wood boats. I sell them at the market sometimes. The test… it doesn’t hurt? It’s just spit, right?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, the test doesn’t hurt at all. It’s just a saliva sample – you simply spit into a tube. It’s a very simple process. The company will send you instructions on how to collect the sample properly. Here, let me show you a brochure with some more information about the 23andMe ancestry test. It outlines the process, the types of information you can expect, and the cost. It's around $99, and they often have sales. They also have a privacy policy you might want to review. Would you like me to go over it with you, or would you prefer to take it home and look it over at your own pace?
PATIENT: Hmm. Ninety-nine dollars… that's not too bad. I think I can manage that. Could you just… tell me the important parts? I don’t see so good anymore, you know? What will it really tell me? Will it tell me what island my great-grandparents came from? That's what I really want to know. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. It's good you're asking these specific questions. The test analyzes your DNA and compares it to DNA from people all over the world. It will give you an estimate of your ethnic origins – so it can tell you the percentage of your DNA that comes from different regions, including the Marshall Islands, Southeast Asia, and other areas. It will likely tell you what broad regions your ancestors came from. However, it’s important to understand that it won’t pinpoint specific islands like Majuro or Arno for your great-grandparents. The further back you go in your family history, the less accurate the information becomes. It's good at identifying larger ancestral groups, but tracing it back to individual islands is very difficult, often impossible, with current technology. The report will give you a breakdown of your ancestry, potentially connecting you with distant relatives who have also taken the test. It can also give you information about migration patterns of your ancestors. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. So it won't tell me exactly where they lived, but it will tell me… somewhere around there? Like, maybe it will say "Pacific Islander" instead of "Majuro"? I guess that's okay. Better than nothing. I think… I think I want to try it. The $99 one. Is there… paperwork? Or do you just… order it? I don’t have a computer at home. My grandson, he does everything online for me. But I need to start it somehow.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Mr. Scobie. It will likely give you a broader regional breakdown, like "Pacific Islander" or potentially "Micronesian," rather than specific islands. It’s a good first step to learning more about your heritage. Luckily, we can order it for you here at the clinic. No need to worry about doing it online. I’ll need a little bit of information from you - your name, date of birth, and insurance information. Since you have Medicare, that should cover some of the cost. I’ll also need your grandson's contact information so the company can send you updates. Here’s a simple form. Just fill in the information, and I’ll take care of the rest. The test kit should arrive within a week or so, and it comes with detailed instructions on how to collect the sample. Do you have any questions about the form?
PATIENT: No questions about the form. Just my old eyes… but I can manage. Here… is my information. And my grandson, David, his number is here. He's a good boy. He helps me with everything. So… after I spit in the tube, I just send it back? How long does it take to get the results? I’m excited now. I haven't thought about my family this much in years. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Perfect, Mr. Scobie. Everything looks good. And yes, after you spit in the tube, you simply mail it back using the prepaid shipping label included in the kit. The results typically take between 6-8 weeks to come back, sometimes a little longer. Here’s a receipt for your purchase. And don’t worry, if you have any trouble collecting the sample or accessing the results online, you can always call us here at the clinic, and we’ll be happy to help. You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help. It’s wonderful that you’re taking the time to explore your family history. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. You've been very kind. I appreciate it. I’m going to go home now and tell David about it. He’ll be excited too.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy sharing the results with David.
