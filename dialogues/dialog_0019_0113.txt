DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Arlan. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, yes, good morning to you too, Doctor. Renzi, you said? Seems a fancy name. Well, it's this... this going to the bathroom thing. Too much, you see. Just… too much. It’s a bother, really. Wakes me up at night, mostly. And I have to… well, you know. It’s embarrassing, going so often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent urination, especially at night… that’s what we call nocturia. And it’s disrupting your sleep, you said?
PATIENT: Noct… what now? Look, I just know I’m going too often. Don’t need fancy words for it. Disrupting my sleep is putting it mildly. My wife, bless her heart, gets woken up too. She says I shuffle around too much. It’s… it’s just a nuisance, is what it is. Been happening a while, I reckon. Months, at least. Maybe longer. Hard to say, really. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, you’re right to keep it simple. Frequent bathroom trips, disrupting sleep… and it’s been going on for months. I understand. And it’s good you mentioned your wife notices – that’s helpful. Now, when you do go, is it a full emptying, or do you feel like you’re still needing to go afterwards?
PATIENT: Full emptying? Well… usually. Most times. Sometimes it feels like there’s a little left, you know? Not much, just a dribble maybe. Nothing to write home about. But it’s enough to make me go again a little while later. It’s like… it never really feels done. And honestly, Doctor, the stream itself ain’t what it used to be. Weak. Like a garden hose with a kink in it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes incomplete emptying, and a weaker stream. That's good information. Now, do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not usually. Sometimes… a little discomfort, maybe. Like a slight ache, low down. But nothing terrible. Doesn't make me cry or anything. It’s just… annoying. Like something’s not quite right. Been like that for a long time, I suppose. I just figured it came with getting old. Everything aches when you get old, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point. It can be hard to know what’s normal and what’s not as we get older. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Okay, I see you've had a couple of visits a few years back for blood pressure, but nothing that really jumps out related to this. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Heavens, I don’t pay attention to the color of my… well, you know. It’s… yellow, usually. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on how much water I drink, I suppose. Nothing… bloody or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve never noticed anything unusual, really. Honestly, Doctor, I’m more concerned about the frequency than the color. It’s just… inconvenient. And disruptive.
DOCTOR: Right, the frequency is the main concern. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little about your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day… hmm. Well, I wake up, usually around six. My wife, Martha, gets up earlier and makes coffee. I have a bowl of oatmeal. Then I check on the chickens, feed them, make sure everything's alright. I used to work the farm proper, you know, fields and all, but now I just do the smaller things. The chickens, the garden. Martha does most of the heavy lifting now. I read the paper, mostly. And… well, I drink a fair bit of coffee. Always have. Afternoon, I might tinker in the shed. Fix something, or try to fix something. Evenings, we watch the news. And then… well, then I go to the bathroom. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fair bit of coffee, and you're up and down quite a bit during the day. Now, do you have any difficulty starting to urinate?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting…? Now you’re asking about things I don’t pay attention to! Let me see… sometimes it takes a moment. Not a struggle, exactly, just… a little hesitation. Like a garden hose that’s been kinked for a while. It starts slow, then picks up. Nothing painful, just… takes a little effort. Or a little time. It's hard to say which.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight hesitation to start. Alright, Arlan, I think it would be good to do a quick physical exam, and then maybe get a urine sample to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? Oh. Well, I suppose so. I haven’t had one of those in a while. A urine sample… that’s easy enough. Just a little cup, I reckon? I don’t mind that. Just… try not to poke around too much, eh? I’m an old man, my bits are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arlan. We’ll be as gentle as possible. Just a quick look and listen, and then the urine sample. Let’s start with your blood pressure, and then we’ll move on to listening to your abdomen. Would you mind if I listened to your lungs while I'm at it?
PATIENT: Lungs too? Heavens. Alright, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just try to be quick about it, eh? My back's been acting up lately, and I don’t want to be lying around too long. Blood pressure first, you say? Go ahead then. Just… be careful with that cuff, alright? They always seem to tighten it so much.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, just relax your arm for me… and take a few deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 82. Not terribly high, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your lungs… just take some slow, deep breaths in and out. Okay, everything sounds relatively clear, but I do hear a little bit of congestion in your lower lungs. We’ll want to keep an eye on that as well. Now, let's just gently press on your abdomen, alright?
PATIENT: Congestion…? Oh dear. I haven't been feeling quite right lately, a bit of a tightness in my chest. I just figured it was getting old. Tightness… and a bit of a cough now and then. Nothing too serious, I thought. Press on my abdomen, you say? Alright. Be gentle, now. It's a bit tender, you see. Mostly on the left side. Martha says I've been looking a bit pale lately too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some tenderness on the lower left side, as you mentioned. Not severe, but present. And I noted your wife mentioned you’ve been looking pale, and you’ve described some chest tightness… Arlan, it’s good you’re telling me all of this. Now, while I don’t want to jump to conclusions, given your symptoms – the frequent urination, the chest tightness, the congestion, and the tenderness – I think it’s wise to order a few tests. We’ll need a urine sample, as we discussed, and I’d like to do a blood test to check your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. I also think it would be prudent to get a chest X-ray to investigate the congestion in your lungs. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Tests… a lot of tests. Heavens. Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I don't like going to hospitals, and I don't like needles, but… if it'll tell us what's wrong, I suppose I can handle a few tests. Chest X-ray… that sounds a bit scary, honestly. But alright, do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick about it, eh? And don’t poke around too much. And tell me when I can go home. Martha's expecting me for dinner.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arlan. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The urine sample will just be a quick collection, and the blood test is just a small prick. The chest X-ray is quick and painless – it doesn’t involve any needles. The nurse will be in shortly to take the sample and get you set up for the blood test. I’ll order the X-ray now. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. I don’t anticipate anything major, but it’s best to rule things out. In the meantime, I want to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated. Continue drinking plenty of fluids, and try to limit your coffee intake. If you experience any worsening chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Limit my coffee…? Heavens. That's going to be difficult. But alright, I suppose. I'll try. But no promises. Any other questions… hmm. Well, how long will these tests take? And will they hurt? And… will I need to come back again soon? Martha's not very good at driving me around, you see. And… will it affect my dinner? I'm quite looking forward to roast chicken.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Arlan. The urine sample and blood test should only take about 15-20 minutes each. The blood test will just be a quick pinch – most people don’t find it very painful. As for the X-ray, it’ll probably take about another 10-15 minutes. Regarding coming back, it depends on the results. I'd like to review them with you in person, so I'll give you a call as soon as they're available, probably within a few days. And as for your dinner… I don't anticipate anything interfering with your roast chicken. These tests shouldn't make you feel unwell. We'll get these done quickly so you can enjoy your meal. Now, let me just write down a few instructions for you, and the nurse will be in shortly to get started. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Let me see… I used to be allergic to bee stings, as a boy. But that was a long time ago. I haven't been stung in decades. And… I think I get a bit of a rash if I eat shellfish. But I haven't eaten shellfish in years. Apart from that… no, nothing comes to mind. Oh! Wait. My wife says I’m allergic to being woken up early. But that’s not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a medical allergy, Arlan. Bee stings and shellfish are good to know, though. We’ll make a note of those. Okay, great. So, to recap: we’re doing a urine sample and blood test today, and ordering a chest X-ray. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. Remember, if you experience any worsening chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, eh? And tell the nurse to be quick. Martha's a good cook, and I don't want my roast chicken to get cold. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening to an old man’s troubles. It’s good to know someone cares. Now, let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Of course, Arlan. We’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll let the nurse know to be quick, and I promise we’ll get you back to your roast chicken as soon as we can. It was my pleasure listening to you. That's what I'm here for. I’ll step out now and let the nurse in. She'll explain everything to you. Just relax, and we’ll take good care of you. .
PATIENT: .
