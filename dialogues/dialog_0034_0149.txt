DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor… Seil, you said? Well, I don’t rightly remember why I’m here, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, she scheduled this. Something about… not wanting things done. I keep telling her, I know my own body. I’ve been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. Longer than you’ve been alive, I’m sure. What were we talking about?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Wynell. It's common to have a lot on your mind. Your daughter is very thoughtful to ensure you have regular check-ups. Let's see… according to the schedule, this is a general wellness visit, but we can certainly address anything specific you're concerned about, even if you don’t recall the initial reason for the appointment. Perhaps we can start by going through a quick review of your current health. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, honey, at my age? Where isn’t there a little ache? But nothing a good soak in Epsom salts can’t fix. No, no real pain. My feet are alright, considering. I still see patients sometimes, you know. Just friends, mostly. Can’t let the skills go to waste. Though, I do wish they'd make better shoes these days. Everything’s so… flimsy. Are you a shoe person, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your dedication to your practice, Wynell. It's wonderful that you're still able to help others. And you’re right – finding comfortable, supportive shoes can be a challenge! I’m more focused on function than fashion, myself. Let's get back to your health. When you say "a little ache," can you tell me where you typically feel those aches?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere! My knees, mostly. And my back. It’s just… old age, dear. Happens to the best of us. I used to be able to stand all day, you know. Now, I have to sit down after a bit. My daughter keeps telling me about exercises. “Strengthen your core,” she says. As if I don't know about strengthening the core! I’ve got a medical degree, you know. Though... what year I got it... that's slipping my mind. Is this important? Are you going to ask me a lot of dates? Because I really don't do well with dates.
DOCTOR: No, Wynell, dates aren't important right now. Your overall well-being is what matters most. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a little hazy with memory as we get older. You mentioned aches in your knees and back. Are these aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go. Mostly when the weather changes. Damp weather is the worst. My arthritis flares up. Though, to be honest, I’m not even sure it is arthritis. Doctor Miller, back in… oh, dear, what was his name? Anyway, he said something about it, but I don’t remember all the details. It’s been years. I just take some over-the-counter stuff. Helps a little. Though, sometimes I worry about mixing things. My daughter says I should only take what she gives me. She means well, but she’s so… controlling.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel a bit confused about medications, and it’s good your daughter is trying to help. To make sure everything is safe, could you tell me what medications you're currently taking, even the over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take… something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And the arthritis stuff. Ibuprofen, I think? Sometimes naproxen. And…oh, and a vitamin D. My daughter is always on about vitamin D. She says I don’t get enough sun. Honestly, I don’t remember what dose of any of it I take. She handles all that. She has a little chart in the kitchen, but… I haven't looked at it in ages. I just take what she gives me, when she tells me to. It’s easier that way, you know? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Wynell. It sounds like your daughter is very involved in your care, which is good. However, it’s important for me to have a clear understanding of everything you’re taking, including dosages. Would you be comfortable with me speaking with your daughter directly, perhaps to clarify the medication list and dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t know about that. She’d be… well, she’d be a lot. She likes to talk. And she’ll tell you everything. Everything I eat, everything I do. It's… a little much, sometimes. I don’t want to cause trouble. Maybe… maybe you could just write down a list of things I should be taking? And I'll show it to her. That way, she can tell me exactly what she's giving me. That might be easier. I just… I don’t want to get her upset. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable approach, Wynell. We can certainly do that. I’ll write down a list of common medications for blood pressure, arthritis, and vitamin D supplementation, and you can review it with your daughter. Before we move on, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, weight? Well, I’m not as spry as I used to be, if that’s what you mean. I think I’ve lost a little bit. Hard to say. I don’t really weigh myself anymore. Used to, but… what’s the point? It’s just a number, isn’t it? And honestly, I eat what I want. A little bit of everything. Can’t deprive myself at my age. I like my little treats. My daughter tries to give me those… healthy things. But they don’t taste very good. So, I sneak in a little chocolate now and then. Don’t tell her I said that! She’d have a fit.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. A little enjoyment is important. It's good to hear you're still able to enjoy your favorite foods. Since you mentioned changes in your weight and appetite, have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing or any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking all sorts of things! Swallowing… no, not really. Everything goes down alright. Though sometimes… sometimes I feel a little heartburn. It happens now and then. Especially if I eat something spicy. Or chocolate, come to think of it. And… well, let’s just say things aren’t as regular as they used to be. What’s the point of dwelling on it, though? It’s just part of getting old. My daughter keeps offering me… prune juice. I told her no! That stuff tastes awful! Honestly, I don't like talking about this. It's… private.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. These are personal questions, and you’re right to feel a little uncomfortable discussing them. We don’t have to dwell on anything you don’t want to talk about. Let's shift gears a little. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago. And I think… I think I had a little reaction to penicillin once, when I was younger. But that was a long time ago, too. I don’t remember exactly what happened. Just… a rash, I think. Nothing serious. My mother always said I had sensitive skin. But that was a long time ago, dear. A very long time ago. Honestly, my memory is just… terrible these days. Is this important? You’re asking a lot of questions. I’m starting to feel a little tired.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Wynell. It’s completely normal to feel tired, and you’re doing wonderfully answering my questions. It's helpful to know about the possible penicillin reaction and the sensitive skin. We'll make a note of that. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Surgeries… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. Fell off a bicycle. Silly, I know. And… I think I was in the hospital once, for pneumonia. But that was ages ago. Before your mother was born, probably. Honestly, my memory is just a blur. It’s like looking through fog. I’m not sure I can remember much else. Is it okay if we stop now? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. Maybe my daughter can answer some of these questions?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. We can definitely stop here. It’s perfectly alright, and it sounds like your daughter would be a wonderful resource. We can discuss bringing her in to help fill in any gaps in the history. Before we finish, would you mind if I did a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. Just be gentle. My arms are a little sensitive these days. And don’t take too long, please. I'm starting to feel a little… drained. Honestly, all these questions… it's just too much. But go ahead. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. Just relax your arm for me. This cuff will inflate briefly. Your blood pressure is 140/85. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. And your pulse feels strong and regular. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, would you be comfortable if I listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. But don’t put that cold thing on my back! I hate that. And don't listen too long. It makes me nervous. I always feel like they're going to find something wrong. I'm old, you know. Things are bound to be… worn out. But go ahead. Just be quick about it. And tell me if you find anything. I want to know. Don’t keep secrets from me. I’m a podiatrist, you know. I know a thing or two about bodies.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I'll be as quick as possible, and I'll explain everything I’m doing. I’ll use a warm stethoscope, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs from both the front and the back. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Everything sounds normal, Wynell. Your heart and lungs are functioning well. Now, would you mind if I just take a quick look in your ears and throat?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But be gentle with the ear thing. I have sensitive ears. And don’t shine that bright light in my eyes! It makes me squint. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… it’s just too much. I’m getting old, you know. I’m fragile. But go ahead. Just be quick about it. And tell me if you see anything. I want to know. Don't keep secrets from me. I'm a podiatrist. I know what's going on with bodies. Just be careful. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears. This will only take a moment. Your ears are clear, with no signs of infection or blockage. And your throat looks healthy, with no redness or swelling. Everything looks good, Wynell. Your ears and throat are healthy. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but otherwise, your vital signs are stable. Your heart, lungs, ears, and throat all appear healthy. Now, do you have any specific concerns you’d like to discuss, or would you like me to review your medications with your daughter at a later time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated blood pressure? What does that mean? Is that bad? My mother had high blood pressure. Is that what this is? Oh dear. And I told you, I don't remember what medications I’m taking! It’s all a blur. I think… I think I’d like to talk to my daughter about the medications. She knows everything. And maybe she can tell you about… about what’s been bothering me. My feet are a little sore, you know. They ache sometimes. But I don't know if it's anything serious. Honestly, I’m just tired. All this… all this talking… it’s just too much. I think I just want to go home now. Can I go home now?
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. We can absolutely wrap things up. It sounds like talking with your daughter would be the best next step. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should, and it's something we want to keep an eye on. I'll write a note summarizing my findings, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your medications and address your foot pain after you've had a chance to speak with your daughter. In the meantime, I’ll give you a handout about high blood pressure. Just some general information. Would you like me to call a nurse to help you get ready to leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. Yes, please. I don't think I can manage on my own. My legs are a little shaky. And thank you, Doctor. You were very kind. Even if you poked and prodded a little too much. But thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I just need a moment to catch my breath. I'm so tired. I think I’ll just sit here for a minute. Maybe my daughter will call soon. She worries so much. But that's alright. She means well. Just… get me a nurse, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. The nurse will be here shortly to assist you. I’ll leave you in their capable hands. And please don't hesitate to let them know if you need anything at all. It was a pleasure meeting you, Wynell. And remember, we’re here to help in any way we can.
