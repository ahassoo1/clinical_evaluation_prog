DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Kandy – these things happen, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. So, you're saying it's difficult to initiate urination, and then it takes a while to get a full stream going?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Initiate is a good word for it. It doesn’t feel like… like it used to. And then, even when it does start, it’s not as strong as it once was. It just… trickles for a bit before it gets going properly. It's been going on for… oh, maybe a month or so now. I didn't think much of it at first, but it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so. And it’s gradually gotten worse, not come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It didn't just happen one day. It was very slow, little by little. One day I noticed it took a bit longer, then the next day a little longer still. Now it's… well, like I said. It's not painful, though. Just… frustrating. And a bit worrying, to be honest. I don't like feeling like I can't… control things properly, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand that feeling, Kandy. It is worrying when your body isn’t cooperating the way it used to. And it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Just to get a better picture of things, are you having any trouble completely emptying your bladder when you go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think so, yes. It feels like… like there’s always a little bit left in there, even after I’ve gone. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I sometimes have to go back again a little while later, which I didn't used to do. I suppose I just thought I was getting old! But now… now I’m thinking maybe it’s more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some sensation of incomplete emptying, and needing to return shortly after to urinate. And no pain at all with urination?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not a bit. It’s not a burning feeling or anything like that, just… weak. And the feeling of not getting everything out. I also find myself… going more often during the day than I used to, even if it’s just a little bit. It's not a huge amount more, maybe one or two extra times, but it's noticeable. It’s disrupting my… my gardening, mostly. I have to keep going back inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency during the day, along with the difficulty initiating, weak stream, and incomplete emptying. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago, but it's well controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And… oh, I had a gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was a long time ago and I haven't had any trouble with that since. Other than that… no, not really. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat a lot of beetroot, you know. And I walk every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for the blood pressure. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis in my hands, but that’s just when it’s really bothering me. It’s an over-the-counter cream, mostly. Nothing I take regularly. And no allergies to any medications, as far as I know. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other regular medications or allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had… well, she had some problems with her kidneys when she got older, I think. She was always a bit vague about it. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He didn't live to be very old. But nothing specific that I know of that would be relevant to this, I don't think. They weren't big on talking about medical things, you know? Mostly just said "old age" and left it at that. I have a brother, but I haven't seen him in years. I don't know what he's been up to.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of kidney problems in your mother and heart issues in your father. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Tried it once when I was young, didn't like it. And I don't drink alcohol either. Not at all. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, to be honest. Much better for you! I do drink a lot of water, though, especially now that I’m trying to… you know, go to the bathroom more often. Does that make sense? I’m trying to flush things through, if you see what I mean.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Kandy. Staying hydrated is a good idea. Okay, so no smoking, no alcohol, and you drink a lot of water. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: Well, I usually wake up around seven, have a cup of tea and a piece of toast. Then I spend most of the day in my garden. I grow tomatoes, beetroot, cucumbers… all sorts of things. It keeps me busy! I walk to the shops in the afternoon to get what I need. And in the evening, I watch a bit of television, read a book, and go to bed around ten. It's a simple life, but I enjoy it. It's just… this bathroom problem is making it a bit difficult, you know? I have to keep stopping and starting, and it interrupts everything. It's frustrating!
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like this is definitely impacting your quality of life, and we want to figure out what’s going on. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick neurological check. Then I'm going to do a prostate exam, if that's okay with you. It's a standard part of assessing urinary issues in men, and it can give us some important information.
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate exam? I… I didn't realize men had prostates. I’m a woman, Doctor. Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding? I thought you were just checking… well, everything generally. I’m a bit confused now. I don’t understand why you’d need to check a prostate on a woman.
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness! You are absolutely right. I sincerely apologize, Kandy. That was a terrible mistake on my part. I am so sorry. I’ve clearly mixed up your chart with another patient’s. Please forgive me. We will proceed with a standard abdominal and neurological exam. I apologize again for the error. It was completely unprofessional of me. Let's start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, it's alright, Doctor. Mistakes happen. Don't worry about it. I was just a bit surprised, that’s all. It’s good you caught it. Yes, let's listen to my abdomen. Is that… will it be uncomfortable? I’m not very good with doctors, you see. A bit of a nervous patient, I suppose. And I do get cold easily.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be uncomfortable at all, Kandy. It’s just like listening to your heart – I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. And I’ll make sure you’re covered up and comfortable the whole time. Just breathe normally for me, please. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes in your legs. Just relax, and I'll tap a few spots with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt.
PATIENT: Alright, that doesn’t sound too bad. Reflexes… yes, I can manage that. It’s just needles I don’t like. And blood. Oh, and those machines that make buzzing noises. But reflexes are fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to stay relaxed. I'm doing my best! It’s just… I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, you see. My mother used to say I worried too much. And she was probably right.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are good and symmetrical, which is excellent. Everything seems to be functioning normally there as well. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your bladder habits. On a typical day, how many times do you feel the urge to urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s difficult to say exactly. Usually, about four or five times, I suppose. But lately, it’s been more like six or seven. It's not a huge difference, but I notice it. And I have to get up at least once during the night, which I didn't used to do. Just a little bit, mind you. Not a full bladder, just enough to need to go. And it's interrupting my sleep, which is annoying. I used to sleep like a log! Now I’m waking up a couple of times during the night. It’s just… frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase in frequency to six or seven times a day and nocturia – waking up at least once at night to urinate. And you mentioned it’s not a full bladder when you get up at night, just enough to feel the urge. Now, when you do urinate, do you feel like you’re able to empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. Like I said before, it feels like there's always a little bit left in there. Even after I've gone, I sometimes have to go back again a little while later. It's not every time, but often enough to notice. And it's… well, it's a bit embarrassing to admit, but sometimes it takes me a few tries to get everything out. I have to… strain a little, you see? It's not painful, but it's not easy either. It's just… weak, like I said. And it’s getting worse, I think. I’m worried it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing increased frequency, nocturia, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and some hesitancy and straining when you urinate. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have an overactive bladder and possibly some mild urinary retention. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. I'd also like to perform a postvoid residual volume test, which measures the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. This will help us determine if you are retaining a significant amount of urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis and… postvoid residual volume test. That sounds a bit complicated, but if it helps, then yes, let's do it. I just want to get to the bottom of this and get back to my gardening. It’s very important to me, you see. It keeps me sane! Will the tests be… unpleasant? And how long will they take? I have a beetroot harvest next week that I don’t want to miss.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis is very straightforward – just a simple urine sample. We have a private bathroom here where you can collect it. As for the postvoid residual volume test, it’s also quite simple. After you urinate, a small, handheld device will be used to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn’t cause any discomfort at all. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes total for both tests. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the process in more detail, and we’ll get everything scheduled. We should have the results back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, but try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate the bladder. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Fifteen to twenty minutes… that’s not too bad at all. And no caffeine or alcohol… I can manage that easily. I don’t drink much of either, anyway. Just chamomile tea for me! And the nurse will explain everything in more detail… that’s very reassuring. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better. So, just chamomile tea, no caffeine, and let the nurse know when you’re ready? That’s all I need to remember, right? I’m terrible with remembering things!
DOCTOR: Exactly, Kandy. Chamomile tea, avoid caffeine, and let the nurse come in and explain the tests. You’ve got it. And don’t worry about remembering – that’s what we’re here for. I’ll also make a note of everything in your chart, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything. I’m glad I could reassure you. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully get you back to enjoying your gardening soon. I'll step out now and let the nurse come in. Is there anything else I can do for you before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and your kindness. I really appreciate it. I feel much better knowing that you’re taking this seriously. And thank you for reminding me about the chamomile tea! It's my favourite. You have a good day now, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. It was my pleasure. And you have a good day too. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. .
