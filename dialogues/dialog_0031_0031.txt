DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s been quite swollen. And the nurse mentioned something about… my heart beating funny? I’ve known about that for a bit, but it's mostly just felt like… fluttering, you see. But the leg is new.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the left leg and some palpitations you've noticed for a while. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what's going on, let's start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, about three days ago, I believe. It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness around my ankle. But it’s gotten worse each day. It's rather uncomfortable now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days ago, starting with puffiness around the ankle and now causing discomfort. And has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or certain activities?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don't think so, not that I've noticed. I do a fair bit of walking, getting to and from the college, but I haven’t been doing more than usual. And I try to sit when I can. It seems to just… get worse as the day goes on. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It's helpful that you haven't noticed anything specifically making it worse, and that it worsens throughout the day. That pattern can be indicative of a few different things. Now, regarding your heart palpitations - you mentioned you’ve been aware of those for a bit. Can you describe what that "fluttering" feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to explain. It feels like my chest is sort of… vibrating, I suppose. Not painful, exactly. More like… a quick, unsteady beat. Sometimes it's just a few flutters, and other times it feels like my heart is racing. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it's frequent enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a vibrating sensation and sometimes a racing heart. Does it happen when you're resting, or does activity bring it on?
PATIENT: It seems to happen most when I'm resting, actually. Or trying to. If I'm busy, walking or working, I don't notice it nearly as much. It's usually when I sit down to relax that I feel it. Does that make sense? I hope I'm explaining it properly.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Nixon. It’s very helpful information. Okay, let's move on to some other questions to get a clearer picture. Do you have any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or dizziness associated with the palpitations?
PATIENT: No, not really. No chest pain, thankfully. And I haven’t been short of breath. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I put that down to… well, being a teacher, mostly. I haven’t felt dizzy either, no. Just the funny heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness—just the palpitations. And you attribute some fatigue to your work. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, as the nurse mentioned, I do know about this irregular heartbeat thing. A doctor told me a while back it was… atrial fibrillation, I think? But he didn't really do much about it. Just said to… keep an eye on it. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing a good rest couldn't fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, but it wasn’t actively managed. And no other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. No surgeries, and thankfully, never needed to be in the hospital. I've always been quite healthy, up until… well, this leg and the heart thing, of course. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you haven’t had any surgeries or hospitalizations. It’s understandable that you’re concerned, Nixon. It's too early to say definitively if it's serious, but we need to investigate thoroughly. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of heart problems, blood clots, or swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… some trouble with her legs when she was older. Swelling, mostly. She didn't really talk about it much, but I remember her complaining about it. She lived back in Scotland, so it was difficult to get much information. My father… he was quite healthy, as far as I know. No heart problems that I’m aware of. It’s difficult to say, really. We weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of leg swelling in your mother, and no known heart problems in your father. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh. Well, I work a lot, at the college, teaching computer science. I spend most of my day at a desk, to be honest. I try to walk when I can, like I said, but it's not very strenuous. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. I eat fairly healthy, I think – lots of vegetables. It's not very exciting, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Nixon. It sounds like you maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle overall. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. No known allergies at all. I can take most medications without any problems, as far as I know. And I’m not allergic to anything I eat, or anything like that. I'm a fairly simple person, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don’t really take anything. I try to avoid medications if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, mostly. I don’t even take vitamins, if you can believe it! I know it's probably silly, but I just prefer to… not bother with them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Thank you, Nixon, for providing that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your leg more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Do you need me to do anything?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please just relax and breathe normally. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with the previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let’s examine your leg. There is significant edema in your lower left leg, extending up to the calf. It's warm to the touch, but no significant tenderness. I’ll also check your pulses. Pulses are present but slightly diminished in your left leg compared to your right. Capillary refill is a little slow, around 3 seconds.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Is it… is it a blood clot? I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re concerned, Nixon, and it's good you're asking questions. The diminished pulse and slow capillary refill are concerning findings, and a blood clot is a possibility we need to investigate. However, it’s not the only possibility. Other things can cause similar symptoms, like venous insufficiency or lymphatic obstruction. To determine the cause, I’d like to order a few tests. An ultrasound of your leg will help us visualize the veins and look for any clots. A D-dimer blood test can also help rule out a blood clot, though it's not always definitive. And a complete blood count will give us some additional information. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think those tests are necessary, then please, go ahead. What exactly does an ultrasound involve? And will the blood test be painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's get those ordered. An ultrasound is non-invasive. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and then use a handheld device to scan the veins. It doesn’t hurt at all, but it might feel a little cold. The blood test involves a simple blood draw from your arm – you’ll feel a brief pinch, as with any blood draw. I’m also going to ask the nurse to check your oxygen saturation. While we wait for the results, it's important to elevate your leg as much as possible. That can help reduce the swelling. And avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… manageable. Elevate my leg. I can do that. Will I… will I need to go to the hospital if it is a blood clot? That's what I'm most worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Nixon. If the ultrasound confirms a blood clot, you would likely need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment with anticoagulants, or blood thinners. The length of stay would depend on the size and location of the clot, and your overall health. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We don’t know if you have a clot yet, and the tests will give us a clearer picture. It’s important to stay calm and let the results guide our next steps. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the ultrasound. In the meantime, do you have any pain in your leg currently?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's just… heavy. And a bit achy, maybe. But not sharp, or anything. Just uncomfortable. Will the tests take long? I have a lecture to prepare for this afternoon… It’s about binary code.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and “achy” is helpful. It sounds more like discomfort than a sharp pain, which is good. As for the tests, the blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the ultrasound usually takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s possible it could take a little longer depending on the technician’s schedule and how easy it is to visualize the veins. I will do my best to make sure it doesn’t interfere too much with your lecture preparations. Let's see… the nurse is here now. She’ll be in to draw your blood, and then we can discuss the next steps. I'll also let the radiology department know you're coming in, and they can schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It's my pleasure to help. Just focus on elevating your leg and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here's the nurse, Sarah. She’ll get started with the blood draw. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available.
PATIENT: Thank you. .
