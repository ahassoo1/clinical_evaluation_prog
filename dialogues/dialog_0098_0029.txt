DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, really. I just get full awful quick these days. Even after just a little bit of food. Doesn’t matter what it is, it seems. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food. And it doesn’t seem to be related to what you’re eating, just the amount?
PATIENT: That's right. My wife, Elsie, keeps saying I’m not eating enough, but it’s not that I don’t want to eat, you see. It’s just… after a few bites, I feel like I’ve had a big meal. Like my stomach is telling me to stop, even when it hasn’t. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound unsettling. And it's good you're paying attention to that feeling. Now, has anything else changed alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Elsie has noticed I’m a bit more tired than usual, maybe. Not sick tired, just… worn out quicker. And I've lost a little bit of weight, I suppose. Not a lot, but my trousers feel a bit looser. I hadn’t really connected it to the quick fullness, though. Is that… is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing those things, and yes, those could be related. Weight loss and fatigue alongside early fullness… we should explore that further. Before we get into a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your usual diet?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie does most of the cooking, bless her heart. We eat pretty regular, I’d say. Lots of fish, we’re Haida, after all. And soups, stews, vegetables… not much fast food or anything like that. We try to eat healthy. Breakfast is usually oatmeal or toast. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe some fruit. And dinner is whatever Elsie makes – usually fish with potatoes and a vegetable. Nothing fancy, really. I do enjoy a bit of bannock sometimes, if Elsie makes it.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very wholesome diet. And you said this has been happening for a few weeks now?
PATIENT: That's right, a few weeks. It didn’t start suddenly, you know? It was gradual. First, it was just feeling a little less hungry, then a little fullness after a normal portion. Now, it’s like I can barely get through a small plate. It’s starting to worry me, to be honest. Elsie keeps saying I should just eat more, but it’s not that simple. I want to, but my body just won’t let me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re listening to your body. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been a little bit… gassy, I suppose. More than usual. And sometimes, after eating, I feel a bit bloated, uncomfortable. Not painful, just… full of air. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s been happening more often lately. Oh, and Elsie says I’ve been a bit more quiet than usual, but that could just be me getting old!
DOCTOR: That's all helpful information, Mr. Obarr. Bloating and increased gas alongside the early fullness… we’re building a picture here. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my fifties. And I had a bit of a bad knee for a while, but that's been mostly sorted with physiotherapy. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, must be five or six years now. Just for check-ups, mostly. Elsie always keeps telling me to go more often!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, knee issues… and it’s been about five or six years since your last check-up. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never been much of a one for pills, if I can help it. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knee if it flares up, but that’s it. Elsie has a whole cupboard full of things, but I try to stay away from them if I can. She worries about me, you see. Wants me to take something for everything!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And no allergies to any medications or foods that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything Elsie puts in front of me, and she makes all sorts! Though, I don’t care much for those newfangled fizzy drinks, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy. Elsie likes them, though. She says they’re refreshing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. No allergies, no regular medications. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any issues with stomach problems, like cancer or ulcers?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... My mother, she had some trouble with her digestion when she got older, but the doctor just said it was part of getting old. Nothing serious, as far as I know. My father was healthy as a horse, never had a day's illness in his life. And my sister… well, she passed away a few years ago, but it was from a heart condition, not anything stomach-related. As for my children… they seem healthy enough, thankfully. No stomach problems that I know of. Elsie might know more, she keeps track of everyone’s health. She’s very organized, that woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It sounds like there isn’t a strong family history of stomach problems. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Elsie always says I need to see a doctor more often, so I suppose this is a good thing. I just hope it’s nothing serious. It's just… unsettling, not being able to eat properly. Makes me feel weak, you know? But go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. If you could lie down on the table, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay… I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, but they seem a little… quiet. Not alarming, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Alright… there’s a little bit of tenderness in your upper abdomen, but nothing too significant. No masses or organomegaly that I can detect. Your abdomen is a little… distended, but that could be due to gas.
PATIENT: Well… that doesn't sound too bad, does it? A little bit of tenderness and a bit of gas. Elsie always says I eat too much air when I talk! Is that… is that a possibility? I do like a good chat, you see. And I do get a bit breathless sometimes when I’m telling a story. Maybe that’s it? But… what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm starting to get a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know how you’re feeling, Mr. Obarr. It’s not necessarily serious, but it is something we need to investigate further. The tenderness and distension, combined with the early fullness, weight loss, and fatigue… it could be a number of things. It’s possible it’s related to something as simple as increased gas, as you suggested, but we can’t rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. I also think a stool test would be a good idea, to check for any infections or abnormalities. And, depending on the results of those tests, we might need to consider further imaging, like an ultrasound or a CT scan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… stool tests… ultrasound… CT scan… Goodness. That sounds like a lot. But… if it’s to find out what’s wrong, then I suppose it’s necessary. Elsie always says I worry too much, but it’s hard not to when you don’t know what’s going on. Yes, Doctor, go ahead. Order whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I want to be able to enjoy a good meal with my wife, without feeling full after just a few bites. And I want to be able to tell my stories without getting breathless. What do I need to do? Where do I go for these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. I understand your concerns, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests and the stool test. You can go to the lab at the Suburban Medical Centre, it’s just down the road. They’re open Monday to Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. You don’t need an appointment for the blood tests, but it’s best to call ahead for the stool test to make sure they have the collection containers. The blood test results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. The stool test might take a little longer, around 5-7 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule another appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try to stick to smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid foods that you know trigger gas or bloating. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Suburban Medical Centre… smaller meals… avoid gas… Yes, that makes sense. Elsie will be glad to hear that, she’s always telling me to eat smaller portions. She’ll probably make me a special diet! And if things get worse, go to the emergency room. Goodness. I hope it doesn’t come to that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, knowing that you’re looking into it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll go get these tests done as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. For now, just focus on those smaller meals and try to stay hydrated. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And, just to be on the safe side, I'm going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. It’s always good to have a specialist involved, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. They can provide a more detailed assessment and offer further treatment options if needed. Here's the referral. You can book an appointment with the gastroenterologist whenever you're ready. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… Goodness. That sounds serious! But… I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Elsie always says that. No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. I’ll go get the tests done and book an appointment with the gastroenterologist. Thank you again for everything. I suppose I’ll see you in a few days, once the test results are back?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Obarr, I’ll be in touch once the results are back. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
