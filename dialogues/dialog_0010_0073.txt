DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s…it’s my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. It's been going on for weeks, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, weeks, you said. And you’ve tried over-the-counter medications. Can you describe what’s happening a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. It’s…watery. A lot of it. Several times a day. And it’s not just right after I eat, it's happening even when I haven't. I feel weak, tired all the time, and honestly, it's embarrassing. You wouldn't understand unless it was you constantly searching for a restroom. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I do understand it’s distressing, Ms. Woodring. And I appreciate you being so open with me. Several times a day… and watery stools, even when not eating. Has there been any blood in the stool, or any fever or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Definitely no blood. And no fever, no chills. Just…exhaustion. And a lot of trips to the bathroom. I already told you that. Honestly, are you going to ask me a million questions, or are you actually going to do something about this? It’s just…really inconvenient, and I have things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be taking a long time, Ms. Woodring. I need to gather enough information to help you effectively. Okay, so no blood, no fever. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat the same things I always do. Salmon, rice, some vegetables. I’m Tlingit, we eat what we eat. I haven't started anything new or anything like that. Maybe…well, my daughter brought me some store-bought cookies last week, but that was days ago, and I only had a couple. I doubt that’s it. This has been going on longer than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, salmon, rice, vegetables, and a couple of cookies a few days ago. And this has been ongoing for weeks. Do you experience any pain or cramping with this, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. It comes and goes. It’s not like a proper stomachache, it’s just…uncomfortable. And it’s worse when I feel it coming on, you know? Like a warning. Honestly, this is all so obvious. Can we just get to the part where you figure out what’s wrong and give me something to fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I'm trying to be as efficient as possible. A dull ache coming and going, worse before you need to go… Have you noticed any bloating or gas with this?
PATIENT: Bloating? A little, maybe. But honestly, who doesn’t get bloated sometimes? It's not like I'm puffed up like a balloon or anything. Look, I’m a grown woman. I know my body. I’ve lived with it for 37 years. I just need something to stop this diarrhea. It’s interfering with my life. Can we please move this along? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I understand. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything obvious. It shouldn’t take long. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Bowel sounds are… active, as expected given your symptoms. I'm not hearing anything concerning. Do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I’ve taken plenty of pills in my life, and I haven’t dropped dead yet. Is that enough information? Can we finally talk about what's wrong with me and what I need to take to fix it? I'm starting to get a headache just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I’m going to access your EHR information now. I see here you have no significant past medical history, no recent surgeries, and your last check-up was a couple of years ago. You're currently not on any medications. Given your symptoms and what we've discussed, it's possible this could be a case of infectious gastroenteritis, possibly viral. However, given the duration of your symptoms—weeks—we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a stool sample to check for parasites and bacteria. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A…stool sample? Seriously? You need my poop? Look, I barely have time to go to the bathroom, let alone collect a sample. Is there anything else I can take? Like, a pill? Something easy? This is ridiculous. I guess…fine, I’ll get a sample. But I'm not happy about it. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. And hurry it up. I'm losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration. I'll have the nurse give you a collection kit and instructions. It's a relatively simple process. We'll also check your weight today, which is 52 kilograms. Given your reported symptoms of weakness, let's order some basic blood work to check your electrolytes and rule out dehydration. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Blood work, stool sample… just get it over with. Are you going to tell me why I’m going through all this, or just keep ordering tests? This is so inefficient. And honestly, a little patronizing.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m coming across that way, Ms. Woodring. It’s not my intention. The tests are necessary to properly determine the cause of your ongoing diarrhea and ensure we give you the correct treatment. Given the length of time you’ve been experiencing this, it’s important to rule out things like inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption issues. While viral gastroenteritis is possible, it usually resolves within a few days. Until we have the test results, I'm going to recommend you stay well hydrated, continue eating a bland diet, and avoid dairy, caffeine, and sugary drinks. We can also discuss a medication to help manage the symptoms, like loperamide, but I want to be cautious until we know the cause. Would you like to try loperamide?
PATIENT: Loperamide… is that one of those things that just stops it for a little while? Honestly, if it’s just going to keep coming back, what’s the point? Fine. Give me the loperamide. Just…how much do I take? And can we please be done with this now? I have a painting to finish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. Loperamide will help manage the symptoms, but it won’t address the underlying cause. It’s important we get the test results back to determine that. The usual dose is 4 milligrams initially, then 2 milligrams after each loose stool, not to exceed 16 milligrams in a 24-hour period. I'm going to write you a prescription for that. The nurse will give you instructions on the stool sample collection, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just…get me out of here. And make sure that nurse explains the stool sample very clearly. I don't want to have to come back in here just because I did it wrong. Honestly, this whole experience has been a waste of my time. .
