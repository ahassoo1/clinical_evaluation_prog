DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mother… she had a lot of health problems, and my grandmother before her. It just got me thinking, you know? I want to make sure I’m not headed down the same path. It’s probably just anxiety, but better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It’s good you’re thinking of this now. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about what specific problems your mother and grandmother experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh, where to even start? My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And her heart was always giving her trouble. Lots of trips to the hospital for that. Before that, my grandmother… she had something with her memory, you know? Like she just… faded away. Doctors kept saying it was “old age” but it was pretty quick, if you ask me. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the specifics. My parents didn’t really talk about it much, it was just… sad. And I wasn’t really paying attention back then, I was a kid. Does that make sense? I just know it wasn't good. A lot of pills, a lot of worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Theriot. It’s often difficult to recall precise details from the past, especially when it involves difficult memories. So, diabetes and heart issues with your mother, and memory problems with your grandmother. We will certainly keep those in mind as we proceed. Now, let’s focus on you. Are you experiencing any symptoms currently that are concerning you?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s why I said it’s probably nothing. I feel fine. Perfectly normal. I just… get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? And I guess I’m a little more… forgetful than I used to be, but honestly, I've been busy. Work is stressful. It’s probably just stress, you know? I don’t want to waste your time with something that’s just… me being a normal, busy person.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Theriot. It’s good you’re self-aware. However, even seemingly minor changes can be worth investigating, especially with your family history. Let’s just run through a brief review of systems, just to be thorough. It won't take long. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? I eat whatever's easiest. Usually takeout. And I probably haven't weighed myself in… years. I'm pretty thin, if that matters. Always have been. People tell me I should eat more, but I just don't have much of an appetite, really. I'm not a big eater. Does that count as a change? I haven’t gained any weight, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, maintaining your weight. That's good to know. And you mentioned not being a big eater. Now, have you been experiencing any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? It’s… okay. I don't sleep great, but who does, really? I toss and turn a bit, think a lot. Work stresses me out. But I get enough hours, I guess. I’m not falling asleep standing up or anything. It's not like I'm exhausted all the time. Just… restless sometimes. I drink a little tea before bed, helps calm me down. Chamomile, mostly.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is a good habit. Restless sleep, but generally getting enough hours. Now, let's move on to something else. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. That question? Look, Doctor, I’m an engineer, not a… a medical textbook. Do you really need to know about that? I mean, it’s… normal. Goes in, comes out. Sometimes a little… different, depending on what I ate. But nothing major, I assure you. Is this really necessary? I came here because of my family, not because I’m suddenly having digestive issues.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Mr. Theriot. I apologize if that was too personal. It’s just a standard part of a general health assessment, and changes can sometimes indicate underlying issues. We can certainly skip that question if you’re uncomfortable. However, I do want to gather as much information as possible to ensure we’re providing the best care. Now, let’s move on to something a bit different. Have you noticed any changes in your urination habits?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Are you trying to make me uncomfortable? I came here because I'm worried about potentially inheriting some terrible disease, and you're asking me about… bodily functions? I just don’t understand the point of all this. I feel fine. Perfectly healthy. And frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here. I’m wasting my time. Can we just… talk about what I can do to prevent things, instead of interrogating me about my bathroom habits?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Mr. Theriot, and I sincerely apologize. I did not intend to make you uncomfortable, and I understand your frustration. You are correct; we should focus on preventative measures, given your concerns about your family history. It seems I was being overly thorough and not listening to your concerns. Perhaps we can shift gears. Would you be willing to let me take a few basic measurements – your height, weight, blood pressure – and then we can discuss lifestyle factors and potential screening tests?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds better. Measurements are fine. I guess. As long as we’re not going to delve into… details. And then talk about what I can do. That’s what I came for. Preventative measures. Yes. That’s good. I just want to be sure. I don't want to end up like my mother.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. That's perfectly reasonable. Let's start with those measurements. If you could step onto the scale for me, please. And then we can take your blood pressure. It will only take a moment. Afterwards, we'll discuss lifestyle factors and potential screening tests. Alright, your height is 181 centimeters, and your weight is 60 kilograms. Blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, which is within the normal range. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. I’m noting everything on your chart. Now, have you had a recent physical exam with any other doctor?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just the standard check-ups when I was a kid, you know, for school. But it’s been… years. Probably a decade. I haven't really needed to see a doctor, honestly. I’m generally pretty healthy. I don't get sick often. I'm more of an indoors person. A bit of a workaholic, if I'm being honest. So no recent exams. Just… me, doing my own thing. Hopefully that's okay.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Theriot. Many people go years without a check-up. Given your family history and the time since your last exam, I would recommend a few basic blood tests to get a baseline understanding of your health. We can check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? Look, I came here worried about… inheriting something serious, and now you're just going to run a bunch of tests. I feel fine. Perfectly healthy. Is this really necessary? I’m starting to think I wasted my time and money. Can we at least talk about what I can do to stay healthy, before you start poking around with needles? Like… diet, exercise, things like that. Please? I’d rather focus on prevention than worry about what might be wrong.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask that, Mr. Theriot. I apologize for pushing ahead with the tests without fully addressing your concerns. You're right to prioritize prevention, and we should definitely focus on that first. I got caught in a routine of wanting to gather all the information, and I'm not listening to you. Let's absolutely talk about lifestyle factors. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… better. A typical day? Well, I wake up, usually pretty late. Around 9, maybe 10. I work from home, I'm an engineer, so it’s a lot of computer work. I sit at my desk for… hours. Honestly, I probably don’t move enough. Lunch is usually takeout, something quick. Then more work. I finish around 6 or 7, and then… I either work more, or watch TV. It's not very exciting, if you're being honest. I don't really have much of a social life. Just work, and… being alone. And takeout. A lot of takeout. I guess. Is that what you wanted to know? It's not exactly a healthy lifestyle, I admit.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you have a very demanding job, and it’s easy for healthy habits to fall by the wayside when you’re busy. The main areas we should focus on are increasing your physical activity, improving your diet, and managing stress. We could start with something small, like a 30-minute walk each day. And perhaps try to incorporate more home-cooked meals into your routine. Even starting with one or two meals a week can make a difference. What do you think?
PATIENT: A walk? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not really a… outdoors person. And cooking? I barely have time to sleep, let alone cook. It sounds… exhausting. But… I guess I could try a walk. Maybe. Just… a short one. And I could try to order healthier takeout, if that's even possible. But I don't know. It just seems… overwhelming. It's not like I have a lot of free time. I’m used to things being a certain way. But… I suppose I can try. For my mother’s sake. If that makes sense. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Something… easier?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. That's a very good attitude, and starting small is the key. You're right; we don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. As for something easier, focusing on stress management can be very helpful. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy?
PATIENT: Hobbies? Not really. I used to… play video games, but I don't really have time for that anymore. Work is… pretty much my life. I guess I find some… satisfaction in solving problems, engineering things. But that’s not exactly a hobby. It's just… what I do. I don't really have any… relaxing activities. Just… work. And takeout. Honestly, I don’t know what a relaxing activity even is anymore. Is that bad? I’m probably just a workaholic.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Theriot, but it’s important to find ways to balance work with activities that you enjoy and that help you relax. Chronic stress can have a negative impact on your health. Perhaps we could explore some simple stress-reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. There are many apps and resources available online that can guide you through these practices. Or maybe re-introducing video games, even for a short period each day, could be helpful. Would you be open to trying any of those?
PATIENT: Mindfulness meditation? That sounds… weird. And frankly, I don’t have the patience for that. Video games… maybe. Just for a little while. But I don’t know. It just seems… pointless. I need to be productive, you know? I can’t just sit around and… relax. It feels like a waste of time. But… I guess I can try the video games. If it gets you off my back. Just for a little while each day. But don’t expect miracles, okay? I’m still going to be a workaholic. I just… don’t know how to not be. Is there anything else I need to do? Maybe… a check-up, eventually? But not right now. I think I need to… process all this first.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. We’ll take things one step at a time. Reintroducing video games, even for a short period each day, is a good start. And if you find that helpful, that’s fantastic. As for a check-up, we can schedule that for a few months down the line, when you’ve had a chance to incorporate some of these changes into your routine. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I’m also going to provide you with some resources on stress management and healthy eating. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Theriot?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. Even though… this was a lot. I still feel a little overwhelmed, but… I guess it’s better than just ignoring things. Maybe. I’ll try the video games. And maybe… try to walk a little bit. Just don’t expect miracles. I appreciate your time. And your patience. I know I’m not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. And you are absolutely not difficult. It's good you are prioritizing your health, and I commend you for taking these first steps. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot.
