DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Bacy, yes? It’s nice to meet you as well. Hmm, what brings me in... well, my tummy feels a bit big, you see? And I don’t feel like eating much these days. It’s just… not the same. I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, Soila, Bacy is correct. And thank you for sharing that with me. A bit big, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit big. It’s hard to explain… like I’ve put on weight, but I haven’t eaten much more. Maybe I have? I don’t really remember. It just feels… full, and uncomfortable sometimes. It’s been going on for… a little while now, I think. A few weeks, maybe? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks of feeling full and uncomfortable, even without a change in your appetite. Okay. And has anything else changed along with this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I feel tired, sometimes. More tired than usual, maybe. And… oh! I go to the bathroom more often, I think. Yes, that’s it. More often. But everything else… I don’t know. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. It’s hard for me to remember things now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Increased fatigue and more frequent bathroom trips, along with the fullness and difficulty remembering things. Let's try to get a little more detail. When you say you go to the bathroom more often, is that during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I think… mostly during the day. Yes, during the day. I wake up a couple of times at night sometimes, but not just to go to the bathroom. It’s hard to say which is more, really. Everything feels mixed up these days. I just know I’m going more than I used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Soila. Thank you for clarifying. And when you go to the bathroom during the day, is it just urine, or are you also having bowel movements more frequently?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That's… a personal question, isn’t it? Well, yes, I go for both, I suppose. Both more often. But the… the tummy part is what worries me most. It just feels so strange. I haven’t changed my diet, and I’m not eating much anyway, so why is my belly getting bigger? It doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to figure out what’s going on, Soila. It doesn’t sound right if your abdomen is getting bigger without changes in your diet or appetite. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. That was a long time ago. Let me see… I had a bad cough when I was young, very young. And… I think I had something with my blood pressure, a long, long time ago. But the doctors fixed it, I think. I don’t remember much else, to be honest. I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I’m not very good with names or dates anymore. Does it matter? It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Soila, it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember the specifics. Any information you can recall is helpful, but we can also work with what we know now. Do you recall ever having any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me think. Yes! I had my appendix out, when I was a young woman. A very long time ago. And… I think I had something done on my eyes, but I was very young, and I don’t remember the details. That’s all I can recall, I think. I’ve had so many little things over the years, but nothing major, I don’t believe. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not just rambling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Soila. Having your appendix removed and something done on your eyes, that’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s a long story. I came from Russia, a very long time ago. I had a mother and a father, and a brother… but they are all gone now. I haven’t seen them in many, many years. I came to this country alone, when I was young. I never married, never had children of my own. It’s just me now. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I don’t have much family to tell you about. It’s all very sad, really.
DOCTOR: It does, Soila. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Now, let’s talk a little about your daily life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And alcohol… well, I had a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, when I was younger. But not anymore. I don’t drink at all now. And drugs? Never! I’m a simple woman, Doctor. I just like to read and take care of my little garden. I don’t have any bad habits, I assure you. Is that what you were wondering about? I try to live a clean life, as best I can.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Soila. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor took me off of it. And sometimes, when my arthritis bothers me, I take a little something from the store, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, I promise. Just when I need it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Do you need a list? I don't really keep track. It’s just the little things, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. No regular medications, just something occasionally for your arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I haven’t been stung by a bee in many years. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I could be wrong. It’s hard for me to remember things like that now. I don’t have any bandages on, or anything, so I haven't had any recent reactions that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. No known allergies. Given everything you’ve told me – the abdominal fullness, fatigue, increased urination, loss of appetite, and difficulty remembering things – I think it would be a good idea to do a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my tummy. It’s been bothering me for a while now, and I’d like to get it sorted out. What will you do? Will it hurt? I hope not.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt, Soila. I’ll just be listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen to see if there’s any tenderness, and checking your reflexes. It’s a pretty standard exam. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Hmm. Your abdomen is a little soft, but there's some fullness in the lower abdomen. It’s tender to the touch here on the left side. And your reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and listen to your abdomen again.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Tender, you say? That’s what’s been bothering me. I knew it wasn’t just my imagination. It’s just… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, but… persistent. Is that bad, Doctor? I hope it’s nothing serious. I’m not a very strong woman anymore, you see. I just want to be comfortable, and able to take care of my little garden. Is my blood pressure okay? It was good last time I checked, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It's good that it's not a sharp pain, Soila. Dull aches can often be managed. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. It’s not drastically high, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Given your symptoms—the abdominal fullness, fatigue, increased urination, loss of appetite, tenderness in your abdomen, difficulty remembering things, and slightly elevated blood pressure—I think we need to do some further testing. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. What will the blood work tell you? Will it be painful? And how long will it take? I have to get home to water my garden, you see. It’s very sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Soila. It’s very common. The blood work will help us check your kidney and liver function, look for signs of infection, and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. It will also help us check your blood sugar levels. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. It usually takes just a few minutes to draw the blood, and then the lab will need a few days to get the results back to us. I'll also need to order a urine test to check for any signs of infection. We can do that right here in the clinic. It will just involve collecting a sample in a cup. Would you be comfortable doing that now?
PATIENT: A urine test… that sounds… less frightening. Yes, I can do that. As long as there aren't any needles involved. I suppose I can manage a cup. Where do I go? And what do I do with it? I don’t want to make a mess. I haven’t been very steady on my feet lately. Is it a special cup?
DOCTOR: No special cup, Soila. I’ll give you a clean cup right here. And there’s a bathroom just down the hall. Just collect a sample in the cup, and then bring it back to me. Don’t worry about making a mess, just do the best you can. And if you need any help, please don’t hesitate to ask the nurse. I'll be right here when you get back. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright… Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try my best. It’s just down the hall, you said? I hope I don’t fall.
