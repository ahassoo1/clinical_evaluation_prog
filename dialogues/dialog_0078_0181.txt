DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness lab panel, if that’s what you mean. Just wanting to get a good look at how things are functioning, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand, Mr. Mombrun. Being proactive about your health is excellent. A wellness panel is a great idea. I see here you requested a comprehensive panel – that includes a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Comprehensive is good, I think. I don't pretend to know all the specifics, of course. I just told the… the young woman on the phone I wanted a thorough check-up. She seemed to understand. Is that a good selection, Doctor? Will it tell us what we need to know?
DOCTOR: It is a very good selection, Mr. Mombrun. It will give us a broad overview of your overall health – how your organs are functioning, check for any signs of inflammation, and assess your cholesterol and thyroid levels. It's a very standard and helpful panel. Before we proceed with the blood draw, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’ve been quite fortunate, actually. I’ve always been a… a sturdy fellow. Never much sick as a boy, and not much trouble as an adult either. I’ve had the usual – colds, a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was maybe ten, but that was decades ago. I’ve worked construction all my life, which keeps a man active, you know. No major injuries, thankfully. A few sprains and strains, but nothing that didn't heal with time and a bit of rest.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A history of good health is a great foundation. So, just to confirm, you had your appendix removed as a child, and aside from that, no other surgeries?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No other surgeries. And no hospitalizations, to speak of. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder, but that was just a cast and a bit of discomfort. Nothing that required… staying overnight, or anything like that. It healed up quite well, I might add. Still feels strong, though I'm a bit more careful on ladders these days.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about your family history, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That's a bit… complicated. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, a good age, but she had some trouble with her heart in her later years. My father… he passed away younger, in his sixties, from what the doctor called a “stroke,” I believe. I have two brothers, both still living. One has high blood pressure, and the other… well, he has diabetes, I think. They haven’t shared much detail, to be honest. We aren’t terribly close. It’s just… life, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. Family dynamics can be complex. So, to summarize, a history of heart issues, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes in your family. That's helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never taken a single pill in my life, if you can believe it. I prefer to rely on good food and hard work to keep me going. And no allergies, either. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything I’m aware of. Not even poison ivy, thankfully. My brothers aren’t so lucky, but I seem to have been spared. I consider myself quite fortunate, truly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. No medications and no allergies are certainly a good thing. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No smoking, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him, so I steered clear from the beginning. As for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A nice red wine, usually. But nothing excessive, mind you. Perhaps one or two glasses a week, if that. I wouldn't say I drink regularly, more like… enjoy it with a good meal. It’s a pleasure, not a habit.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. Moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered acceptable. And how about your diet and exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat a healthy diet, Doctor. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins. My wife, Isabella, she’s a wonderful cook. She makes sure we have a balanced meal every night. And as I mentioned earlier, I’ve been working construction all my life, so I get plenty of exercise. It’s hard work, lifting and carrying and climbing, but it keeps me active and strong. I still enjoy getting out there and doing a good day’s work, even at my age. I walk a good bit as well, when I’m not working. Just around the neighborhood, mostly. Keeps the blood flowing, you understand.
DOCTOR: That sounds excellent, Mr. Mombrun. A healthy diet and regular physical activity are very important. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that gives me a good overview of your health history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A quick examination… no trouble at all. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another… Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to take a look in your ears and throat… open wide, please. Ears are clear. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. And finally, I'll just feel your abdomen. Please relax. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything seems normal, Mr. Mombrun. But, I'll send the blood samples to the lab for more detailed analysis. We’ll have the results back in a few days.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Everything sounding normal is… reassuring, naturally. A few days, you say? That gives Isabella and me time to prepare a nice dinner to celebrate the good news, I suppose. So, what happens next? Do I need to do anything specific? Fasting before the next appointment, perhaps? Or any other precautions? I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a lovely idea, Mr. Mombrun. No, you don't need to do anything specific before the next appointment. The blood draw didn't require any fasting. We'll just review the results when they come back in a few days, and discuss them with you. I will have my nurse call you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or any questions you have before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your attention to detail. I feel quite reassured, to be honest. Just looking forward to hearing the results and… continuing to stay healthy, naturally. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I suppose I’ll be on my way, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your dinner with Isabella! .
