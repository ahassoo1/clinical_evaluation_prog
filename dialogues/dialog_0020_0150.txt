DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get down to it. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure it happens easily. I’m… not getting any younger, you know. And I’d like to avoid any… complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear. You're hoping to conceive and want to ensure a smooth pregnancy, minimizing potential complications. That’s a very reasonable goal. To get a better understanding of how to help you, I’ll need to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. It might seem like a lot, but it'll help me build a picture of your overall health. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Significant? What does that mean? I’ve had the usual things. Childhood illnesses, a tonsillectomy when I was little… a bad bout of the flu a few years back. Nothing important. Honestly, I’m very healthy for my age. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, and I… well, I used to exercise. Is this really necessary? I just want to know if I’m likely to have trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. It can feel like a lot of questions. It's just that even things that seem minor can sometimes be relevant. We want to be as thorough as possible. Okay, let’s put it this way – are there any conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems – that a doctor has ever told you about?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I’m healthy. My ex-husband was always complaining about something, always at the doctor. I never had to be. I've had the usual check-ups, of course, but nothing wrong. And I don’t need a lecture about preventative care, thank you very much. Can we move on? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no diagnosed medical conditions. That's good to know. Let's talk about your family history then. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or problems with pregnancy – in your mother, sisters, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. That’s another thing. My mother… well, she was a worrier. Always convinced she was getting something. She had… something with her stomach, I think. And my aunt, on my father’s side, had breast cancer. But that was ages ago. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. It’s all very depressing. Are you writing all this down? It feels like you're building a case against me having a baby.
DOCTOR: I am taking notes, Angelle, to ensure I have a complete picture. It’s not about building a case against anything, it’s about understanding potential risks. We want to be prepared. Okay, so your mother had stomach issues, and your aunt had breast cancer. Do you know if either of them had any complications during pregnancy?
PATIENT: No! Honestly, I have no idea. My mother didn’t really talk about those things. And I barely knew my aunt. It was… complicated. Look, can we just skip the family history? It’s irrelevant. I'm healthy now. I want to know what I need to do, not what some distant relative suffered through. This is wasting my time. I have a very busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if these questions are feeling intrusive. Family history can sometimes provide valuable clues, but if you truly prefer to skip it, we can. Let's talk about your current lifestyle then. Besides eating reasonably well, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Honestly? A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It helps me relax. And, occasionally, a little something stronger if I'm… stressed. Is that a crime? I don't get falling down drunk, if that's what you're implying. And I certainly don't drink every night. Are we interrogating people now? I thought doctors were supposed to be helpful, not judgmental.
DOCTOR: No one is being judgmental, Angelle. I simply need to understand your lifestyle to provide the best possible care. Knowing your alcohol consumption is important. “Occasionally” can mean different things to different people. Could you give me a rough estimate of how many drinks you have in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Maybe… three or four glasses of wine. Sometimes less. It depends. If I have a stressful week, maybe a little more. But I don't make a habit of it. I’m not an alcoholic, if that’s what you’re fishing for. Can we please move on? This is ridiculous. I feel like I’m being cross-examined. I just want to know if I’m likely to get pregnant easily, and what, if anything, I need to do. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Three to four glasses of wine a week. Thank you for being honest. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I prefer to let my body heal itself. I don’t believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Honestly, I think a healthy diet and a bit of common sense are more effective than anything you can prescribe. Can we please get to the point? I really don't have all day. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. That's good to know. Now, given your age and overall health, it's likely you can conceive. However, it's also true that fertility does decline with age. To get a clearer picture and rule out any potential issues, I would recommend a few basic tests. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. What kind of tests? Blood tests? Internal exams? I really don’t like doctors poking around. Look, I just want to know if I’m likely to have trouble. Can’t you just tell me that based on what I’ve already told you? I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve repeatedly stated. I don’t understand why I need to be subjected to a battery of tests. This is becoming incredibly frustrating. Just tell me if I should worry, or if I can just… try. Is that so difficult?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Angelle. I wouldn't recommend tests if they weren't potentially helpful. A simple blood test can assess your hormone levels and overall health, and a pelvic exam can help rule out any underlying issues that might affect fertility. It's not about assuming you have a problem, it's about being proactive and ensuring the best possible outcome. We could start with a blood test, if you’re comfortable with that. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A blood test. Only a blood test. No poking and prodding, understand? I’m not comfortable with any of that. And I want the results quickly. I don’t want to wait weeks for a piece of paper. Honestly, this is all very… inconvenient. And I expect a clear explanation of what everything means. No medical jargon, please. Just tell me, in plain English, if I’m likely to have a problem, or if I can just get on with things. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Just a blood test to start. I promise we’ll keep it as quick and convenient as possible. And I will absolutely explain the results in plain English, with no medical jargon. I’ll have the lab order sent over now. They're just down the hall. You can go at your convenience, and the results should be back within a few business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the order. I have a very busy schedule, and I really don’t have time for this. Honestly, I hope this is all I need. I’m not a fan of doctors, as you can probably tell. Just… please, get me the order.
