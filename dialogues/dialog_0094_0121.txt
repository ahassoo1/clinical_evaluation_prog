DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don’t know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. And you said this has been going on for a while – can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while… maybe six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away when you get older, you know? Not getting any younger, that’s for sure. It’s just… grittier and grittier, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. Six months, okay. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both of ‘em. Not terrible, but… noticeable. Especially when the wind’s blowin’. Feels like sand, almost. Like somethin’ is in there, even when there ain’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, and it’s worse with the wind. That helps me narrow things down. Do you have any pain with your eyes, or is it mostly just the gritty feeling?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like I gotta blink a lot. And sometimes, things look a little… blurry, but I figured that was just my age too. Old eyes, you know? Never been good with seein’ small things anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, just discomfort and some blurring. It's good you're noticing these changes, Mr. Pipolo. Blurring can be related to age, but we want to make sure there isn't something else contributing. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or changes in your vision besides the blurring – like seeing spots or halos?
PATIENT: Redness… sometimes, maybe? Not real bad. And no, no spots or halos. Just… blurry. Mostly when I’m tryin’ to read the paper. Harder and harder to see the small print these days. I mostly just watch TV now. Easier on the eyes, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional redness, no spots or halos, and the blurring is worse when reading. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ really. Just… old. Doc told me a long time ago my blood pressure was a little high, but that was years ago. I don't take nothin' for it. I try to eat alright, mostly fish. Lived on fish all my life, bein' Aleut. Never bothered with doctors much, to be honest. They usually just tell ya somethin’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. You've generally been healthy, with a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. Fish is excellent—a very healthy diet! And I appreciate your honesty about not being a frequent doctor-goer. We’ll try to be as thorough as possible. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ operated on. Got a bad knee now and then, but that’s just gettin' old, I reckon. Had the flu a couple times, but who hasn’t? Nothin' serious, never been in the hospital. I'm a pretty simple man, Doc. Just want my eyes to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Just some knee pain and occasional flu. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Never been one for pills. My momma always said too much of somethin’ is bad for ya, and I kinda believe her. Just… try to get by. Is this gonna take much longer, Doc? I got a fishin’ show I wanna watch.
DOCTOR: Not much longer, Mr. Pipolo. Just a few more questions, and then I'd like to take a quick look at your eyes. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had no bad reactions to nothin'. Ate all sorts of things growing up, out in the islands. Shellfish, berries… never bothered me none. Honestly, I'm a pretty plain eater now. Fish and potatoes mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And finally, have there been any changes in your family’s medical history that you're aware of – things like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or other eye problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my momma… she had trouble seein’ when she got old. Real blurry, like me. She just kinda… gave up on readin’ and stuff. Didn’t bother goin’ to the doctor either. Didn’t have much money back then. My dad… he was a fisherman. Always healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. Don't think he ever had trouble with his eyes. Can we be done now, Doc? This chair’s not too comfy.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had blurry vision when she got older, and your father was healthy with no known eye problems. Alright, Mr. Pipolo, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam of your eyes. It won't hurt at all. I'll just shine a light in them and ask you to read some letters on a chart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. I got that show comin' on. Hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pipolo, please cover your left eye with your hand. And read me the smallest line of letters you can see on this chart. … Okay, I see you’re having some difficulty with the smaller letters. Now, cover your right eye and read the chart with your left. Alright, it appears your vision is slightly reduced in both eyes, but a bit more so in your left. I’ll also check the pressure in each eye, and then briefly look at the front of your eyes with a special instrument. Just relax and look straight ahead. Okay, the pressure in both eyes is within normal limits. And I’ve briefly examined the front of your eyes—everything appears normal there as well. I do notice some mild dryness of the surface of both eyes.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is somethin' wrong? Is my eyes gonna fall out? Don’t mess around, Doc. I need to know.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pipolo, your eyes are not going to fall out. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re concerned about your health. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you have dry eye disease, which is very common, especially as we get older. The mild dryness I observed supports that. It’s not an emergency, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your vision if left untreated. It's likely contributing to the gritty feeling, the discomfort, and the blurry vision you've experienced. The fact that your mother had similar symptoms could indicate a genetic component as well. Do you understand what I'm saying so far?
PATIENT: Dry eye… like my eyes are just… too dry? That’s it? Not somethin’ serious? That’s good. But what do I do about it? Can you give me somethin’ to make ‘em feel better? I don’t want to keep blinkin’ all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Your eyes aren't producing enough lubrication, or the tears they are producing aren’t of good enough quality. It's very treatable. I recommend starting with artificial tears. These are over-the-counter eye drops that you can use several times a day to help keep your eyes moist. I'd suggest using preservative-free drops if possible, as some people can be sensitive to the preservatives. We can also discuss other options, like a warm compress to help stimulate tear production and possibly a mild ointment to use at night to keep your eyes lubricated while you sleep. I’m going to write you a prescription for a bottle of Systane Ultra, a good preservative-free artificial tear. I’ll also give you instructions on how often to use it and how to apply a warm compress. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Systane… okay. Preservative-free, you said? That's good. I don't wanna mess with nothin' extra. And a warm compress… like a warm washcloth? Sounds easy enough. So, I just put these drops in my eyes when they feel dry? And try the washcloth? That's all? Don't wanna have to go through a lot of trouble, Doc.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You put the Systane drops in your eyes as needed – typically several times a day, especially when you're feeling dry or gritty. There's no strict schedule, just listen to your body. And a warm compress is simply a clean washcloth soaked in warm water – not too hot, just comfortably warm. Apply it to your closed eyelids for about 5-10 minutes, once or twice a day. This helps stimulate the tear glands and loosen any blockages. I’ll also write down these instructions for you to take home, along with information about dry eye disease in general. I’d like to see you back in a month to check how you’re doing. If the drops and warm compresses aren’t providing enough relief, we can discuss other options, such as prescription eye drops or a more specialized treatment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: A month… alright. I can do that. As long as it don’t take too long. Just want to be able to watch my fishin’ shows, you know? And I’ll try the washcloth and the drops. I guess I can do that. Write it down, you said? Good. Don’t trust my old memory too much. Thank ya, Doc. I appreciate ya not messin’ around with too much stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. I understand your priority is to be able to enjoy your fishin’ shows, and I’m happy to help you with that. Here you are. This sheet has everything we discussed, including potential side effects of the Systane drops, although they are generally very well-tolerated. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in vision, pain, or redness, contact us immediately. Have a good day, and enjoy your fishin’ shows!
PATIENT: Thank ya again, Doc. I will. .
