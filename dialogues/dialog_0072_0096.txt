DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 32 years of age. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 32, that’s right. Well, it’s this sensitivity to light, really. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. Makes my eyes feel… well, just really uncomfortable when I’m outside, or even with bright lights indoors. It's a bit of a pain, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity to light…photophobia, as we call it. And how long exactly is “a little while,” Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Probably about three months now? Maybe a little longer. It started off just being annoying, but it's definitely gotten worse lately. I didn't really pay much attention at first, to be honest. It just felt like needing sunglasses a bit more. But now… well, it's more than that.
DOCTOR: More than that. Can you elaborate on how it’s more than that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just needing sunglasses all the time. Sometimes my eyes actually hurt, like a stinging feeling. And things seem… washed out, even with sunglasses on. It’s hard to explain. And sometimes I get a headache with it, right behind my eyes. It makes it hard to concentrate, especially when I'm working. Being a dental assistant, you need good eyesight!
DOCTOR: A dental assistant…right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity, headaches, and…washed-out vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a bit tired lately, but that could just be… life, you know? I lost my wife a little over a year ago, so sleep hasn’t been the easiest thing. But aside from that, no, nothing else comes to mind. No blurry vision, no floaters, no pain when I move my eyes… just the light bothering me, the headache sometimes, and things looking a bit dull.
DOCTOR: I see here you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. And you mentioned the recent loss of your wife—my condolences, Mr. Komarov. While grief can certainly contribute to fatigue and headaches, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes for your current symptoms. Let’s do a quick neurological exam and check your eyes, just to be thorough. Can you follow my pen with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. And thank you for the kind words about my wife. It’s… still hard, to be honest. Yes, I can follow your pen. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Good. Follow the pen…left, right, up, down. Excellent. Now, I’m going to shine a light in each eye. Look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Visual fields appear grossly intact. However, your conjunctiva are slightly pale. And I notice some mild ptosis in your left eyelid—very subtle, but present. This, combined with the pallor, makes me suspect a possible iron deficiency anemia. We’ll need to draw some blood work to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Iron deficiency… I don't know much about that. Is that serious, Doctor? And what does that have to do with my eyes being sensitive to light? I didn't even notice my eyelid being droopy… or my eyes looking pale. I just thought I was tired! Is this something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Mr. Komarov, if left untreated. Anemia means your body isn't producing enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your tissues, and that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches… and sensitivity to light. The pallor—the paleness of your conjunctiva—is a sign of decreased blood flow. As for the ptosis, the drooping eyelid, that can sometimes occur with certain types of anemia due to muscle weakness. We’ll order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel to get a clearer picture. For now, I recommend increasing your dietary iron intake – lean meats, leafy green vegetables, fortified cereals. But we need the lab results to determine the best course of action. Do you have any history of gastrointestinal issues, like ulcers or bleeding?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get heartburn sometimes, but nothing major. And I haven’t noticed any… blood in my stool or anything like that. I try to eat pretty healthy, to be honest, but I guess I could try to eat more leafy greens. What kind of leafy greens are best, Doctor? I always get confused. Spinach? Kale? And what about vitamins? Would an iron supplement help in the meantime? I just want to feel normal again. It’s been a tough year, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a “tough year” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Komarov. Spinach and kale are good choices. Dark, leafy greens, generally. As for an iron supplement… I would not recommend self-treating with supplements at this time. Too much iron can be harmful. We need to know your baseline iron levels before starting any supplementation. I’m ordering the blood work now. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, continue to eat a balanced diet and…try to manage your stress levels. I'll also put in an order for a referral to an ophthalmologist, just to rule out any other underlying ocular causes for your sensitivity to light. Better to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That makes sense. No supplements until we know more. I understand. Stress… that's a bit harder, to be honest. But I’ll try. An ophthalmologist too? That sounds… good. Just covering all the bases, right? Um… yes, I guess I have one question. Will these tests take long to get back? I have a bit of a busy schedule with work, and I don't want to be waiting around too long for answers. And will the insurance cover everything? I'm on Medicare, so I worry about those kinds of things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Komarov, Medicare should cover the necessary testing, but you may have a co-pay or deductible. You’ll need to verify with your insurance provider. As for how long the tests will take, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the results to come back. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the appointment. However, with the current workload, it could be a few days longer. I understand your busy schedule, but these tests are essential for determining the cause of your symptoms. We’ve covered everything for today. If you experience any sudden changes in vision or severe headaches, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you back here once the lab results are available. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. I'll call the lab and see about scheduling an appointment. And I'll try not to worry too much until we have the results. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Komarov. Take care. .
