DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Rakosky. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Please, call me Mirriam. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Been going on for…oh, goodness, a few days now, at least. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, when you’re my age!
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that they'd be bothersome, Mirriam. And certainly not something to be embarrassed about – hiccups can be quite persistent. A few days is a bit longer than usual, so we'll certainly want to look into this. Could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they're…normal hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk of the chest, and then you gasp for air. They come and go, but mostly come. Sometimes they're just a single one, then a few in a row. It doesn't hurt, just…irritating. And they’re worse when I try to lie down. That’s when they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright, “normal hiccups” that are worse when lying down. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, Mirriam?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so, not really. I haven’t been eating anything unusual. And I haven't been particularly stressed, either. It’s been a quiet few days, actually. I was gardening yesterday, and I didn’t notice them then, but they started up again this morning after breakfast. Maybe it was the toast? Though I eat toast every morning…
DOCTOR: Okay, so no obvious triggers, and breakfast toast doesn't seem likely. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, besides the hiccups, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, nothing else really. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing, no feeling sick to my stomach. Just… the hiccups. My appetite is fine, and I’ve been sleeping alright, even with them bothering me when I first lie down. Though I do get a little tired easier these days, but that’s probably just getting older, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s very possible, Mirriam. It's good to hear you’re not experiencing any other concerning symptoms. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And I had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago? Apart from that… not much, really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I did work as a psychiatric aide for many years, so I’m generally pretty healthy – have to be, to deal with all that!
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy twenty years ago. And a demanding profession requiring good health – that’s good to hear. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the blood pressure pills. A small white one, once a day. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a little low last year. That's all. I try to eat healthy, but you can never be too careful, can you?
DOCTOR: Certainly not. And that's good adherence to your medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been lucky with allergies. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen sometimes, but nothing major. Never had a bad reaction to any medicine, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis when she got older, and my father had some heart trouble, but he smoked for years, so that’s probably what that was. My brother is fine, as far as I know, just a bit of high cholesterol. Nothing really serious, you know? We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Now, and please forgive me for asking, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I live alone now, after my divorce many years ago. I keep busy with gardening, mostly. And I enjoy reading, and I go to church most Sundays. I don’t drink much, maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I certainly don’t smoke! I try to walk every day, but the heat has been terrible lately, so I haven’t been able to get out as much.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Mirriam. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you're agreeable. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’ll only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up straight and take some deep breaths for me, that would be wonderful. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly felt. Everything appears normal on initial examination, Mirriam. Given your history and the physical exam, it's likely these hiccups are benign and related to some minor irritation of the phrenic nerve. However, to rule out any underlying cause, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will put my mind at ease, then yes, blood tests are fine. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I should do in the meantime, while we wait for the results? Maybe avoid lying down, or something?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mirriam. While we await the results, there are a few things you could try. Elevating your head while you sleep might help, and avoiding large meals or carbonated beverages could also reduce irritation. There are also some simple remedies you could try, like a teaspoon of sugar or a sip of vinegar, but those aren’t scientifically proven. Mostly, try to relax and avoid any unnecessary stress. I’ll also write you a prescription for Baclofen, a muscle relaxant that is sometimes used for persistent hiccups. We can start with a low dose and see if it provides any relief. I’ll also order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. The results should be back in a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Elevating my head… I can manage that. I’ll try to avoid the big meals too. And I'll give the sugar a try – can’t hurt, I suppose. A follow-up appointment sounds perfect. Just let me know when you’re free. Thank you for being so thorough. It’s a relief to know you’re taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It's my pleasure. I always prefer to be thorough, especially with any new symptom. My nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. In the meantime, if your hiccups worsen, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've covered everything very well. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll go get the blood work done and schedule the appointment. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
