DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina. Eighteen, Lithuanian… hmm. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s my breath. It smells… bad. Really bad. I don’t want to be rude, but it’s embarrassing. I just want it fixed, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: "Bad breath," you say. Well, that is inconvenient. It’s good you’re addressing it. It's rarely just a matter of being polite. Now, "quickly" isn’t always realistic in medicine, but we’ll do our best. Has this been a recent development, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Like… months, I guess. Maybe longer? I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing, to be honest. It just got worse recently, and now people are… noticing. It's not like I’m going to be asking everyone what they think of my breath, am I?
DOCTOR: Months, alright. Vague is not helpful, but understandable. People generally don’t go around discussing halitosis. So, let's try to narrow it down. Do you notice it yourself at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. It’s worst in the morning, definitely. And after… well, after lunch, usually. If I have, like, onions or garlic or something. Which, okay, I eat whatever I want, I shouldn’t have to change my whole life for this, right?
DOCTOR: "Shouldn’t have to change your whole life…” Of course not. But sometimes, small adjustments make a significant difference. And frankly, dietary factors are often the most common cause. But we'll rule out other things first. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I just have bad breath. I don’t feel sick or anything. My gums don’t bleed or anything when I brush. I don't know, honestly. I just want you to fix it. Is it, like, some kind of infection?
DOCTOR: "Just fix it…” You young people. Everything is an emergency. An infection is possible, though not necessarily likely. Let’s start with the basics. How often do you brush?
PATIENT: Um… once a day? Sometimes twice, if I have time. Look, I work highway maintenance, okay? It’s not like I sit around pampering my teeth. It’s a physical job. I don’t have hours to spend on… this. Is it going to be expensive to fix?
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance… Right. Well, brushing once a day is… insufficient. Frankly, it's barely adequate. And the fact that you're admitting it's infrequent tells me a great deal. We need to discuss proper oral hygiene. But first, let's rule out anything more serious. Have you had a dental check-up recently?
PATIENT: Recently? No. It's been… a while. Years, probably. Honestly, I don’t really trust dentists. They always try to sell you stuff you don't need. I just figured this was something a doctor could handle, quicker like. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: "Something a doctor could handle…" You really should have seen a dentist first. This is almost certainly a dental issue. However, since you are here, we will perform a brief examination. It won’t be comprehensive, understand. Open wide. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But hurry. And don't tell me I need a root canal or something. I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your gums are slightly inflamed, as I suspected. Some minor plaque buildup. No obvious cavities, but that’s not to say there aren't any. And your tongue... yes, there's a coating. "Mild gingivitis, possible glossitis. Tongue coating present." Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take… nothing. I don’t like taking pills. And honestly, if you’re just going to tell me I need to see a dentist, I’m walking out now. This is ridiculous. I came here for a quick fix, not a lecture and a referral.
DOCTOR: “A quick fix…” You are remarkably resistant to sensible medical advice. Very well. I will be blunt. Your bad breath is almost certainly due to poor oral hygiene and, possibly, a minor infection of the gums. I strongly recommend a dental examination and cleaning. I can provide a referral, but frankly, I doubt they’ll be thrilled to see you after years of neglect. Do you understand the importance of this?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just give me the slip. I’ll… think about it. But I’m not promising anything. This whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve also written a note on the referral detailing my observations. I strongly suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And please, for your own sake, consider improving your oral hygiene. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
