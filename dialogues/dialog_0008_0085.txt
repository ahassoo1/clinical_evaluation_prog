DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my skin. It’s just…changed. Not for the better, naturally. It’s a discoloration, you see. Quite noticeable, really. I don’t usually bother doctors with…cosmetic things, but this is beyond a simple cream, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Discoloration can certainly be concerning. And you're right to get it checked out if it's bothering you and isn't improving with over-the-counter treatments. Can you tell me a bit more about where the discoloration is?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly on my hands, you see. And a bit on my forearms. Though, honestly, it started on my hands. They’re…patchy. Not a uniform color, if that makes sense. And it’s not like a sunburn, certainly not. More…mottled. Really quite unsightly, if I’m being frank. It’s…distressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy discoloration on your hands and forearms, not uniform, and not resembling a sunburn. When did you first notice this mottling?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It was… March, I believe. Yes, March of this year. Right after we returned from visiting my husband’s sister in Florida. We spent a lot of time outdoors, of course, gardening mostly. Though I always wear gloves. Always. So, it shouldn’t be the sun. It just…appeared gradually after that. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully. Though it’s been getting progressively worse, which is why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in March after a trip to Florida where you were gardening, despite wearing gloves, and has been gradually worsening. Has anything specific triggered the worsening—new soaps, lotions, exposure to certain plants, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I use the same products always. I’m very particular about my skincare. And we were gardening with the same plants as every other year! It’s… baffling, really. Honestly, I suspect it’s something… more serious. I read things online, you know. And it’s rarely just a simple rash. Though, I try not to self-diagnose, naturally. It’s just… unsettling to have something change like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're not trying to self-diagnose. The internet can be…unhelpful sometimes. Okay, so consistent skincare routine, same plants as always. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with the discoloration?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No itching, no burning, no pain. That’s what’s so odd about it! It’s just…there. A visual disturbance, mostly. It's not uncomfortable, per se, just…unpleasant to look at. And it’s spreading, very slowly, but definitely spreading. It’s on the backs of my hands mostly, but now it’s starting on my wrists. It really is quite…distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright, no itching, burning, or pain, just the discoloration spreading slowly from the backs of your hands to your wrists. Have you had any other symptoms—fatigue, joint pain, weight loss, anything else at all that’s new or unusual?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Perfectly healthy, otherwise. I walk every morning, I eat a sensible diet… I’m a very disciplined person, you see. Nothing else has changed. No fever, no aches, no… weakness. It truly is just this…skin thing. It's almost… insulting, to have something like this happen when everything else is in such good order. It's probably nothing, but I simply wanted to be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other systemic symptoms. That’s good. Let’s take a look at your hands and forearms. Could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: There you are. You can see it quite clearly, I think. It’s… quite pronounced on the backs of my hands. And it’s slightly raised in some spots, though not much. It doesn’t look like a rash, does it? It’s just…uneven. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous about hand care. It’s simply baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see what you mean. It is patchy and uneven, and there’s a slight elevation in a few spots, but it doesn’t seem particularly inflamed. It's not a typical rash presentation. I’m going to document my findings: patchy discoloration on dorsal hands and forearms, with mild elevation, no erythema or warmth to the touch. No significant lymphadenopathy. Have you ever had anything similar to this before?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Absolutely not. This is a completely new development. I’ve always had very good skin, actually. I used to model, you see, in my younger years. So, I’m quite particular about…maintaining it. To have this happen now…it’s just…disconcerting. Do you think it’s serious, Doctor? I mean, honestly. Is it something… worrying?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior history of similar issues. It’s understandable that you’re concerned, especially given your history of having good skin health. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a form of dermatitis, even without the typical itching or inflammation. It could also be a pigmentary issue, or something less common. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I’m thinking a skin biopsy to look at the cells under a microscope, and perhaps some blood work to rule out any underlying autoimmune conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh. That sounds… rather invasive, doesn’t it? I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I really don’t like the idea of cutting into my skin. But if it will give us a definitive answer… very well. And blood work is… acceptable, I suppose. Though I always bruise easily. Will it be a lot of blood? It's just… I prefer to avoid unnecessary procedures, if possible. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I’m a bit… apprehensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bartock. A biopsy is a relatively minor procedure. We'll numb the area completely before taking a very small sample of skin - it’s usually no larger than a pimple. The blood work will be a standard draw - we’ll take a few vials. I'll give the lab tech a heads-up about your tendency to bruise, and they’ll be extra careful. Let’s start with the blood work today, and schedule the biopsy for next week. That will give us time to discuss the results and any further steps. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood work today, then. And the biopsy next week. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. Although, I truly hope it’s nothing serious. I have… commitments, you see. A great deal of social engagements. I simply can’t be… visibly unwell. Very well, let’s get it over with. Where do I go for the blood work? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fasting, perhaps? I do like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fasting is required for the blood work. You can go directly to the lab just down the hall, room 203. They'll need a copy of your insurance card and a photo ID. I'll fax over the order form now, so they'll be expecting you. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, schedule your biopsy appointment before you leave. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – increased discoloration, itching, pain, or any other new symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Does that cover everything for now?
PATIENT: Yes, that covers everything, I believe. Blood work in room 203, insurance card and ID. And Sarah will schedule the biopsy. Thank you, Doctor. Though, I’m still rather uneasy about it all. I trust your expertise, naturally. But I do wish there was a simpler explanation. I suppose I should simply try to remain calm. Very well. I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if any questions arise before your appointment. And please try not to worry too much until we have some results. I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to remain calm. Thank you for your time. .
