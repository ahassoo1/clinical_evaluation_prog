DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. It's just… not feeling right. I don't remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy feels big” and a decreased appetite. That’s a good place to start. When you say "big," can you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… like… full of water, maybe? Not hard, just… puffy. And it feels… heavy. Like I’m carrying something extra. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s… uncomfortable, but not painful, you understand? Not a sharp pain, anyway. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Soila. “Puffy” and “heavy” are helpful descriptions. And it's good to know it's not sharp pain, just a general discomfort. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I eat… when I feel like it, you know? Not much, like I said. Sometimes I feel a little better after… a small bowl of soup, maybe. But mostly… it’s just the same. I don’t really do much these days, so it’s hard to say if anything makes it worse. I mostly sit and… remember things. Or try to.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s fairly constant, not really tied to activity or specific foods. And you've noticed a decreased appetite along with this fullness. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel habits? Hmm… I… well, things are… slower, I think. Not often, you know? Not like they used to be. I… I don’t talk about these things much. It’s… private. Is that… bad? I forget what is normal anymore. Everything feels… old.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all, Soila. It's very common for things to change as we get older, and it's important for me to know about these things so I can help you. “Slower” is helpful to know. Has there been any blood in your stool, or any change in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my… blood? No, I don't think so. I haven't… looked very closely, if you know what I mean. Everything is just… a blur these days. The color… maybe darker? But I don’t pay much attention. It all looks… the same, after a while. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Soila. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember specifics, and I appreciate you sharing what you do recall. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. And not much… sickness, you know? Just… tired. Always tired. And a little bit of… dizziness sometimes, when I stand up too fast. But that’s been happening for… a long time, I think. I just hold onto the furniture. It's… old age, probably. Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: It could be related to age, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. The dizziness is something we’ll want to look into. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… … A little bit, maybe? Not much. I wear these big shoes, you know? They're comfortable. I don’t really pay attention to my ankles. Everything feels… puffy, all over, I think. Like a balloon. Is that… normal? I feel silly asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Soila. It's good that you're asking questions. "Puffy" is a recurring theme, which is helpful. Okay, one last question for now. Have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight loss? I… I don't know. I haven’t weighed myself in… a very long time. I used to be… bigger, I think. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t really worry about my weight. I just want to feel… better. Is that too much to ask? Everything feels… disappearing. Even my memories, sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Soila. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a number of changes. Okay, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. If you think it will help. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. Everything feels… fragile these days. Like a little bird.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Soila. I will be very gentle. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are a little diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear, but slightly reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No sharp tenderness, but some mild resistance. I hear some… decreased bowel sounds. I don't feel any distinct masses, but there’s a general fullness. Blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 72. Now, I’d like to check your legs for swelling. May I ask you to extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. They ache, you know. Old age. But… do what you need to do. I just want to feel… normal again. If that’s possible. Everything feels… disappearing. Like dust in the wind.
DOCTOR: There is some mild pitting edema in both ankles, about +1 bilaterally. Okay, Soila. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – the abdominal fullness, decreased appetite, weight loss, decreased bowel sounds, and ankle swelling – it sounds like we need to do some further investigation. I'm going to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and liver function. I also want to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at what’s going on in there. It will help us rule out anything serious. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear… I… I don’t think so. I haven’t had… many tests, you know. I try to stay away from doctors, if I can. It all feels… scary. Is it… painful? I… I don't remember what happens in these tests. Everything feels… blurry. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, Soila, it shouldn’t be painful. The CT scan uses X-rays and contrast dye to create detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis. The contrast dye is usually given intravenously – through a vein in your arm. Some people experience a warm sensation or a metallic taste when the dye is injected, but it’s usually temporary. There’s a small risk of an allergic reaction, which is why we'll ask you some questions before the test, and have emergency medication available if needed. Given your age and the fact you haven't had many tests before, I'm going to order an ultrasound of your abdomen first. It doesn't use radiation, and can often give us a good initial look at things. If the ultrasound isn’t conclusive, then we can consider the CT scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an ultrasound sounds… better. No radiation, you say? That sounds… safer. Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. I trust your judgment. I just… want to know what’s going on. It’s… frightening, not knowing. Everything feels… unstable. Like a little boat in a storm.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. It's completely natural to feel frightened when you don't know what's happening. An ultrasound is a good first step. I'm also going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function and a complete blood count. We’ll also check your thyroid levels. I want to be thorough. Now, do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. … I used to take something for… my blood pressure, I think. But that was… a long time ago. The doctor told me to stop, I think. Now… just a little bit of aspirin sometimes, for my… aches and pains. But not every day. Just when it really hurts. And… sometimes a little bit of something for… sleep. But not very often. Everything feels… lost in the fog of time. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. So, aspirin occasionally and something for sleep sometimes. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for sleep?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don't. It was… a little white pill, I think. The doctor prescribed it, but that was… a long time ago. I just have… a little bottle of them. I don’t take them often, because… they make me feel… foggy. Everything feels… distant. Like looking through a veil. It’s hard to grasp onto things anymore. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Soila. Knowing you take something for sleep, even if we don’t know the name yet, is important. We’ll try to identify it later. Okay, and do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? I don't think so. I've never really had… a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… a little bit of a rash sometimes, when I eat… strawberries? But it's not serious. Just a little bit itchy. Everything feels… muted. Like a faded photograph. It’s hard to recall specific details anymore. I’m sorry, I wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. A mild rash with strawberries is good to know. Okay, and finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history? … That was… a long time ago. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. But I don't remember the details. And my father… he was… strong, I think. But he… passed away when I was young. I don't remember much about their illnesses. Everything feels… lost in the shadows of time. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. You’ve given me a lot of valuable information already. It’s understandable that you don’t remember specific details. Okay, to summarize, we’re going to order an ultrasound of your abdomen, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a complete blood count. We’ll also check your thyroid levels. I’m going to have the lab technician draw some blood samples. I’ll also give you a prescription for a stool test to rule out any infections. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a lot of tests. But… if it will help, then… yes. A week, you say? And… what if something is… wrong? I… I get scared easily. Everything feels… fragile. Like a thin piece of glass. Will you… tell me everything? Even if it's… bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Soila. It's natural to feel anxious when facing a lot of uncertainty. We'll take things one step at a time. The tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on, and then we'll discuss all the options. And yes, I promise I will tell you everything, even if it's not what we want to hear. I will explain everything in a way you understand, and we'll make a plan together. We’ll address everything together. I will also be referring you to a gastroenterologist for a consultation after we get the ultrasound results. It’s best to have a specialist involved. Do you have someone who can accompany you to the appointments?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t. Not anymore. Everyone… is gone. I live alone, you see. I’m… used to it. But… sometimes it’s… scary. Everything feels… empty. Like a hollow shell. I can manage, though. I always have. I’m… a strong woman, you see. But… thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. You are a strong woman. And you’re right, you’ve managed very well on your own. We’ll make sure you have all the support you need. I can arrange for a social worker to reach out to you if you’d like. They can provide resources and support services. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood. Then, I’ll give you the prescription for the stool test. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. Everything feels… a little bit less scary now. Just… please be gentle. Everything feels… so fragile. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll let the lab technician know you're ready. Just relax, and we'll take things one step at a time. "Could the lab technician come in, please?
