DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Vodzak. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? Gotta stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Teah. Staying current with immunizations is excellent preventative care. I see here you're 53 years old. Have you had a general check-up with another doctor recently, or is this a new patient visit for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… It’s been a while, honestly. Probably… five or six years? I usually just go when something feels wrong, if that makes sense. So yeah, new patient for you, I guess. I moved here a couple years ago and haven't really settled on a regular doctor yet.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teah. Life gets busy, and it's easy to put these things off. No worries at all. Five or six years since your last check-up… alright. Well, we’ll get you up-to-date as best we can today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly feel pretty good, all things considered. I work construction – building inspections mostly, not the heavy lifting anymore thankfully! – so I’m on my feet a fair bit. No big complaints, really. I get a little achy sometimes, you know, just from getting older. And my knees… well, they talk to me when the weather changes. But nothing I can’t manage.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally feeling well, and it sounds like you keep active! Construction work, even the inspection side, can be demanding. “Knees talking to you” – I understand that perfectly. Many of my patients experience similar things with the weather. Before we go further, could you tell me about any significant medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not that I know of. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago? The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I lost some weight and it went back down, so I stopped taking them. Haven’t had any problems with it since. And… oh! I had a really bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that's about it. Nothing else I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, managed with weight loss, and a bout of the flu. That's good information. Were you ever hospitalized for anything, or have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never been in the hospital. And no surgeries either. Lucky, I guess! My grandma always said strong Tlingit blood keeps a person healthy. Mostly just bumps and bruises from being clumsy, if I'm being honest. Nothing that needed a doctor's attention, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Teah. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate. And I’m sure your genetics play a role too! Now, regarding your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… My mother had diabetes, she got it when she was older. And my uncle, on my dad’s side, had heart problems, had to have a stent put in. Other than that… not really. A lot of folks just lived long lives, you know? Regular aches and pains, but nothing serious that I remember. My dad was a fisherman, strong as an ox, and he never seemed to get sick a day in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your uncle. That's helpful to know. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not a one. I eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medicine. My grandma always said the more you eat, the stronger you get! I’ve been pretty lucky in that department, too. No bee stings or anything like that either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Teah. No known allergies is great. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really bothering me, but that’s it. Nothing regular, just when I need it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. Prefer to let my body heal itself if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That's good to know. Well, Teah, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. Vodzak. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I’m pretty easygoing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Go ahead. I hope it’s not too high, all this talking might have gotten to me!
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly. We'll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Do you have any sensitivities to light?
PATIENT: No sensitivities to light that I know of. My eyes are getting old, but that's just part of getting older, I think. Go right ahead, doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. Your throat looks healthy as well. Your lymph nodes are normal. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back, if you could.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, doctor. Feel free to poke and prod as much as you need to! I trust you.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Everything sounds normal. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. And your strength is good as well. Alright, Teah, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal overall, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we'll monitor. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I recommend a few basic blood tests to get a more complete picture of your health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are probably a good idea. Better to be safe than sorry, right? What kind of tests are we talking about? Just so I know what to expect. And where would I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Exactly, better safe than sorry. I’m thinking a Complete Blood Count to check your overall blood health, a Basic Metabolic Panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar, and a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol levels. These will give us a good baseline. You can get those done at the lab just down the road, at the Rural Health Center. I’ll print you a lab requisition form with the specific tests listed and the address of the lab. It’s a simple blood draw, and usually takes less than an hour. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. CBC, Metabolic Panel, Lipid Panel… I can remember that. And the Rural Health Center… I think I’ve driven past that a few times. A simple blood draw, good. I’m not a fan of needles, but I can manage. No, I think I’m good with those names. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw? Like, should I fast beforehand or anything?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Yes, for the Lipid Panel, it's best to fast for at least 9-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. The other tests don't require fasting, but it's best to drink plenty of water the day before and the day of the draw. I’ll write that clearly on the form for you as well. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. We’ll go over everything together and decide on any further steps, if needed. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Perfect. Fast for 9-12 hours, drink lots of water… I can handle that. Okay, that's clear. And schedule a follow-up… alright. Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Vodzak. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be thinking about right now, or are we all set?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I’m glad I could help. For now, just focus on getting those blood tests done. And remember, even small changes in your lifestyle, like regular exercise and a healthy diet, can make a big difference. As we discussed, slightly elevated blood pressure, so let’s monitor that. No other immediate concerns at this point. Do you have any questions about insurance or the cost of the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit of a complicated subject. I haven’t really got insurance right now, honestly. Just haven’t gotten around to it. I’m hoping they don’t cost an arm and a leg. Do you have any idea roughly what they might cost? I’m on a fixed income, so I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Unfortunately, without knowing your specific plan, it's difficult to give you an exact cost. However, I can call the lab and ask about their self-pay rates. They often have discounted prices for patients without insurance. Let me make a quick call and see what I can find out for you. Okay, I spoke with the lab. The CBC and Metabolic Panel are each around $60-$80, and the Lipid Panel is about $100. They do offer a 10% discount if you pay in cash upfront. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than nothing. We can also explore some local assistance programs if needed, to help with the cost. Would you like me to give you information on those programs?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… helpful to know, actually. $60-$80 and $100… so, around $240-$260 total? That's not terrible, but it's still a bit of a chunk. The 10% discount is good to hear, though. I think I can manage that if I cut back on a few things. Local assistance programs… yes, that might be good to have the information, just in case. I'd appreciate that. I'd rather not have to ask for help if I don't need it, but it's good to know the option is there. Thank you, Dr. Vodzak. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the information on the local assistance programs. They may be able to provide financial assistance or reduced rates for lab tests. It’s worth checking to see if you qualify. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and for looking into the assistance programs. I think I’m all set for now. I’ll schedule the blood tests and get those done as soon as possible. Thank you again, Dr. Vodzak. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. It was nice meeting you as well. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, take care of yourself and don’t push yourself too hard. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please drive safely.
PATIENT: .
