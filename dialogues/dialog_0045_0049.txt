DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s me ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Everything's a bit muffled, like talking underwater, almost. Not sure when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time now, though.
DOCTOR: Muffled, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, muffled. And sometimes… sometimes it’s like a ringing. Not a loud ringing, mind you. More of a… a faint hum. It’s bothersome, especially when it’s quiet. Do you… understand what I mean? It's hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Right, ringing. Tinnitus, we call it. How long would you say you've been noticing this ringing?
PATIENT: Tinnitus? Oh, fancy name for it. Well, the ringing… goodness. That’s a tricky one. A while, definitely. Longer than the muffled hearing, I think. Maybe… a couple of years? Hard to say for sure, Doctor. I don't keep track of these things. Used to be able to hear a pin drop, though. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Not like a bang, you know? Just… slowly fading. Like an old radio losing signal. It wasn't a sudden thing, no. It's just… gotten harder and harder to hear folks. Especially the young ones. They mumble so!
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any pain, dizziness, or fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not a bit. And dizziness… well, I get a little unsteady sometimes, but that’s just my legs, you know? Old age creeping up on me. Fullness… hmm. Not really fullness, no. Just… quiet. Everything’s quiet. Like there’s cotton in them, maybe? Does that make sense? I don’t feel anything bad, just… can’t hear as well.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you work or have you worked in a loud environment at any point?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, I did. Worked in a shoe factory, you see. Lots of machines, clanging and whirring all day long. Shoe machine operator, they called it. Did that for… oh, goodness, must’ve been forty years or more. Loud place, it was. Never thought much of it at the time, though. You get used to it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Just the usual, I suppose. A little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave me years ago. Can't remember the name of it now. And… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I take a little something for that sometimes. Medicare covers it, thank goodness. Nothing serious, mind you. Just old age, creeping in.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Though my skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the dry air. No, no allergies, not that I recall. I'm pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. Just want to rule out anything obvious. Can you lean your head towards me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Lean my head? Alright. Do you need me to do anything special? I don’t want to get in the way. My neck gets a little stiff sometimes, so be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Okay… hmm. There’s a bit of cerumen – earwax – in both ears. And the tympanic membranes – that’s your eardrums – look a bit… dull. Not perforated, thankfully, but not as clear as they should be. It's likely contributing to your muffled hearing. We can try to remove the wax. That often helps. It won't fix everything, mind you, especially given your history of working in a noisy environment. But it's a good place to start.
PATIENT: Oh, earwax, you say? Well, that makes sense, I suppose. I don't do much cleaning in there myself. Always worried about poking something in too far. So, you think getting rid of that might help a bit? That would be lovely. And… what about the other thing? The noisy factory? Is there anything you can do for that? It's just… hard to hear folks sometimes. Makes it difficult to follow conversations.
DOCTOR: Well, the noise exposure likely caused some permanent hearing loss. Removing the wax can improve what hearing you do have, but it won't restore lost hearing. We can discuss hearing aids if it continues to be a problem. They’re not a cure-all, and they take some getting used to, but they can make a significant difference for some people. Right now, I’m recommending a cerumen removal procedure. I'll have the nurse come in and do that for you. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I’ve heard about those. Always thought they were for… older folks. I don’t know… sounds a bit complicated. But… if it helps, I suppose I’m willing to try anything. Cerumen removal first, then we can talk about the hearing aids? Alright. That sounds… sensible. As long as it’s not too painful. My ears are rather sensitive, you know. When will the nurse be in?
DOCTOR: She'll be in shortly. It's a very simple procedure, Mrs. Schneer. Just some irrigation. Nothing to worry about. We'll see how you do with the wax removal first, and then we can revisit the hearing aid discussion if necessary. Don’t get too worked up about it right now. It's a long process. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. Just… a bit worried, I suppose. But you seem to know what you’re doing. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you for explaining everything. And… thank you for not laughing at me about the noisy factory. It was a loud place, I tell you. Really loud.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you in a moment.
