DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Teretha, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Teretha. And please, call me Teretha. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a mouthful, isn’t it? I just want to get this sorted, if we can. I have routes to finish today.
DOCTOR: Teretha, then. Very well. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my hands. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? Mostly in my fingers, but sometimes it goes up my arms a bit. It’s been happening on and off for… oh, a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s really annoying when I’m sorting mail, makes it hard to feel what I’m doing.
DOCTOR: Tingling, you say. A couple of weeks. And it interferes with your… mail sorting. Hmm. Are you a… professional mail sorter, or is this a personal hobby?
PATIENT: Professional! Goodness, no hobby. I’m a carrier. With the Postal Service. Been doing it… oh, nearly thirty years now. It’s not easy work, you know? Lots of walking, heavy bags…and now this. It’s just… frustrating. I don't have time for things to be off.
DOCTOR: Thirty years. A considerable amount of physical exertion, then. And is this tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It's worse when I’m working, definitely. Like, if I’m holding a lot of mail, or it’s really cold outside… that makes it much, much worse. When I'm sitting and relaxing, it’s usually not too bad. Not gone completely, but… manageable. Though last night, it was keeping me up a little, even just lying there.
DOCTOR: So, exacerbated by cold and physical activity. And affecting your sleep now. Do you notice any weakness in your hands?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That's a good question. Not exactly weakness, no. It’s more… clumsy, maybe? I drop things more easily. Like, I’ll be sorting through the letters and a stack will slide, you know? Or I’ll fumble with the keys for the boxes. It’s not that I can’t hold things, it’s just… harder. It's just worrying, that’s all. I need my hands for my job!
DOCTOR: Clumsiness. Right. And is this clumsiness present in both hands, or is it more pronounced in one?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s both, but… it’s definitely worse in my right hand. That’s my dominant hand, of course. I do most of the writing and sorting with that one. The left one tingles too, but I haven't dropped as much with it. It’s just… feels like it’s getting worse, you know? I worry it’s something serious. I don’t have insurance, and… well, bills are already hard enough.
DOCTOR: No insurance. Yes, I see. Well, we’ll try to ascertain the cause. Have you experienced any neck pain, shoulder pain, or pain radiating down your arms?
PATIENT: Neck pain… sometimes. Not bad pain, just a little stiff, especially at the end of the day. My shoulders ache a bit too, but that’s probably just from carrying the mailbags. They're not light, you know! And no, no pain radiating down my arms. Just the tingling, mostly in my hands and fingers. Honestly, I thought it might be something with my circulation. Cold weather and all.
DOCTOR: Circulation is a possibility. Let's have a look. If you wouldn't mind, please sit on the examination table, and I'll perform a quick neurological exam. Just a few simple tests to assess your reflexes and strength. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds fine. As long as it's quick, I’d appreciate it. I really need to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please place your hands flat on the table, palms up. And relax. I’m going to test your reflexes in your arms and legs, and assess the strength in your hands and fingers. Don’t resist, just let your arm fall naturally when I tap your tendons. Now, just relax your arm completely. Hmm. Not bad. A little diminished, but within normal limits. Now the left. Slightly diminished on this side as well.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I’m relaxed. Diminished? Is that… bad? I haven't noticed anything particularly wrong with my reflexes before. I just thought it was the cold making my hands clumsy. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Diminished” simply means they are a little weaker than expected, Ms. Uzarski. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. Now, please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Hmm. Grip strength is… adequate, but slightly weaker on the right, as you indicated. And can you spread your fingers wide against resistance?
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing… as tight as I can. It’s a little sore, if I’m honest. And spreading my fingers… It feels… stiff. Like they don’t want to go all the way. Yes, that’s it. Stiff. Is this some kind of arthritis or something? My mother had terrible arthritis in her hands.
DOCTOR: Stiffness and soreness. Your mother's history is relevant. It could be early-stage arthritis, but it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to rule out other possibilities. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Here? Ooh, yes. A little. Not sharp pain, just… achy. It’s been worse when the weather is cold or damp, you know? And after I’ve been sorting a lot of mail. It feels… swollen, sometimes. But I thought it was just from the work. I really hope it’s not arthritis. I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t do my job.
DOCTOR: Swelling and achiness, exacerbated by activity and cold weather. Alright. Given your symptoms, your history, and this examination, I suspect this may be early-stage carpal tunnel syndrome or possibly the beginnings of osteoarthritis. However, to confirm this, we need some further testing. I'm going to order some nerve conduction studies and a set of X-rays to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your hands and wrists. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nerve… conduction studies? And X-rays? Oh dear. I… I don’t know. What do those do? And… how much will that cost? I don’t have insurance, Doctor. I can barely afford the bills as it is. Will it be very expensive?
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction studies will assess how quickly electrical signals travel through the nerves in your hands. It will help us determine if there’s any compression of the nerves, which is common in carpal tunnel syndrome. The X-rays will show us the condition of the bones and joints. I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, I don’t have control over the pricing of these tests. However, I can write you a referral to a facility that offers a discounted rate for uninsured patients. I’ll also see if they have a payment plan available. It’s important to get this diagnosed properly, Ms. Uzarski. Delaying treatment could worsen the condition. It’s better to know what we’re dealing with, even if it involves some expense. Do you agree?
PATIENT: I… I suppose so. It’s just… it’s all so much. And I have my route to finish today. A discounted rate… and a payment plan… Yes, that would be… helpful. Very helpful. Okay, Doctor. Yes. Please write me a referral. And tell me… how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if I can continue working.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the referral for the nerve conduction studies and X-rays. The facility is located about twenty miles south of here. They should be able to schedule you for an appointment within the next week. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back to my office. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms. Use a wrist brace on both hands, especially while sorting mail. And take over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain relief, as directed on the label. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Wrist brace… ibuprofen… No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too serious. And… I hope I can still do my job.
