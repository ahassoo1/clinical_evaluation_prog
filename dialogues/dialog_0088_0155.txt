DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking, really. In my hands. It’s been… well, I don’t rightly know how long. A while. It’s just getting bothersome, you know? Makes things… difficult. I’d like to get it sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shaking in your hands that's been going on for a while. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s mostly when I’m trying to do something. Like, holding a cup… or trying to write. It's not all the time, thankfully. But it… it makes a mess sometimes. I used to be able to fix things, work with my hands, but… not so much anymore. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started. Old age, I suppose. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s more noticeable when you're actively doing something with your hands, and it’s affecting your ability to do those things. And you're wondering if it’s just related to age?
PATIENT: That's about right. Affecting… yeah, that's a good word. Makes things tricky. And honestly, I haven't been to the doctor in… oh, goodness, a long time. I mostly just hoped it would go away on its own. But it hasn't. I used to work at the water plant, you know. Lots of… machinery. Everything needed a steady hand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual thing, and you haven't been to the doctor recently. That’s perfectly alright. We'll figure this out. And working at the water plant sounds like it definitely required a steady hand! Now, besides affecting your hands, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit… tired lately, I suppose. But everyone gets tired, don’t they? And… maybe a little clumsy. Tripped over the rug the other day. But that happens, too. I don’t know if that’s related, though. It could just be… well, me getting older. Everything aches these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tiredness and a bit of clumsiness. It's good you're mentioning these things, even if you’re not sure they’re related. It’s helpful for me to get the whole picture. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Health problems… not really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. But nothing… chronic. I used to have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, a long time ago. But that was years and years ago. The doctor said it was fine after a while. I don't really keep track of these things anymore. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, a broken arm, and some blood pressure issues in the past that were reportedly resolved. Good to know. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not a one. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Never have. Tried some for my arthritis a while back, but they didn’t agree with me. So, I just… deal with it. I don’t see much point in masking the pain, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And you mentioned some arthritis. Is that in your hands, or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly in my knees. And my back. Not so much in my hands. Though, now that I think about it, they do feel a bit stiff sometimes. But that could just be… well, everything. It’s hard to tell anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and back. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was young. That's about it, I think. Nothing else. Nothing major, anyway. Honestly, I try to avoid doctors as much as possible. Never been a fan.
DOCTOR: Alright, just an appendectomy. And I understand your feelings about doctors. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had… well, she had some trouble with her memory in her later years. Something the doctor called dementia, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble. But other than that, not really. A lot of… sturdy Czech folks. Lived long lives, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, dementia in your mother and heart trouble in your father. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about everything. Unless you count dust, but everyone sneezes a little, don't they? I don't think that counts as an allergy. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I'd like to get this sorted out if possible. It's just... tiring to talk about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I appreciate your patience with all the questions, Mr. Jezik. We're almost finished with the history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well, I suppose. If it has to be done. Just… try to be quick, please. I’m not really one for poking and prodding. But alright. Go ahead. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, then check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It's… not as strong as it used to be, I'm afraid. The shaking makes it difficult to grip anything firmly. It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some weakness in your grip. And I can see a slight tremor in your hands, even at rest. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a few simple coordination tests. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, alternating back and forth?
PATIENT: There… it's… harder than it looks. My hand keeps… wandering. It's not as precise as it used to be. I used to be able to do this without even thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some difficulty with coordination as well. Based on your history and this quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Essential Tremor. It's a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands. The weakness and diminished reflexes could be related to age, but we need to rule out other potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to order a neurological consultation with Dr. Ramirez. She's a specialist who can perform a more thorough assessment and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Essential Tremor… Never heard of it. Blood tests… a specialist… Oh dear. More appointments. I suppose it's better to know, though. If that's what it is, then… alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just… try to keep it as quick and simple as possible, please. I'm not getting any younger, you know. I just want to get back to… well, to being able to hold a cup without making a mess. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Jezik. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and the neurology consultation now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood anytime. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointment with Dr. Ramirez for you. She’s excellent, and she'll explain everything thoroughly. In the meantime, please try to avoid activities that exacerbate the shaking. And if it suddenly worsens or you develop any other symptoms, such as difficulty walking or changes in your speech, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… when will I hear back about the tests? And how long will it take to see the specialist? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and weeks. I just want this sorted out, you know? It’s… frustrating, living with this. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. We'll get the tests processed as quickly as possible. You should hear back within a week. And I'll do my best to get you an appointment with Dr. Ramirez within the next two weeks. My nurse will keep you updated on the scheduling. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. I’ll have the nurse come in to assist you. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik. .
