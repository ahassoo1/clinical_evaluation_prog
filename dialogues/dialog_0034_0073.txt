DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist, but fine. It's… my stomach. It just won't stop. It's been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff. Honestly, I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I understand you've been dealing with persistent stomach issues for several weeks and have already tried some over-the-counter remedies. That's helpful to know. Could you describe what you mean by “won’t stop”?
PATIENT: What do you mean what do I mean? Diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. Several times a day. It's… unpleasant. And it’s weakening. I’m losing weight, and frankly, it’s embarrassing. Do I really need to spell it all out for you? Some of us have lives to get back to.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt insensitive, Ms. Woodring. It’s not my intention to make you uncomfortable. It's important for me to gather a complete picture of what you're experiencing, so I can best help you. So, constant diarrhea for several weeks, and you’ve noticed some weight loss. About how many times a day would you say you are having diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I stopped counting after… five. It’s at least that many times a day. Sometimes more. It's not like it's a neat little number, okay? It’s just… constant. And it wakes me up at night. Which is great. I'm exhausted. Are you writing all this down? Because frankly, I don’t want to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything as we speak, Ms. Woodring. Thank you for being so forthcoming, even though it's a difficult subject to discuss. Okay, so at least five times a day, waking you up at night. Has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, I'm not that far gone. If there was blood, I'd be at the emergency room, not wasting my time here. Honestly, the thought… It's just… no. No blood. Just… a lot of… you know. Everything else. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question what’s necessary, Ms. Woodring. We’re trying to rule out different possibilities. No blood is good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m tired, obviously. And… my stomach cramps. A lot. It feels like… twisting. And I’ve been nauseous, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Mostly just… feel sick. Honestly, it's probably just stress. My husband… well, it’s been a year, and things just haven't been the same. But I don't come to a doctor for feelings. This is about my stomach. Can we please focus on that?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if I’m taking too long. It’s important to consider all potential causes, and sometimes stress can certainly contribute to gastrointestinal issues. So, you’re experiencing stomach cramps, nausea, and fatigue, in addition to the diarrhea. Have you noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't been running a temperature, if that’s what you’re asking. And no chills. Look, I’m a practical woman. I know when I'm sick, and this isn't the flu. This is… something else. Something that won't go away. Honestly, I just want a solution. A pill. Something. I don’t have time for a long investigation. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Woodring. I wish I could offer a quick fix right away, and we may get there. But it’s important to understand what we’re dealing with before prescribing anything. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm not allergic to anything. I take the occasional pain reliever, but that’s it. I’m a healthy woman, or was before this started. Look, my husband was a doctor. I know all this stuff. Do I need to list everything I’ve ever taken? Just… no allergies. Can we move on? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your clarity, Ms. Woodring. No known allergies is good to know. And I understand your frustration with the time this is taking. Alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: Honestly? Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s it. Otherwise, just the usual things – colds, flu, nothing serious. My husband always took care of everything. He… he was a wonderful doctor. I really shouldn’t even be here talking about this. This is ridiculous. Can we please just… get to the point? What are you going to do about my stomach? .
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Woodring. It sounds like you relied on your husband heavily, and I understand it's difficult being here without him. Okay, so you had your appendix removed as a teenager, and otherwise, generally healthy. Before we discuss a plan, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
