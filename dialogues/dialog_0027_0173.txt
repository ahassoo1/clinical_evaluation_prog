DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Fazzina, nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been having these chills, and it's a bit worrying. It's not like a cold chill, you know? It just... comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills that come and go… and not necessarily related to a cold?
PATIENT: No, definitely not a cold. I mean, I haven't felt sick, no stuffy nose or anything. Just… cold, then not cold. It's been happening for a few days now, maybe four or five? It’s just… odd.
DOCTOR: Right, odd. Four or five days… and just the chills, nothing else accompanying it?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I haven’t really noticed anything else. No fever, no aches… I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It's just… the chills are what's bothering me. It's kind of unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are they happening at any particular time of day, or is it completely random?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think there’s a pattern, actually. It could happen anytime, morning, afternoon, even in the evening. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. I just notice it when it happens. It's not constant, thankfully. Just… waves, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, waves of chills… not tied to a specific time. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger them, even if it’s not consistent?
PATIENT: You know, that's a tough one. I haven’t really thought about it… I mean, sometimes when I'm sitting still for a while, like watching TV, I might feel one come on. But then other times I’m walking around and it happens. I honestly don’t think there's a trigger. It just… is. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It’s helpful to know there doesn’t seem to be a trigger. It sounds like it's quite random. Let’s move on to some other things, just to get a broader picture. Have you had any other symptoms at all – perhaps a headache, muscle aches, any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: No headaches, thankfully. And no muscle aches either. My appetite's been normal, I think. Maybe a little less, but I figured that’s just because I’ve been a little stressed lately. And no weight changes that I've noticed, no. I mean, I haven’t been weighing myself, but my clothes fit the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite or weight. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it's managed with medication. Aside from that, nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises, I guess! I’m generally pretty healthy. I try to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? Yeah, Lisinopril. I take it every morning. It’s been pretty good, my blood pressure stays pretty stable. I get it refilled regularly with my regular doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. And I haven’t been hospitalized since I was a kid, I think. Just a few overnight stays for tonsillitis when I was little, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then. I'm pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my dad had heart problems, but I’m not sure what exactly. He passed away a few years ago, so I don’t have all the details. Nothing else really comes to mind. My family history isn't super complicated, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had a reaction to any medication. I've taken a few antibiotics in the past, and I've had the flu shot every year, no problems with either. I think I'm pretty safe in that department!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to confirm, you’re currently taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Lisinopril, one tablet every morning. I usually take it with breakfast. I haven’t missed a dose in ages, I’m pretty good about taking my medication. It’s important, you know, with the family history.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take your blood pressure. Then, I'll feel your neck and check your lymph nodes, just to rule anything out. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Absolutely. Whatever you need to do, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. Fazzina.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds normal so far. Your heart and lungs are clear, your temperature is normal, and I didn’t feel any swollen lymph nodes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be from being in the clinic, or just normal variation. Do you have any other symptoms now that you think about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual. But honestly, I chalked that up to stress. My divorce was finalized a few months ago, and it's still… settling in, you know? Just trying to adjust to everything. But no other physical symptoms, just the tiredness and the chills. Is that relevant? I’m not sure if tiredness counts as a symptom.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as a symptom. Stress can definitely manifest physically, and tiredness is a common symptom. It's good you brought that up. Given your history of high blood pressure, the chills, and now the fatigue, I think we should run a few basic blood tests just to be safe. We’ll check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and your thyroid function. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule things out. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, yeah. I appreciate you being thorough, Dr. Fazzina. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Blood tests sound good. Will I need to fast beforehand or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We’ll schedule those for tomorrow morning. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take too long. After we get the results back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and figure out the next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly. Tomorrow morning is fine. No food, just water, got it. And a few days for results… okay. Thank you, Dr. Fazzina. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing anything. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow? Or is that it for today?
DOCTOR: No, that’s it for today. Just remember to fast before the blood draw tomorrow. I’ll have my nurse print out some instructions for you. In the meantime, if your chills get worse, or you develop any new symptoms – like a fever, cough, or body aches – please call the office immediately, don't wait. Otherwise, just try to get some rest and manage your stress as best you can. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Fazzina. I feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. My nurse will be with you in a moment to give you those instructions and schedule the blood draw. If anything changes before tomorrow, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good rest of your day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
