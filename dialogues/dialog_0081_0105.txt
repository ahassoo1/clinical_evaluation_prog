DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t really remember exactly why we’re doing this today, just that it’s… a check-up before the surgery? I've been told a lot of things, and it all kind of blends together.
DOCTOR: A check-up before surgery, yes. That’s… understandable. It can be a lot to process. Let’s try to untangle things a bit, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, that would be great. I appreciate that. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? My wife does most of the remembering for both of us, haha. So, what kind of things are you wanting to know? Is it about my health? Like, if I'm healthy enough?
DOCTOR: Precisely. We need to assess your overall health to determine if you’re a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery, and to minimize any potential risks. Let’s start with the basics. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… medical history. Okay. Honestly, I don't really have much of one. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. I guess I've always been pretty healthy, up until… well, up until now. No big illnesses or anything. I think I had the flu a couple of times, but that’s about it. I don’t really know what you need to know. Do you want to know about my family? My wife might know more about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history…that's…good, in a way. However, it's still important to establish a baseline. Let's move on to family history, then. Do you know if anyone in your family has had conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. He was always tired, and he had to take pills. But I don’t know what it was. And my mom… she had high blood pressure, I remember her complaining about that. She was always careful about her salt. That's all I can really remember, to be honest. My wife could probably tell you more specifics, she's really good with that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, cardiac issues in your father, hypertension in your mother. That's helpful, though we will need more detail eventually. Now, let's talk about your current situation. What is your approximate weight, and how long have you been struggling with weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh… weight. Right. Uh, I think it's around… 260 pounds? Maybe a little more. It fluctuates, you know? And… I’ve been gaining weight for… a long time, I guess. Years. It's kinda crept up on me. It’s been worse the last five years or so, I think. It's hard to say exactly. It's just… been getting harder and harder to lose it. My wife says I should have come in sooner, but… I don’t know. I just kept putting it off.
DOCTOR: Two-hundred and sixty pounds. And gaining weight progressively for the last five years. Do you have any current symptoms related to your weight, such as shortness of breath, joint pain, or difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I get really short of breath just walking up the stairs, and my knees… they ache all the time. Especially at night. And I… I do have trouble sleeping. I wake up a lot. And… I get really tired, even if I’ve had a good night’s sleep. I thought it was just getting old, to be honest. I didn't realize it was probably from the weight. It’s been getting worse lately, that's for sure. I just figured everyone feels that way sometimes.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath, joint pain, fatigue… These are significant symptoms. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I… I used to drink a beer with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. My wife didn’t like it. And I definitely don’t do any… recreational drugs. I don't even know anyone who does. I mostly just watch TV and try to help my wife around the house when I can. I don't really go out much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's do a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health. It's fairly standard procedure, of course, but necessary. Could you please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. A physical exam sounds good. I'm not really scared or anything. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I hope this isn't too embarrassing. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Two-hundred and sixty-three pounds. And your height is listed as five feet ten inches. That puts your BMI at… forty-one point eight. Significantly obese. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay… forty-one point eight? That sounds… high. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. My wife said something about my blood pressure being high sometimes, so… I guess that's not good? I'll just lay here and try not to move. This is a little chilly, though.
DOCTOR: Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, but a murmur is audible. Blood pressure is one hundred sixty over ninety-five. As expected. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the upper quadrants. No palpable masses. Your blood pressure is elevated, and there is a heart murmur. These findings are concerning, but not entirely unexpected given your BMI and symptoms. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid profile, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We also need an EKG to assess your heart function, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot of tests. What does all that mean? Is it bad? My wife will be really worried if I tell her all this. And the heart murmur… that doesn't sound good, does it? Should I be really scared? I just wanted to lose some weight, I didn't realize it was going to be this complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Mr. Kochubey. However, these tests are necessary to determine the extent of any underlying health issues and ensure you're a suitable candidate for surgery. The blood work will tell us about your kidney and liver function, cholesterol levels, and thyroid health. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm, and the chest X-ray will look for any lung problems. The heart murmur…it requires further investigation, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious. It could be benign. But we need to rule out anything significant before proceeding. I'm going to have my nurse draw blood and schedule those tests for you immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uh, no, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife usually handles the medications. She'll probably ask about that when she gets the results, though. Will the tests take a long time? And… will they be painful? I don’t really like needles. I get a little lightheaded sometimes when I get blood drawn.
DOCTOR: The blood draw should be relatively quick, Mr. Kochubey. As for discomfort… it’s a brief pinch, most patients tolerate it without issue. As for lightheadedness… inform the nurse immediately if you start feeling faint. They can have you lie down. The results typically take a few days to come back. Now, I will write up the orders for these tests, and my nurse will be in shortly to assist you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Uh… I guess… what if the tests show something really bad? Like… what if I'm not healthy enough for the surgery? Then what? My wife really wants me to do this… she thinks it'll make me feel better. But if I'm too sick… I don't want to put myself through all that for nothing. And what if… something happens during the surgery? I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, you are understandably anxious, but dwelling on hypothetical worst-case scenarios is unproductive. If the tests reveal significant health concerns, we will discuss all available options, including medical management and potentially delaying or foregoing surgery. All surgical procedures carry inherent risks, but bariatric surgery is generally safe when performed by experienced surgeons in appropriate candidates. We take every precaution to minimize those risks. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Now, please try to remain calm. The nurse will be with you shortly to assist you with the blood draw. .
