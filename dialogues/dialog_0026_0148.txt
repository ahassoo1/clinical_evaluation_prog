DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh… well. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having… pain. Down there. In… that area. It’s difficult to explain, and I don't really… remember when it started, exactly. It just is. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Noelani. It's perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed talking about these things, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Don’t worry about remembering exact dates; we’ll figure it out together. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Let me see… it's not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. Sometimes it feels… heavy. And occasionally, a bit of a… throbbing. It comes and goes, and I’m not sure what makes it worse, or better, to be truthful. I… sometimes think it’s worse after I’ve been on my feet a lot, working with the wood, but I can’t be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, heaviness, and sometimes throbbing… that’s helpful. And you mentioned it seems related to being on your feet a lot with your work. Do you feel the pain radiating anywhere else – like your back, hips, or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… radiating… let me think. Yes, actually. Sometimes, I feel a bit of discomfort in my… lower back. Not constantly, but when the pain is there, it seems to extend a little into my lower back. Not my hips or legs, though. Just the back, I believe. It’s… a bit difficult to pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back discomfort along with the pelvic pain… that gives us a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh dear. That’s a good question. Let me see… I haven’t noticed any fever, or anything like that. No nausea. My… bathroom habits seem normal, I suppose. I have felt a bit more tired lately, but I thought that was just from working so hard. Is that something I should mention? I… I apologize if this isn’t very helpful. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No, Noelani, you’re doing perfectly fine. It's very common for things to feel a bit blurry when you’re dealing with discomfort. And yes, feeling more tired is definitely something to mention. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. My medical history… well, it’s not very exciting, thankfully. I’ve been generally healthy, I believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, but that was many years ago. And… I have Medicare, of course. I don’t see the doctor very often, thankfully. I try to stay active with my woodworking. I don’t recall any major illnesses or surgeries since my appendix. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Noelani. Appendix removed, generally healthy, and mostly active. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, that I recall. I can eat all sorts of foods. I haven’t had any issues with bee stings, or poison ivy, or anything like that. I’ve never been diagnosed with any allergies, to my knowledge. But… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain wood finishes, but it’s very mild, and goes away quickly. Is that something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known major allergies, just mild skin irritation with some wood finishes. And you mentioned you're on Medicare. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not regularly. I don’t take anything for high blood pressure, or cholesterol, or anything like that. I sometimes take ibuprofen for aches and pains, if I’ve been working very hard, but that's it. And no vitamins or supplements, either. Just… ibuprofen occasionally. I try to avoid taking medication as much as possible, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional ibuprofen as needed. Now, to help me get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll need to check your abdomen and lower back. It won't be anything uncomfortable, I promise.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s… fine. An exam sounds sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, be gentle, if you don’t mind. As I mentioned, I’m not usually one for… this sort of thing. But if it will help, I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I’ll be very gentle, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm just checking for any tenderness or masses. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, actually. A little bit. Right there… That feels… tender. Not excruciating, but… definitely a bit sensitive. And… there’s a bit of discomfort when you press on that side. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, like I was describing earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Now, I'm just checking your back. Does this feel painful at all?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. It’s not a sharp pain, but… there’s definitely discomfort there. Right around there. It feels… tight, and a little sore. It’s been bothering me on and off for a while, I think. It’s not constant, but… it’s definitely more sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, there is tenderness in your lower left abdomen and some tightness in your lower back. It's difficult to say definitively what's going on without further testing, but your symptoms and the exam findings suggest a few possibilities. It could be muscular strain, but given the tenderness in your abdomen, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and other markers, and I’d also like to schedule an ultrasound of your pelvis to get a better look at your uterus, ovaries, and surrounding structures. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an ultrasound. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and get it taken care of. An ultrasound… will that be uncomfortable? And will the blood work take long? I apologize for asking so many questions. I’m not very good with… medical things, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It's perfectly natural to have questions, and I'm happy to answer them. The ultrasound is generally not uncomfortable. You'll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. It doesn't involve any needles or radiation. The blood work will only take a few minutes, and we should have the results back in a couple of days. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, like heavy lifting, and taking over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen, as needed. If the pain becomes severe, or you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, nausea, or vaginal bleeding, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. No strenuous activity, ibuprofen as needed, and contact you if anything gets worse. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I suppose I should schedule the ultrasound then? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? I really do appreciate your patience with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're right, it can be overwhelming, Noelani. And you're very welcome; I'm happy to help. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to do much preparation. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. For the best results, we usually ask that you drink about 32 ounces of water an hour or so before the appointment, to help fill your bladder, but the scheduling department will confirm those instructions when they call to set up your appointment. I’ll write up the order for the blood work and the ultrasound now. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back, so we can discuss them and make a plan. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: 32 ounces of water… alright, I can manage that. And next week sounds fine for a follow-up appointment. Whatever day is convenient. I just want to know what's going on, and get this sorted out. I… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I suppose… that’s all for today then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the scheduling department call you to set up both appointments. For now, just try to rest, avoid strenuous activity, and drink plenty of fluids. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion and the orders for your tests. I'll see you next week. Have a good day, and please drive safely. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Finco. I will, and I appreciate your help. I hope you have a good day as well. Goodbye. .
