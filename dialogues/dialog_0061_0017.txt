DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Danny. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Kimm, you say? Yes. Well, I need… a checkup. For the… the tryouts. You know, for… sports. It’s… important. I think. My… ex-wife, she said I should get something. A paper. From a doctor. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, a checkup for sports tryouts. A paper from a doctor… that sounds like a physical exam form. No problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted for you. Just to be clear, what sport are the tryouts for?
PATIENT: Sports… Well, it’s… a team thing. A lot of running. And… throwing. Honestly, it doesn’t matter what sport. It’s just… proving I can still do it. You understand. It’s about… showing them. Not that I need to, but… they want a paper. A form. That's all. Is that so hard to understand? I don't remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Danny. It sounds like you’re wanting to demonstrate your fitness for a team, and they require a medical clearance form. No problem at all. To help me fill that out accurately, can you tell me a little more about what kind of physical activity is involved?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… running. Lots of running. And… you have to throw a… a ball. Or something. It's been a while. It's… strenuous. I suppose. They yell a lot. And… there's a net. Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? I just need the paper. I don't know the details. Why does it matter what kind of running? Is it fast running? Slow running? It's running. The important part is I can do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so running and throwing, potentially strenuous. Let's start with your general health then. Have you been feeling generally well recently?
PATIENT: Well… as well as an old man can feel, I suppose. I ache. Everywhere. It's… normal. Been aching for years. It’s the weather, probably. Or… the years. It’s something. I don’t go to doctors often. Never needed to. Until… this. So, yes. I'm… functioning. Does that count as well? I don’t have any… plagues. I think. I haven’t felt any… feverish. Lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, functioning and no fever is good. Aches all over… that's not uncommon. We'll definitely want to take a closer look. Have you had any specific injuries recently, even minor ones, that might be contributing to the aches?
PATIENT: Injuries… Oh, where to begin? You fall when you get older. It happens. I twisted my… ankle, maybe a month ago? Walking the dog. Stupid dog. And my shoulder… I think I pulled it. Reaching for something. It’s… old. Everything is old. I don’t remember specifics. It hurts when I… lift things. Does that count? It’s not… serious. I just rub it. And ignore it. Usually works.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a twisted ankle about a month ago, and shoulder pain with lifting. We'll definitely check those out. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what now? Diabetes? Sounds fancy. Look, I don't go to doctors. I told you. I've been perfectly fine for… well, a long time. I eat… normal food. Maybe too much salt. My ex-wife always complained about the salt. But… no. No fancy diseases. I don't feel sick. My heart… it beats. I think. I haven't fallen down clutching my chest or anything. So, no. No conditions. Absolutely not. Is this going somewhere? Are you trying to tell me something is wrong?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Danny. I’m just gathering information to make sure we complete the form accurately and safely. It's standard procedure. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. That's a good question. Now you're asking the hard ones. Let me think… There was… something. When I was young. A… a growth. They took it out. I think. It was… a long time ago. I was in the hospital. For a little while. But it wasn't… serious. I don’t remember much. It didn’t hurt… too bad. Just… a surgery. That's all. Not recent. I haven't needed anything taken out since then. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a growth removed when you were younger. Do you remember what kind of growth it was or where on your body it was located?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake, Doctor. It was a growth! What does it matter what kind of growth? It was… on my… arm, I think. Or maybe my leg? It was small. And they cut it out. That’s all I remember. Honestly, it was decades ago. I was a young man. I don’t spend my time cataloging my old injuries and… growths. I'm here for a paper for a sports tryout, remember? This is… ridiculous. Do I need to bring my ex-wife in here to explain everything? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Danny. My apologies. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. It’s good to know you had a growth removed, even if we don’t have all the details. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. And I take… nothing. Never needed anything. Maybe I’m allergic to… hospitals? This whole thing is making me itchy. Honestly, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Except maybe… bad coffee. But that’s not an allergy. That’s just… bad coffee. No allergies. Absolutely none. Are we getting anywhere with this paper yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications. Great. Now, to finish up the history part, can you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family… medical history? Oh, boy. Now you’re really asking. Look, my family… they lived. A long time ago. My mother… she died. Old age, I think. My father… he worked. A lot. I don’t remember anyone having… fancy diseases. Maybe heart problems? My uncle… he smoked. A lot. Everyone smoked back then. It was… normal. Honestly, I didn't pay much attention to anyone's medical history. It didn’t really… matter to me. They were… family. They lived and… they didn’t. That's all I remember. I’m sorry. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny, that's perfectly alright. You've given me what you remember, and that's helpful. It sounds like some family history of heart problems and smoking. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I’ve got things to do. A sports tryout, remember? This is taking… forever. Just… be gentle. I’m an old man. And I ache. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Danny. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily concerning, but we should document it. Your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that even mean? Is something… wrong? A murmur? I don’t like the sound of that. My blood pressure is fine. I feel fine. Well, mostly fine. I ache, but that’s normal. Just… be quick, alright? And don’t poke anything. I don’t want anything… poking. This is… unsettling. And I still need this paper.
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears and nose look clear. Your throat looks a little red, but no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Finally, I'm going to check your range of motion in your shoulders and ankles, since you mentioned some pain there. Okay, you have some limited range of motion in both shoulders and your left ankle is tender to the touch. Is the pain constant or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Ouch! See? I told you it hurts! It comes and goes. Mostly when I walk. Or… try to walk. It’s… annoying. And my shoulders… they ache. All the time. They don’t move like they used to. I can’t… reach for things very easily. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to… lift things. A lot of things. Now… not so much. Are we almost done with this… examination? I still haven't seen this paper.
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny. We are almost finished. Based on the exam, you have some limited range of motion and tenderness in your shoulders and left ankle, slightly elevated blood pressure, and a heart murmur. The throat is a little red, but that could be from simple irritation. I’m going to write up a summary of my findings and then we can discuss a plan. I want to be thorough, so I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and prodding? This is… ridiculous. I just need a paper! A simple paper for a sports tryout! I don’t need… tests. I’m an old man, not a… science experiment. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something seriously wrong? I knew it. This is all my ex-wife’s fault. She always said something bad would happen. Look, I don’t want a bunch of… needles. Can't you just… write something down? Say I’m… reasonably fit? And give me the paper? This is… stressful. And I still need that paper.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Danny. I'm not trying to make you jump through hoops. The blood work is just a precaution. It will give us a baseline to work with and ensure you’re safe to participate in strenuous activity. It's a routine check, and it will help me complete the form accurately. The blood work will check things like your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and basic blood counts. It will also help rule out any underlying causes for your aches and pains. It’s just a small amount of blood drawn from your arm. As for the form, I need to have some medical information before I can clear you for participation. I want to make sure you’re healthy and safe. I’m happy to discuss the results with you once they’re available and we can make a plan together. Would you like me to explain any of the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… liver function… kidney what-now? This is all… Greek to me. Look, I don't understand any of this fancy medical jargon. Just… tell me if I'm going to die. Is that too much to ask? Seriously. If I'm healthy enough to play, just say so. And give me the paper. I don’t want a bunch of numbers and… functions. I just need the paper. This is… frustrating. And I still need it! It’s for the… sports. Remember? Are you going to poke me with a needle or not? This is getting ridiculous. My ex-wife is going to laugh.
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny, I understand. Let me reassure you, based on my initial examination, you are not in any immediate danger. The blood work isn’t about finding anything wrong, it’s about getting a more complete picture of your health. Think of it like this: I’m trying to make sure you’re as safe as possible before you start a strenuous activity. The blood work will help me do that. It will give me a baseline, so I can monitor your health moving forward if necessary. Unfortunately, I can't clear you for participation without some basic medical information, and the blood work is the most efficient way to get that. If you’re hesitant about the blood work, we can discuss alternative options, but they may involve a referral to a specialist for more in-depth testing. Would you prefer to discuss a referral, or would you be willing to proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: A specialist? More doctors? More poking? This is a nightmare. Look, fine. Just… get it over with. Do the blood work. But be quick about it. And don’t poke too much. And… tell me the results. As soon as possible. I don’t want to wait forever. And… I still need that paper. This is… incredibly stressful. And I’m blaming my ex-wife for all of this. Just… do it. And then can I please, please, please get the paper?
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny. I understand. We'll get the blood work done quickly, and I'll make sure the results are sent to me as soon as possible. I’ll contact you as soon as I have them. Nurse, can you please draw Danny’s blood?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up. This is ridiculous. And tell them to be gentle. I bruise easily. And… where’s this paper, anyway? Is it just going to magically appear after all this poking and prodding? This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. My ex-wife is going to… never mind. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny. While we wait for the results, let me fill out the initial part of the form with the information we’ve gathered so far. It’ll take just a few minutes. And don’t worry, once the results are back, we’ll discuss them and complete the form together. I’ll make sure you have everything you need for the tryouts. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask.
