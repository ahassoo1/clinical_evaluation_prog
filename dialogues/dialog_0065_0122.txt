DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I have been…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But more often now. And my blood pressure has been…high, the nurse said. I want to understand what is happening. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Forgetfulness, increasing frequency," and elevated blood pressure… Yes, I see. "Small things" can be concerning when they start to interfere with your daily life. To get a better understanding, let’s start with the forgetfulness. Can you give me some specific examples of what you're forgetting?
PATIENT: Certainly. Just yesterday, I made a pot of tea…a very nice Earl Grey. And then…I simply forgot where I put the cup. I searched for ten minutes! It was on the table, right in front of me. Another time, last week, I went to the grocery store for milk and…I came home with bread. No milk. These are…not things I usually do. And names. I struggle with names sometimes, even of people I know well. It is…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Misplacing items, forgetting intended purchases…and difficulty recalling names. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Oh, it is…gradual. Perhaps six months, maybe a little longer? At first, it was just the occasional misplaced key, or forgetting a word. But in the last two or three months, it has become…more noticeable. More frequent. It used to be maybe once a week. Now…almost every other day. It is very…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the memory issues and the blood pressure, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think…my husband, he passed away three years ago. I miss him terribly, of course. But that is not…new. Physically…I tire more easily, perhaps. And sometimes…a little dizziness. Not often, but it happens. And my sleep…it is not as good as it once was. I wake up several times in the night. Nothing…severe, but…noticeable. Is this…important?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important. The fatigue, dizziness, and sleep disturbances... they can all be connected. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. I had pneumonia, a very bad case, about fifteen years ago. It took a long time to recover. And…arthritis in my hands, it is…common for my age, I believe. My doctor, before…he treated me for high cholesterol as well. He prescribed medication, but I stopped taking it a few years ago. I did not like the side effects. And, of course, the high blood pressure. The nurse mentioned my readings were quite high today. I do not recall the exact number.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia fifteen years ago, arthritis, and previous treatment for high cholesterol and hypertension. You stopped the cholesterol medication due to side effects…Do you remember what those side effects were?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Muscle aches, very bad muscle aches. In my legs mostly. And a…stomach upset. It was very unpleasant. My doctor at the time suggested different medication, but I…I simply did not want to take anything anymore. I thought I could manage it with diet and exercise. Perhaps I was foolish.
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish to want to avoid medication if you can, Ms. Alvara. Many people feel that way. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I have always been…lucky, in that regard. A few broken bones as a child, but nothing serious. I have a very strong constitution, usually. That is why these…forgetful episodes are so concerning. It is…uncharacteristic.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, strong constitution… That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother…she became very confused in her later years. The doctors said it was dementia, I believe. She…forgot who we were, eventually. It was very…sad. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had similar problems. It started slowly, then…worsened quickly. I remember my father caring for him, it was…a difficult time.
DOCTOR: I see. A history of dementia in both your mother and uncle… That's important information. And, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live alone, in a small apartment. I used to be very active, I travelled a great deal with my husband. But since he passed…less so. I walk every day, to the market and back. I enjoy reading, and I volunteer at the local library a few times a week. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish. I do not drink alcohol, and I have never smoked. I am…a quiet life.
DOCTOR: A quiet life, but active nonetheless. That's good. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have taken many medications over the years, for colds and flu, and the cholesterol medication, of course. Never had a reaction. That is why I was so…surprised by these memory problems. It is not as if it is a physical ailment. It is…in my head.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Ms. Alvara, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. I want to understand what is happening, and I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I only wish my husband were here, he always asked such good questions.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. I understand. Alright, if you could just sit here for me. First, let's check your blood pressure again. 162 over 94. Still quite elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds on the bases bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a few simple cognitive tests. It will just involve some memory recall and simple calculations. It's a standard part of the assessment.
PATIENT: Very well. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate. It is…strange to think that my memory is being tested. It feels…impersonal. But I understand it is necessary. Do not hesitate to ask if I am unclear about anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. It does feel impersonal, but it’s a way to objectively assess your cognitive function. Alright, let's start with a simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in about five minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple…table…penny. Yes, I have them. They are…simple words. But I will remember them, I think. Do you want me to write them down? It might be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that's not necessary for now. Let's continue. Now, can you tell me the date today?
PATIENT: Today is…August 2nd. The year is…2025. Yes, I am quite certain of that. My granddaughter’s birthday is in September, and I always remember the date. It is…important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a simple calculation. If I have 15 apples and I give 7 to my neighbor, how many apples do I have left?
PATIENT: Fifteen minus seven…that is…eight. I have eight apples left. Yes, I am quite certain. I used to help my husband with the accounts, he was a…very meticulous man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to name three animals. Any animals will do.
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. A…dog, of course. And a…cat. And…a bear. Yes, those are three animals. I used to take my granddaughter to the zoo, she loved the monkeys.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Now, do you remember the three words I asked you to repeat earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. Apple…and…oh dear. I seem to have…forgotten. Table, I think? And…something shiny. A…coin? No. It is…on the tip of my tongue. I am so sorry. It is…very frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. Don’t apologize. It’s not a trick question. It seems you are having some difficulty with short-term recall. Now, I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. Reflexes are normal, but there is mild difficulty with tandem walking. Balance is slightly impaired.
PATIENT: Tandem walking? Is that…walking in a straight line? I do struggle with that, sometimes. I have always been a little clumsy, perhaps. My husband used to tease me about it. But…impaired? That sounds…serious.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Alvara, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Based on your history, symptoms, and the results of the physical and neurological exam, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It could be due to a number of factors, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or a combination of things. Given your family history, this is something we need to take seriously. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Second, a thyroid panel, as thyroid dysfunction can sometimes cause cognitive problems. Third, a Vitamin B12 level. And most importantly, I recommend an MRI of the brain to look for any structural abnormalities. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. That sounds…intimidating. But…yes, I suppose so. If it will help understand what is happening, I will do it. Vascular dementia…Alzheimer’s…those are…frightening words. My mother…it was a very difficult time. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed with the tests. What happens next? And…will it be painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. An MRI can be a little unnerving, but it’s not painful. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It’s completely non-invasive. You'll need to remove any metal objects before the scan, but otherwise, it's a relatively simple procedure. I'll write up the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Ramirez, who is a specialist in cognitive disorders. He can interpret the results of the tests and help us determine the best course of treatment. The neurologist will likely want to do some further cognitive testing as well. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle – regular exercise, a balanced diet, and plenty of mental stimulation. I will also give you a list of resources for caregivers, just in case you need them in the future. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers it. You have been very…thorough, Doctor. And patient. I appreciate your kindness. A list of resources…that is…thoughtful. I do not want to think about needing a caregiver yet, but it is…sensible to be prepared. Perhaps…perhaps I should call my granddaughter. She is very good at organizing things. So, blood tests, MRI, and a referral to Dr. Ramirez. I will schedule those appointments as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor Duplichan. You have given me…something to think about. And…a little bit of hope.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could provide some clarity, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have the nurse print out the orders and the resource list for you now. And please, let's stay in communication. We’ll work through this together. .
PATIENT: .
