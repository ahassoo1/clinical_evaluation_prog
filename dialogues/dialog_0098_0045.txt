DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I've been getting...flushed. My face, mostly. It happens sometimes, and it's a little worrying. Not always, you know? Just...comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Flushing, you say. And it's primarily on your face?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the face. And, uh, sometimes my neck too. It's like...getting warm. And red. Not painful, just...warm and red. It started, I think, maybe a month ago? Hard to say exactly. Things get a little blurry sometimes, you know? But a month, give or take.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A month ago, give or take… alright. And would you say anything specifically triggers this flushing, or does it seem to happen randomly?
PATIENT: Randomly, I think. I haven't noticed anything. I eat the same things, do the same things… I don’t drink, and I don’t smoke. I used to walk more, but…well, things changed after my wife passed. It's just...happens. Sometimes when I'm watching TV, sometimes when I'm just sitting. No pattern, Doctor. I really haven’t figured it out.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be very difficult. And it sounds frustrating that you haven’t been able to pinpoint a cause for the flushing. Okay. Besides the flushing, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is difficult. But…we manage. As for other things…hmm. Sometimes I feel a little…lightheaded, maybe? Not dizzy, exactly. Just…not quite right. And my heart feels like it's beating a little faster sometimes when it happens. But it doesn't last long. And I don't get sweaty or anything. Just…warm face, fast heart, a little lightheaded. Not always, though. Like I said, it’s random.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional lightheadedness and a faster heartbeat alongside the flushing. And those don’t always happen, just sometimes. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about your heart before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I saw a doctor when I was younger, for check-ups, but nothing was ever wrong. My wife always took care of the appointments, and she always said everything was fine. After she…well, I haven’t really been to a doctor. This is the first time in a long time, actually. High blood pressure…no. Never heard anything about that. My heart always felt strong, until this started.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. My wife…she took a few things, but I don't. Just…nothing. Plain and simple. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Fruits and vegetables. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And you mentioned you try to eat a healthy diet. Do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with food or anything like that. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. I could eat anything, she said. And I pretty much did! No hives, no swelling, nothing. Just…always fine. I haven't tried anything too strange, but everything normal is okay.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. Just a routine check to get a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My wife always said you need to listen to the doctor. So…go ahead. I’ll just sit here, right? And try to relax. It’s been a long time since I had a check-up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go. Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Your heart rate is also a bit faster than usual, but your lungs sound clear. I see some mild redness on your face, as you described. I don’t see anything else of concern at this time. I want to run a few blood tests just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…good. Blood tests, okay. Whatever you think is best. A little elevated…is that bad? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff. My wife always knew. But…if you think it’s best, go ahead. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood tests are fine.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright not to understand all the medical terminology, Mr. Withycombe. That’s what I’m here for. Elevated blood pressure can be a sign of several things, and we need to investigate further to determine the cause. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels. Do you have any objections to those tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No objections. All those tests…fine. Whatever you need to do. Complete blood count, basic…something, thyroid…everything. My wife always said to listen to the doctor. So…go ahead. I trust you. Just tell me when I need to go somewhere to get them done. I don't drive much anymore, you see. It's a little difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve ordered the tests. You can have them done at the lab just down the street here. I’ll have the receptionist give you a requisition form and directions. They don’t require an appointment, but it’s best to go in the morning before you’ve had anything to eat or drink, except for water. Given your wife's passing and your occasional lightheadedness, and the elevated blood pressure, I would also like to do an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG…is that like the stickers on your chest? My wife had one of those once. Is something wrong with my heart, Doctor? I feel okay, mostly. Just a little flushed sometimes. But…if you think it's best, I'll do it. I just…don't want anything serious. My wife…I miss her. But…yes, do the stickers. If you think it’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, the stickers on your chest. An EKG is a quick and painless test. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong with your heart, Mr. Withycombe. It’s just a precaution, given your symptoms and your wife's passing. It's always best to be thorough. We’ll do that right here in the office. It only takes a few minutes. While we wait for the results, do you mind if I ask a few questions about your daily routine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No problem. Ask whatever you need to. I’ll answer as best I can. It's just…I’m not very good at remembering things sometimes. But I’ll try. Ask away. Stickers first, right? Then questions? Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's do the EKG first. Then we’ll chat while the results print. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. The EKG shows a slightly faster heart rate, but no major abnormalities at this time. It doesn't explain the flushing, but it's good to rule out anything serious. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to ask about your diet. Could you tell me a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Good to hear nothing major. My wife always said worrying makes things worse. A typical day…hmm. Let’s see. Breakfast, usually just toast and a little bit of jam. Sometimes a banana. Lunch…usually a sandwich. Turkey and cheese. And an apple. Dinner…well, I try to cook something healthy. Chicken and vegetables, usually. Or fish. I don’t eat much red meat. And I drink a lot of water. Not much sugar, either. My wife always made sure I ate healthy. I try to keep it that way. Does that make sense? It's not very exciting, I know.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Withycombe. A balanced diet, that's excellent. And you mentioned you drink a lot of water, that's very good. Do you add any salt to your food?
PATIENT: Um…a little bit. Not a lot, but…a little bit. I used to use more, but my wife said it wasn't good for me. So I cut back. Just a pinch, usually. When I cook the chicken, sometimes. And on the sandwich, a little bit. I don’t really taste it much anymore, to be honest. My taste buds aren't what they used to be. Does that matter, Doctor? Is salt bad? I'm just trying to remember what my wife told me. It’s been hard since she…well, you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to not remember everything, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds like you’ve been doing a good job taking care of yourself. A little bit of salt is usually fine, but too much can raise your blood pressure. Now, do you drink any alcohol or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I never liked the taste of alcohol. And my wife…she didn't like smoking. So I never started. Not even a cigarette. I always said it was bad for your health. And she always agreed. So, no. Nothing. Plain and simple. I just…don't like those things. I'm a pretty simple man, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Mr. Withycombe. You've certainly made healthy choices. Now, one last question for now. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…a little bit, maybe. I think I've lost a few pounds. Not much, but…a few. I don’t weigh myself very often. It’s hard to keep track of things, you know? Since my wife…well, things got a little messy. I don't eat as much anymore, I guess. And I don’t walk as much. So maybe a few pounds. I don't know exactly. It’s hard to say, Doctor. Everything is a little blurry these days. But I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam results, it sounds like we’re dealing with a few possible factors here. Your elevated blood pressure is concerning, and the occasional lightheadedness and flushing could be related. The recent weight loss is also something we need to investigate. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health, and we’ll take it from there. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, yes, actually. What could be causing the flushing, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm worried, to be honest. I don't want anything bad. And…will the blood tests hurt? I don’t like needles much. And…what if it is something serious? Will you tell me everything, Doctor? I just…I want to know what’s going on. And…I miss my wife. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Withycombe, and it’s perfectly alright to be worried. As for the flushing, there are several possible causes. It could be related to your blood pressure, but it could also be something else entirely – a reaction to something you’re eating, a side effect of a medication , or even just a temporary change in your body. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately dangerous, but we need to rule out anything serious. The blood tests will only cause a brief pinch, and the nurse is very good at making it as painless as possible. The blood work itself will help us get a clearer picture. And yes, I promise to tell you everything I find, Mr. Withycombe. I’ll explain everything in plain language, and we’ll discuss all your options together. We’ll take this one step at a time. It's completely understandable that you miss your wife, and it's okay to grieve. I’m here to support you through this, and we’ll figure this out together. I'm going to call the nurse to get the lab orders finalized and have her explain the next steps. In the meantime, is there anything else on your mind?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you. You're very kind. Just…getting the tests done, I guess. And…waiting. That's the hardest part. But…thank you. You’ve made me feel a little better, just talking to you. I miss my wife. But…I’ll get the tests done. And I’ll wait. Thank you, Doctor Bombara.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. And you're right, waiting can be the hardest part. But we'll get through this together. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the details of the blood tests, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, I’m here for you. I'll let you get settled, and the nurse will be right in. Take care, Mr. Withycombe.
