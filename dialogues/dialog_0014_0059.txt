DOCTOR: Right, Adyn Swaby. Nineteen years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my speech, Doctor. It's been… a bit off, you see. Not exactly clear, sometimes. It's hard to explain properly. I just… stumble over my words a little. It’s been going on for a bit now, but it feels… worse lately, maybe?
DOCTOR: Worse lately, you say. Hmm. And when you say “a bit off,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… right. It’s like… the words are there, in my head, but they don't always come out right. Sometimes they're… slurred, I suppose? Or… jumbled? It's just… not smooth, you know? It’s hard to… describe, honestly. I don't really remember when it started getting worse, just… that it is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Slurred and jumbled... okay. And is this happening all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not… constant. Some days I barely notice it, and other days… like today, it’s more obvious. It seems to be worse when I'm… tired, I think? Or… maybe when I'm trying to explain something complicated? I’m not sure, really. My memory isn’t the best, you see. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I can recall, really. Work’s been the same – construction management, you know? Husband's been well. No… new medications, I don’t think? Honestly, Doctor, everything feels… normal, apart from the speech. I just wish I could remember when it started to be a problem! It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just follow your finger… without moving my head. Right. I can do that. Please, go ahead. Hopefully I don’t mess it up. My coordination isn’t always the… best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m squeezing now. As tight as I can, Doctor. Is that alright? I try to be careful, I don’t want to… hurt you. It sometimes feels like my hands are a little clumsy. I hope that’s enough.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Strength seems normal. Now, can you say “baseball” for me?
PATIENT: Baseball. There. Is that… alright? I think I said it clearly enough. Sometimes it feels strange saying words, you know? Like my tongue is… heavy, perhaps? But I think that was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright, Doctor? I always feel a little silly breathing deeply like that. But yes, I’m doing it. Hopefully my lungs are cooperating today. I haven’t been feeling unwell, just… the speech, as we said.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds normal so far. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs, and I'll tap a little hammer on your knees.
PATIENT: Alright. Relax my legs… and you’ll tap a little hammer? Oh dear. I always get a bit nervous with those. Please be gentle, Doctor? I’m not very good with… surprises. And I hope my legs cooperate. They don't always do what I tell them.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Now, this is just a formality, but I’d like to ask about any other symptoms. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… Oh, goodness. I do get them sometimes, Doctor. Not very often, thankfully. Just… normal headaches, I suppose? Nothing too severe. They come and go, like everything else. Usually, a little lie-down sorts them out. I don’t really pay much attention to them, if I’m honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any dizziness, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. I think I’ve felt a little off-balance sometimes, but I thought that was just… being tired? Weakness… no, not really. Vision changes… no, nothing that I’ve noticed. Difficulty swallowing… No, I can eat and drink as normal. Everything seems… fine, apart from the speech and the occasional headache. It’s all a bit confusing, isn’t it? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on. Given the slurred speech, occasional headaches and feeling off-balance, I'd like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural issues. It’s just to be cautious. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it… painful? And what are you looking for, exactly? Structural issues… that sounds a little frightening. I hope it’s nothing too bad. I just want to get my speech back to normal. Will it take long? And will it be… expensive?
DOCTOR: No, an MRI isn't painful at all. You’ll just lie in a large machine, and it takes images. It’s a bit noisy, and you need to lie very still. As for what we’re looking for... it could be anything, and most likely it's nothing. We’re just ruling out things like a small stroke, a tumor, or multiple sclerosis. But again, it’s unlikely. As for the cost… that depends on your insurance. The office will handle the billing and let you know what your out-of-pocket expenses will be. We will need a referral from your primary care doctor to get the MRI scheduled. Do you know who that is?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear it’s not painful. Noisy is alright, I suppose. And a small stroke… oh dear. I see. A referral… yes, I think so. It’s Dr. Ramirez, I believe? He’s over on Elm Street. I haven’t seen him in a while, to be honest. Will he need to see me first, or can he just send the referral over? I really just want to get this sorted, and get back to work. This is all a little… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Ramirez. I'll send a referral request to his office electronically. They'll likely want to see you briefly before approving the MRI. I’ll also have the office staff give you the information for the imaging center. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule everything out. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If your speech worsens significantly, or you experience any weakness, numbness, or vision changes, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
