DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, you said? Hmm. Well, I've been… tired. Just awfully tired, lately. More than usual, anyway. And the young man at the lab said something about… my muscles? Something being high. I don't really keep up with all that nonsense, to be honest. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tired” and something about your muscles from the lab results. That's a good place to start. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like… a normal tired, you know? It’s not from working hard in the garden or anything. It just… comes over me. I could be sitting right here, perfectly still, and feel like I’ve run a marathon. And it doesn’t go away with rest. I used to be able to do anything, back when… well, never you mind when. It’s just… different now. I get so… weak.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating to feel tired even with rest, and to have a weakness that’s not related to activity. When did you first start noticing this tiredness and weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It’s all… blurry. Probably… a few months ago? Maybe longer. Time just slips away, you know? It started gradually, I suppose. I just thought I was getting old. Which, of course, I am. But it's gotten worse recently. More frequent, and… stronger. Makes it difficult to… well, do things. Even simple things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months ago, gradually worsening. And it's affecting your ability to do daily activities. Could you give me an example of some of those simple things that are becoming difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… getting out of a chair, for one. I used to spring right up, but now I have to… push. And climbing the steps… absolutely dreadful. My husband, he helps, bless his heart. But it’s… humiliating, really. I used to be so independent. And even… lifting things. A bag of groceries is like a boulder now. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant difficulty with activities that involve strength and mobility. Have you noticed any pain associated with this weakness, or is it purely a feeling of being unable to exert the effort?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes my muscles feel… achy. A dull sort of ache, especially after I’ve been… trying to do something. But it’s not like a pulled muscle or anything. It's just… a heavy feeling. Like they’re full of lead. And they just… don’t want to move.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, achy feeling in your muscles, especially after exertion, but no sharp pain. And you mentioned the lab results showed something about your muscles being high. Do you happen to know what specific tests were done, or what the results were?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. That young man just rattled off a bunch of words I didn't understand. "Creatine… something?" It sounded important, but honestly, I tune most of that out. Numbers and medical jargon… it all just swims around. I just know he said it wasn't a good number. He looked… concerned. My husband will know the specifics. He always does.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. We can certainly review those lab results in more detail. Before we do that, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… the usual aches and pains for a woman my age, of course. Arthritis in my hands, the doctor said. Nothing major. And my blood pressure… it runs a little high sometimes. I take a pill for that. A small white one. I can't remember the name of it. Honestly, I just let my husband manage all of that. He's very good with doctors and medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands and high blood pressure, managed with a small white pill. Do you know roughly when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, years ago. Perhaps… ten years? Maybe more. It’s all a blur. I remember the doctor telling me to watch my salt intake. And to take the pill every day, of course. I’ve been pretty good about that. My husband reminds me. He’s very diligent. It’s… convenient, really. I don't have to worry about remembering everything.
DOCTOR: That's good that you've been consistent with the medication. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. A long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once for a bad bout of pneumonia, when I was younger. But other than that… no. Nothing significant. I’ve always been a healthy woman, until recently. I used to be very active. I did a lot of… work, back when.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a previous episode of pneumonia. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My family… well, we didn’t really talk about medical things. It wasn’t considered polite, I suppose. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. And my father… he just… got old, eventually. A lot of aches and pains. That’s all I really recall. It wasn’t a very… forthcoming family.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s not uncommon. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned a small white pill for your blood pressure. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Just the small white pill. My husband sometimes gives me something for my arthritis, when my hands are particularly sore. But it’s not regular. Just when I need it. A small orange pill, I think. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. He manages everything, really. It’s… easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure and an occasional small orange pill for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I'm very fortunate, in that regard. Though, I haven't taken many medications over the years. Just the necessities, really. I prefer to stay away from pills whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's very helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh dear. Well, I'm retired, of course. I spend most of my time at home. Reading, mostly. And watching television. My husband does most of the gardening now. I used to be very active, as I said, but… things have slowed down considerably. I don’t go out much anymore. It’s… tiring, frankly. And a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly at home, reading and watching television. Before we proceed, is there anything else you think might be relevant to your tiredness and weakness that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, my sleep hasn’t been very good lately. I wake up several times during the night. Just… restless. And I don’t feel very refreshed in the morning. I used to be a very sound sleeper. But now… it's just… fitful. I don’t know if that’s related, but it’s something I've noticed. It’s… irritating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep and feeling unrefreshed in the morning. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and examining your muscles. It won’t be painful, I assure you. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. I don’t particularly like being poked and prodded, but… if it will help determine what’s wrong with me, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My skin is rather sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… perfect. Now, I'm going to feel your pulse… Your pulse is a little fast, actually. And somewhat weak. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished. Now, I’m going to examine your muscles. Your muscles feel quite weak, and there's some tenderness here… And I notice some mild swelling in your lower legs. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Okay. Based on this quick exam, your pulse is fast, your reflexes are diminished, your muscles are weak and tender, and there's some mild swelling in your legs. These findings, combined with your report of tiredness, weakness, restless sleep, and the lab results showing elevated muscle enzymes, suggest several possibilities. We need to look at those lab results more closely. Do you have them with you, or are they at the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This doesn’t sound very good, does it? I certainly don’t have them with me. My husband brought them when he scheduled the appointment. He said they were sent to you electronically, or something. I don’t understand all that technology. He’s very good with computers. He probably told you everything, anyway. He always does. He'll want to know what all this means, of course. He worries so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, your husband sent them over electronically. Let me pull them up now. Okay, here we are. I see elevated creatine kinase levels… significantly elevated, in fact. Also, slightly elevated aldolase. These are muscle enzymes. Their elevation indicates some sort of muscle damage or inflammation. We also see a slightly low albumin level, which can contribute to the swelling in your legs and fatigue. Based on these results, the most likely possibilities include polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which are inflammatory muscle diseases. However, other conditions, such as certain medications, thyroid problems, or even vitamin deficiencies, can also cause similar symptoms. We need to rule those out. Do you recall any new medications you've started recently?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. I told you, I don't take many pills. Just the small white one for my blood pressure. And the occasional orange one for my hands. Nothing new. Absolutely nothing. I haven't changed anything in my routine for a long time. I mostly just stay at home, as I said. It’s… simpler that way. But what is... poly-something-itis? That sounds… dreadful.
DOCTOR: It does sound dreadful, and I understand your concern. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are autoimmune diseases, meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your muscles, causing inflammation and weakness. Dermatomyositis also involves a skin rash, which you don’t currently have, making polymyositis more likely at this point. They can cause fatigue, muscle pain, and difficulty with daily activities, which explains many of your symptoms. However, we need to confirm the diagnosis with further testing. I'd like to order a few blood tests, including an antinuclear antibody test, a rheumatoid factor test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We'll also need to check your thyroid function. And I'd also like to order an electromyography test, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? This is all very… overwhelming. I don't understand all these… complicated words. And I don't like needles. But… if it will help determine what’s wrong with me, then I suppose I have no choice. My husband will want me to get it done, anyway. He's very insistent on following the doctor’s orders. But what does this… electromy-something test involve? Is it painful? I really don't like pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It’s a lot to take in, and I apologize for the overwhelming amount of information. The electromyography test involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can cause a brief, mild discomfort, like a muscle twitch, but it shouldn't be severely painful. It's usually well-tolerated, and the discomfort is temporary. We’ll do our best to make you as comfortable as possible. The blood tests are relatively straightforward – just a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. We’ll also need to check your vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can also contribute to muscle weakness. I’m going to write an order for these tests now. The lab is located just down the hall. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend that you continue to rest and avoid strenuous activities. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, please contact my office immediately. I’ll also prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with muscle pain and inflammation while we await the test results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I’ll do whatever you recommend. Just… please make sure the person doing the tests is gentle. And I really don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. Anti-inflammatory medication sounds good, though. My hands have been particularly sore lately. And… what if it is… that something-itis you mentioned? Is it… serious? My husband will want to know all the details. He worries so much about my health. He’s a good man, but… he tends to catastrophize.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll make a note to request a gentle technician for the EMG and blood tests. And I understand your concern about the potential diagnosis. Polymyositis is a serious condition, but it’s also treatable. With proper treatment, which typically involves corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant medications, we can effectively manage the inflammation and improve your muscle strength and quality of life. It often requires long-term management, but many patients are able to live fulfilling lives with the condition. We need to get the test results first before we can confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. It's important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. In the meantime, try to stay positive and focus on taking care of yourself. We’ll work through this together, step by step. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the test results and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That gives my husband time to research everything, I suppose. He likes to be prepared. And… I suppose I’ll try to stay positive. It’s just… difficult, you know? Feeling so tired and weak all the time. It’s not much of a life, really. And… will this medication interfere with my blood pressure medication? I don’t want to end up with high blood pressure again. My husband keeps a very close eye on that. He's very thorough. Oh, and… will I need to see any specialists? He always wants to know all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand your concerns. It’s certainly difficult to cope with fatigue and weakness, and it’s good that your husband is so involved in your care. Regarding your blood pressure medication, the anti-inflammatory medication I’m prescribing – a low dose of prednisone – can sometimes raise blood pressure. However, it's a low dose, and we’ll monitor your blood pressure closely while you’re taking it. We can adjust the dosage of either medication if necessary. And yes, if the test results confirm a diagnosis of polymyositis, I will refer you to a rheumatologist, a specialist in autoimmune diseases. They will be able to provide specialized care and manage your condition long-term. I'll also likely refer you to a physical therapist to help you regain muscle strength and improve your mobility. I’m going to write a detailed summary of our discussion and the plan for further testing and potential referrals for both you and your husband. I’ll also provide you with a list of resources about polymyositis and autoimmune diseases. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. My head is swimming with all these… complicated words. And I’m sure my husband will have plenty of questions when he reads the summary. He’s very inquisitive. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me. And… thank you for being so patient. I know I’m not the easiest patient. Oh… and… could you please make sure the technicians are gentle? I really don’t want to be poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and you’re not difficult at all. I’m happy to answer any questions you or your husband may have. And yes, I will definitely make a note to request gentle technicians for the tests. Your comfort is my priority. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, Ardelle. And don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this together.
