DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my blood pressure’s been acting up, I reckon. Been feelin’ kinda dizzy sometimes, too. Don’t like it, not one bit.
DOCTOR: “Acting up,” alright. And how long has your blood pressure been… “acting up”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Seems like a couple of months now, maybe longer. Hard to say exactly, you know how it is when you get to be my age. Things kinda… blend together. But definitely noticed it more lately. It worries me, it really does. My husband, bless his heart, he had trouble with that too.
DOCTOR: Right. A couple of months. And has anything changed in those couple of months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I’ve been tryin’ to stick to my usual routine. Still bakin’ everyday, mostly bread and pies for the folks in town. Maybe a little more salt in the bread lately… I don’t know, just tryin’ to make it tasty. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Well, salt can affect blood pressure, yes. So, more salt isn’t ideal. And when you say dizzy, can you describe that a bit?
PATIENT: It’s not a spinny dizzy, if that makes sense. More like… lightheaded. Like I might tip over if I stand up too fast. It doesn't happen every time, just sometimes. And I been drinkin’ plenty of water, so I don’t rightly know what’s causin’ it. It’s just…unsettlin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medication currently, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands, helps with the bakin’. Don’t think it’s that, though. Been takin' it for years. Name’s… oh, dear. It slips my mind. Starts with a ‘V’… No, wait, maybe a ‘C’… It’s a little white pill. I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll figure it out. Do you happen to know your family history regarding blood pressure or heart issues?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, she had a weak heart, I believe. Passed when she was fairly young, though. And like I said, my husband…he struggled with high blood pressure towards the end. Lots of worryin’ for both of ‘em. Never really talked about it much, just kinda… knew. Folks didn’t talk about health like they do now, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just get a quick listen to your heart and check your blood pressure right now. Hmm. 160 over 90. Not great. And your pulse is a little fast. This is higher than it should be.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That don't sound good, does it? I figured it was bad. What does that mean, Doctor? What do we gotta do to fix it? I don’t want to end up like my husband… always worried about his numbers.
DOCTOR: Well, it means we need to get this under control, Ms. Steines. And it starts with lifestyle changes, frankly. Less salt. I know you enjoy your baking, but we need to be realistic. And we'll need to run some blood work to rule out any other underlying issues. We’ll also check your kidneys, as that can affect blood pressure. I’m going to order a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. And I want you to start monitoring your blood pressure at home. I’ll have the nurse show you how.
PATIENT: Home monitoring, huh? I reckon I can manage that. Less salt… that’ll be the hardest part. My customers like a good, flavorful loaf! But I suppose I can try. What about the blood work? Will that take long? And what does that mean, exactly? All these tests… it’s a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: The blood work will take a couple of days to get the results back. It just tells us how your body is functioning—kidney function, cholesterol levels, things like that. It helps us understand why your blood pressure is high. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Steines. And frankly, it's concerning that it's this elevated. We’ll see what the numbers say, and then we'll discuss medication if necessary. But let’s start with the lifestyle changes and the blood work. The nurse will get you set up with the monitor and explain everything. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin’. Just this dizziness, and it ain’t from no medicine. Seems to be…just happens. Alright, lifestyle changes and blood work. I can do that. I always were a stubborn one, though. Hard to change old habits. But I'll try, Doctor. I really will. Just… don’t want to worry my grandkids. They’re all I got left, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, try your best, Ms. Steines. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything. If the dizziness gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Chest pain… I'll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time. And tell the nurse to speak slowly, okay? Sometimes it takes me a minute to get things straight. I’ll see you later, then. .
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be in touch once the results are back. Have a good day, Ms. Steines. .
