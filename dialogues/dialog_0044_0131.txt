DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a little high lately, and my friend told me I should get it checked out. She was worried.
DOCTOR: That’s smart of you – and of your friend – to get it checked out. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on. “A little high” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don't really know the numbers or anything. I bought one of those home machines, you know, the kind you wrap around your arm? And it showed a few readings over 140, I think. Maybe 145 sometimes, when I was stressed. I didn't write them down though, sorry. I just knew it didn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. It’s good you noticed a change and were proactive. Those home machines can be a bit variable, which is why it’s good you came in. A reading over 140 is definitely something we want to investigate further. Let me just pull up your record here...Okay, I see you've had a Medicare wellness visit last year, but no recent blood pressure checks noted. Do you have any other symptoms you've been experiencing, anything at all, even if it doesn’t seem related?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get headaches, but everyone gets headaches, right? And I feel a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours... I do home care, so it’s a lot of running around. I guess I just thought it was from being busy. Nothing new, though.
DOCTOR: You're right, headaches and fatigue are common, especially with a demanding job like home care. It’s good you're able to differentiate what might be normal for you versus something new. Let's talk a bit more about your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat okay… I try to, anyway. And I don't smoke or drink much, just a glass of wine sometimes with dinner. My mom had arthritis, but that’s about it, as far as family history goes. Oh, and she had high cholesterol, now that I think of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, no personal history of chronic conditions, a mother with arthritis and high cholesterol... good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Just a tonsillectomy when I was a little girl, ages and ages ago. Nothing since then. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I’ve avoided the hospital for a long time!
DOCTOR: That is good! It sounds like you've been very fortunate. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty sure, anyway. Never had to take an EpiPen or anything like that. I might get a little itchy sometimes with mosquito bites, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, when they're really bad. Nothing else, I promise. I try to avoid taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That's good to know. Alright, Mykeisha, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your pulse and blood pressure myself. Just to get a baseline. If you could just relax and take some deep breaths... It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. No problem at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear in your lungs, and your heart rhythm is regular. Your pulse is 78 and steady. Now, your blood pressure... interesting. It’s 152 over 92 on your right arm and 148 over 90 on your left. That's elevated, as expected. I also want to check your reflexes and a quick neurological exam, just to rule out anything else going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… a bit high, isn't it? Yes, that's fine. Check whatever you need to check. I just want to know what’s going on and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: It is a bit higher than we'd like, yes, but not alarming. It’s good we’re getting a full picture. Okay, everything looks good neurologically. Your reflexes are normal, strength is equal on both sides, and sensation is intact. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you likely have what we call essential hypertension – high blood pressure without a clear underlying cause. However, to get a clearer picture and rule out any secondary causes, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and look for any other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… essential hypertension. That sounds… serious. But I'm glad we're figuring things out. Yes, blood tests and a urine test sound good. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: It’s good we’re taking steps to understand it, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious. It is serious if left untreated, but very manageable with the right approach. Most people live long, healthy lives with hypertension. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. They should be able to draw the blood and collect a urine sample here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. We may need to monitor your blood pressure at home to get a better understanding of how it fluctuates throughout the day. In the meantime, I recommend a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Low sodium, exercise, and… try not to stress. Easy for you to say! But I can try. What about caffeine? Does that affect blood pressure? And what kind of exercise is best? I do a lot of walking with my clients, does that count?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s easier said than done with a busy job like yours. Caffeine can definitely raise your blood pressure temporarily, so it's best to limit your intake. One or two cups of coffee or tea a day is usually fine for most people, but pay attention to how it makes you feel. As for exercise, walking is excellent! Anything that gets your heart rate up is beneficial. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can discuss specific recommendations once we have your blood work results and understand your overall health status. We’ll also want to discuss lifestyle modifications and possibly medication if your blood pressure remains elevated despite your best efforts. But let's not jump ahead just yet. Let's get these tests done first and go from there. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s do the tests first. I just… I hope it’s not anything too serious. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything really clearly. It makes me feel a bit better knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. It's perfectly normal to be anxious, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have along the way. That’s what I'm here for. Okay, let's get you set up with the lab technician. They'll draw your blood and collect your urine sample. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It will probably be in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Sudden headache, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath… go to the emergency room. Okay, I think I’ve got it. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go see the lab technician now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mykeisha. And remember, we’ll figure this out together.
