DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, you see. Especially in my muscles. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It’s been happening gradually, over the past few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids over the past few months. That is something we should look into. Can you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, with my arms. Just feeling tired more easily when I was, say, lifting things at work. Nothing major, I just put it down to a busy period. But then it started spreading to my legs. Now, even climbing stairs feels… strenuous. And it’s not just physical work, Doctor. Sometimes even holding a cup of coffee feels like too much effort. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. So it began in your arms, has progressed to your legs, and is now affecting even simple tasks like holding a cup. That does sound concerning. And you said it's been gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully. It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I'd say maybe around February? It was very subtle at first, just needing a little longer to recover after a day at work. But over the months, it's definitely gotten worse. It’s not constant, though. Some days are better than others, but it’s always there, lurking in the background.
DOCTOR: Okay, February is helpful. And it fluctuates, some days being better than others. Do you notice anything that specifically makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I haven’t really noticed anything specific that makes it significantly worse, no. Work always seems to make it more noticeable, just because I’m using my muscles all day. But I wouldn’t say it makes it worse as in, a sudden increase in weakness. As for things that make it better… honestly, just resting. A good night’s sleep helps, a bit. But it never fully goes away. I've tried… well, I’ve tried not thinking about it, mostly. Which doesn't really work, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s understandable. It’s difficult to ignore something like that. And resting provides some relief, but it doesn't eliminate the issue. Alright. Let’s talk about your eyelids a bit more. You mentioned they've been drooping. Is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It's both, Doctor. Both eyelids are drooping, yes. It started with my right eye, I think, but now it’s pretty noticeable on both sides. It’s… it’s mostly in the mornings, it's worse when I first wake up. I have to sort of… lift them up a bit to see properly. And throughout the day, they feel… heavy. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, it’s just… uncomfortable. And I’m starting to get a few double visions sometimes, especially when I’m tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyelids, worse in the mornings, a heavy feeling, and some double vision, particularly with fatigue. That’s important information. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the double vision?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, ask away. Hmm… let me think. Other changes in my vision… not that I've specifically noticed, no. My eyesight has always been… mediocre, I suppose. I wear glasses, as you can see. But I haven’t needed a new prescription recently. Everything seems… blurry in the usual way, if that makes sense. No flashes of light, no dark spots, nothing like that. Just the regular blurry vision and now this double vision.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your usual blurry vision with glasses, and the addition of double vision. Good. Now, have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No difficulty swallowing at all. And my voice feels… normal, as far as I can tell. No raspiness, no trouble speaking. I haven’t noticed anything different there, no. It’s a relief that at least something isn’t affected, I suppose. I was starting to worry it was something… serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright. Let’s move on to some medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but nothing major. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, never been hospitalized, and I don’t take any regular medications. I had a check-up a couple of years ago, and everything was fine then. Just the usual advice about diet and exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No prior medical conditions, no hospitalizations, no medications. And a normal check-up a couple of years ago. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I've been quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. Nothing like that. I'm generally a bit… squeamish about hospitals, so I've always avoided them if possible. And, thankfully, I haven’t needed anything serious enough to require surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a bit difficult. My parents… well, my mother passed away a few years ago, from a heart condition, I believe. It was quite sudden. And my father… he has arthritis, I think. He lives back in Sweden, so we don’t talk as much as we used to. I don’t know much about the medical history on either side of the family, to be honest. It wasn’t something we discussed much. I do remember my grandmother having some sort of… muscle weakness when she was older, but I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago. It wasn't particularly severe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart condition in your mother, arthritis in your father, and a vague recollection of muscle weakness in your grandmother. That gives us something to work with. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never smoked. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week, but I don’t drink heavily. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to lead a fairly healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. Considering everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I'll also take a closer look at your eyes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take too long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s necessary. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll explain everything as I go, and we'll take things slowly. First, let's check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table, and let your arms relax?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m sitting down. My arms are relaxed… as relaxed as they can be, anyway. Please, go ahead. I hope it's not too unpleasant. I'm a bit apprehensive, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just relax. That's it. And now the other side. Both reflexes are present, a little diminished, but still present. Now, could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm squeezing. Is that enough? It feels… a little difficult, actually. Not as strong as it used to be, I suspect. I'm trying my best, Doctor. I hope that gives you some indication. It does feel weaker than my right hand, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. You're right, your grip strength is noticeably weaker on your left hand. Now, let's try some simple movements. Can you lift both your arms in front of you, parallel to the floor?
PATIENT: Alright, I’m lifting them. It’s… not easy, Doctor. Especially my left arm. It keeps wanting to drop. It feels… heavy. Is this what you expected? I'm trying to hold them steady, but it's quite a struggle. I can hold it for a few seconds, but I don't think I can maintain it for long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm following your finger. I can see it clearly, I think. No double vision at the moment. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? I'll try to keep my focus as much as possible. It's a little difficult, though, with everything that's going on.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. It won't hurt, but it might be a little bright. Both optic nerves appear normal. Alright. Finally, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, Gedalya, thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the examination, I'm concerned about a possible neuromuscular issue. Specifically, I'm considering myasthenia gravis. It's a condition that causes weakness in the muscles, and it can affect the eyelids, and cause double vision. However, it can have other causes. To confirm this, we’ll need some blood tests and potentially a nerve conduction study. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… gravis? That sounds… serious. Weakness in the muscles… that certainly explains a lot, though. The eyelids, the double vision, the difficulty lifting things… It all fits, I suppose. Blood tests and a… nerve conduction study? Yes, Doctor, I’m definitely comfortable with that. I want to know what's going on, and I trust your judgement. Whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong, I’m willing to do. Is it… is it treatable? That's probably a silly question, but I have to ask.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all. Yes, myasthenia gravis is treatable, although it’s usually a long-term management situation. There are medications that can help improve muscle strength, and in some cases, surgery is an option. We’ll discuss all of that in detail once we have the results of the tests. Okay, I’m going to order the blood tests now. They'll check for specific antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis. The nerve conduction study will assess how well the nerves are transmitting signals to your muscles. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I will also give you a referral to a neurologist who specializes in neuromuscular disorders. They’ll be able to perform the nerve conduction study and help us interpret the results. Would you like me to explain what each test involves in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’m a little anxious, I won’t lie. Knowing what to expect will definitely help me feel more prepared. What does a nerve conduction study actually involve? And what will the blood tests be looking for exactly? Any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with the blood tests. They’re fairly straightforward. A phlebotomist will draw a sample of your blood, just like any other blood test. The lab will be looking for antibodies – specifically, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors and muscle-specific kinase – that are often present in people with myasthenia gravis. If these antibodies are found, it strongly suggests the diagnosis. Now, the nerve conduction study. It’s a little more involved, but it’s not painful. A neurologist will attach small electrodes to your skin – both on the muscles and along the nerves that control those muscles. They’ll then send small electrical impulses through those nerves. The electrodes will measure how quickly those impulses travel to your muscles. If the impulses are traveling slowly, it suggests there’s a problem with the nerve transmission. It will take a little while, and the neurologist will ask you to perform some simple muscle movements during the test. They may also use electromyography, or EMG, which involves inserting a small needle into the muscle to measure its electrical activity. That can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually brief. Do you have any questions about either of those tests so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Small electrical impulses… and the needle for the EMG sounds a bit unpleasant, but I understand it’s necessary. Antibodies in the blood, slow nerve impulses… it’s starting to paint a clearer picture. The neurologist will contact me to schedule the nerve conduction study, you said? And they will explain the process in more detail when I go? Just… how long does it usually take to get the results of these tests? I’m trying not to jump to conclusions, but I’m naturally a bit of a worrier. Is it a matter of days, weeks…? And, if it is myasthenia gravis… what happens next? I know you said there are treatments, but… what does that actually look like? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not apologizing for anything, Gedalya. These are all very reasonable questions, and it’s good that you’re asking them. Typically, the blood test results come back within a week or so. The nerve conduction study usually takes a little longer – maybe two weeks – as it requires a specialist to interpret the results. If it is myasthenia gravis, the treatment will depend on the severity of your symptoms. For mild cases, medications like pyridostigmine can help improve muscle strength by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, which is the neurotransmitter that signals muscles to contract. In more severe cases, other medications – like corticosteroids or immunosuppressants – may be necessary to suppress the immune system, which is attacking the acetylcholine receptors. Sometimes, a thymectomy – surgical removal of the thymus gland – is recommended. The thymus gland is thought to play a role in the development of myasthenia gravis. We’ll discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results of the tests. I’ll also refer you to a support group for people with myasthenia gravis. It can be very helpful to connect with others who are going through the same thing. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at City General Hospital. She’s an expert in neuromuscular disorders, and she’ll be able to answer all of your questions and help us develop a treatment plan. I'll also give you some information about myasthenia gravis to read in the meantime. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… I’ll make a note of that. And a support group… that actually sounds very helpful. It’s good to know there are other people going through the same thing. I think… I think that covers most of my questions for now, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very patient and thorough, and you’ve really put my mind at ease. I still feel anxious, of course, but at least I have a better understanding of what’s going on and what to expect. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll contact Dr. Sharma to schedule an appointment and I'll wait for the lab results. Thank you again, Doctor Solero.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you through this process. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I hope to hear from you soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day as well. Goodbye.
