DOCTOR: Hello, Antoine. Welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It's a problem in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather unpleasant. I’d like to get it sorted, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white coating in your mouth. I understand. That can be concerning, and we want to figure out what’s going on. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: About a week ago, I suppose. It just… appeared. I haven’t been doing anything differently, eating habits are the same, I assure you. It's quite bothersome, especially when trying to maintain a professional appearance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it painful at all?
PATIENT: Painful? No, no. Not painful. More… irritating. It feels rough, you understand? And it looks rather… unsightly. Frankly, it's a distraction.
DOCTOR: Rough, and unsightly… alright. Does it cover the whole mouth, or just certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on the tongue, and the insides of my cheeks. Not… everywhere. Though it is spreading, I believe. It's becoming more noticeable each day, which is precisely why I am here. I haven’t got time for this, you know. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's take a quick look, if you don't mind. Just open wide for me, please. This will just help me get a better idea of what's going on. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. It appears to be a white coating, as you described. It does seem a bit widespread. Do you have any fever, chills, or weight loss associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven’t taken my temperature, frankly. I am a busy man. Chills, no. And weight loss? Absolutely not. I maintain a strict diet and exercise regime. This is probably some minor irritation, honestly. I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Is there a quick remedy for this? Something I can take and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the sort? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. Smoking is a dreadful habit. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your sense of taste?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. And my sense of taste is… adequate. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary, no. This is rather tedious, you know. Are you going to prescribe something or simply continue asking questions? I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. Just a few more questions to rule things out. Have you had any recent infections, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent infections? No! I rarely get sick. I have a very strong immune system. I told you, I maintain a healthy lifestyle. Really, Doctor, this is all very unnecessary. Is this going to take much longer? I have a schedule to keep. Frankly, I suspect it’s just a bit of dryness. Some mouthwash should suffice. Can we just skip to the remedy?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I prefer to maintain a natural state of health. I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. This is wasting my time. Are you going to prescribe something, or should I seek a second opinion? I have other commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Antoine, based on what you’ve told me, it could be a mild case of oral thrush, or a localized infection. However, to be certain, and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to take a swab from the inside of your cheek to send to the lab. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Absolutely not! I do not appreciate being subjected to unnecessary procedures. I’ve told you my symptoms, I’ve explained my lifestyle. It's a minor irritation, I assure you. Prescribe me something for a mild infection, and let me be on my way. I have no time for lab tests. This is preposterous. Honestly, Doctor, I expected better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. If you insist. I'm going to prescribe you a mild antifungal mouthwash to use twice daily for a week. If it doesn’t improve within a few days, or if your symptoms worsen, please come back, and we will need to consider further testing. I also recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding any irritating foods or drinks. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write this prescription?
