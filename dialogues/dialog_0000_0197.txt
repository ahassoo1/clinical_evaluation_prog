DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need a card to drive people around for a ride-share company. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, I believe? I want to get it sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver’s medical card…right. And you need this for a ride-share company?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Uber, Lyft…one of those. They require it now, you see. I don’t want any trouble with the paperwork or anything. It's all very new to me, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s… unusual to come to a general practitioner for this, but I suppose I can assist. It’s not simply a matter of signing a form, you understand. There are specific requirements, a physical examination, and a review of your medical history to ensure you’re fit to drive commercially. We need to be thorough. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, and I take a little medication for high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled. Otherwise, nothing major. I see my regular doctor annually for check-ups. Does that sound like enough information? I can give you names and numbers if you need them.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years post-gallbladder removal is unlikely to be a factor, but the high blood pressure medication… what medication specifically are you taking?
PATIENT: It's Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for…oh, maybe seven or eight years now? It keeps things steady, thankfully. I check my blood pressure at home occasionally and it's usually around 130/80, give or take.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams… Yes, that could be relevant. We need to ensure it's not causing any dizziness or lightheadedness, especially with the demands of driving. And we need to confirm it's been stable. Do you experience any side effects from the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes a little cough, but nothing bothersome. Honestly, I barely notice it most days. I haven't had any dizziness or anything like that. I do get tired easily, but I'm seventy years old, Doctor! I think that's just part of getting older.
DOCTOR: Fatigue can have many causes, Ms. Sciarrotta, and we can’t simply dismiss it. But alright, let’s proceed. Now, have you had any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision. Yes, I got new glasses about six months ago. My old ones were just… worn out, you see. The new ones are much better. I can read okay, and I don’t have any trouble seeing things in the distance. I haven't noticed any blurring or double vision or anything like that. Just… older eyes, I suppose. Do you need the prescription from the optometrist? I can have them send it over.
DOCTOR: New glasses six months ago... that's good. We will need a visual acuity test here today to confirm. Now, have you ever had any problems with your heart?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a bit. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I used to walk a lot, before my knees started acting up. I had a treadmill for years, but I haven’t used it much lately. My regular doctor always says my heart sounds strong. Still ticking, you see!
DOCTOR: Alright. We still need to conduct a thorough physical examination, Ms. Sciarrotta. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. After that, we’ll do a visual acuity test. If you’ll please have a seat.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let's get it over with then, shall we? I’ve got errands to run, you know. Do tell me if this is going to take long.
DOCTOR: It will take some time to be thorough, Ms. Sciarrotta. It's important for your safety, and for the safety of others on the road. Now, please extend your arm. And try to relax. 142/88. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath…and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath... Is that alright? I always feel a bit anxious at the doctor’s office, I suppose. Makes my blood pressure go up.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though your breathing is somewhat shallow. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are… diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let’s check your visual acuity. Please read this chart for me, starting with the top line.
PATIENT: Okay… let me adjust my glasses. Um… F… P… T… O… Oh… D? Is that right? It's a bit blurry, Doctor. I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: You're correct on F, P, and T. "D" is incorrect, it's "C". Your visual acuity is 20/40 in both eyes with correction. That's… less than ideal for commercial driving. Ms. Sciarrotta, based on this preliminary examination, I have some concerns. Your blood pressure is elevated, your visual acuity is below the standard for a commercial driver's license, and your reflexes are diminished. I cannot, in good conscience, issue a medical card at this time.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that's… not good, is it? What does that mean, exactly? Is there anything I can do? I really need to do this… I was counting on this income. Is there some sort of test I can take? Or medication I can try? Please, Doctor… I'm not a young woman anymore, but I’m still capable. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, I understand your concern. However, safety is paramount. The requirements for a commercial driver’s license are strict for a reason. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions causing these issues. I recommend a thorough cardiac evaluation, including an EKG and potentially a stress test, to assess your heart function. We also need a comprehensive eye exam with a referral to an ophthalmologist to determine if your vision can be corrected to meet the standards. As for your blood pressure, we can discuss lifestyle modifications - diet, exercise, stress management – and potentially medication, but it will require a period of monitoring to ensure it's well-controlled. I will provide you with referrals to a cardiologist and an ophthalmologist. You will need to schedule appointments with both specialists. Once I receive the results of their evaluations, we can reassess your eligibility for a medical card. Until then, unfortunately, I cannot clear you to drive commercially. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. It's just… a lot. A cardiologist and an ophthalmologist… and waiting for results… It will take time, won't it? Okay. Yes. Referrals. I'll get the referrals. Do you have them here, or will the office send them? I suppose I should call and schedule those appointments right away. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything to help improve my chances? And… thank you, Doctor, for being honest with me, even if it's not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: Yes, the office will send the referrals electronically to your preferred method of contact, if we have it on file. Otherwise, we will print them for you. In the meantime, focus on a heart-healthy diet – low sodium, low fat, plenty of fruits and vegetables. Regular, moderate exercise is beneficial, but please consult with your primary care physician before starting any new exercise program. And stress management – relaxation techniques, deep breathing exercises, adequate sleep – are crucial for controlling your blood pressure. I also strongly recommend avoiding driving until we have a clearer understanding of your medical status. Here is some information on lifestyle modifications. And please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll assist you in scheduling those appointments. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Referrals, appointments, diet… It's a lot to take in. But… okay. I'll do it. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your honesty. I suppose I'll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Ms. Sciarrotta. And please, prioritize your health. .
