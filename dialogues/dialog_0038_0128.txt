DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think… it’s my joints, I think. They get so stiff in the mornings. It’s just… hard to get going, you know? It's been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: Right, stiff joints in the mornings. I understand. That can be really frustrating. When you say "a while now," would you say it's been weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… months, I think. Yes, definitely months. Maybe… six months? Or more? It’s hard to say for sure. Time just… slips away. It’s not a sudden thing, it just… gradually got worse, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… stuck. Like an old door that needs oiling. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. “Stuck” is a good way to describe it. And gradually worsening over six months is helpful to know. Now, is this stiffness mostly in your hands and feet, or are other joints bothering you too?
PATIENT: Mostly my hands, I think. And my knees… yeah, my knees get a bit creaky too. Not all the time, just when I’m getting up, or after I’ve been sitting for a bit. My feet… sometimes, but not as bad as my hands. It makes it hard to… well, to play with the little ones at work, you know? They want you on the floor! It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands and knees are the main areas, worse in the mornings and after periods of sitting. And it's more discomfort than sharp pain. That’s good information. Do you notice any swelling or redness in those joints, particularly in your hands?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes look a bit… puffy, maybe? But I’m a bit… well, I’ve put on a bit of weight, so it’s hard to tell, you know? Redness… no, I don’t think so. I’d remember that, wouldn’t I? I try to keep things clean, especially at work with the children. No redness, just… stiff. Very stiff.
DOCTOR: Right, no noticeable swelling or redness, just stiffness. Okay. And do you find this stiffness improves with activity, or does it stay the same throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, it gets better when I get moving, definitely. Once I’m up and about, doing things, it loosens up. That’s why I don’t mind work too much, actually. Keeps me going. But first thing in the morning… oh, it’s hard! Like trying to bend rusty metal. It takes a while to warm up, you know? It’s just… uncomfortable until I get going. Then it’s alright. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it improves with activity, which is good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Not that I know of, really. I had… something with my heart a long time ago, I think. But the doctor said it was alright, just to take it easy. That was… years ago. And I get a bit tired, but doesn't everyone? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. I try to eat healthy, but I do like a little sweet treat now and then. Nothing major, really. Just… old age, I guess. I was married, you know, but my husband… he's gone now. That was a long time ago, too.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Lilliana. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Regarding your health, you mentioned something with your heart years ago. Do you remember what that was, or perhaps have any records of it?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago. Let me think... it was something with my rhythm, I think. They said it wasn't serious, just to… be careful. I had some tests, and they gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them eventually. I don't really remember what the doctor said exactly. It was a long time ago, and I don't have good memory these days, you know? I don’t think I kept any records. It wasn’t anything… frightening, just… something to be aware of. I don’t even remember which doctor I saw. Everything is a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heart rhythm issue in the past, treated with medication, but details are fuzzy. We can try to get those records if you'd like, but it's not essential right now. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of! I eat everything, pretty much. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to help my mother in the garden, and I handled all sorts of plants, and I was fine. My skin is a bit sensitive sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I think. No, no allergies. Definitely not. I don't think so, anyway. It's hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure sometimes, when it gets high. My neighbor gives it to me, she used to be a nurse. It's… a little white pill. I don't know the name of it, I just take it when I feel a bit funny. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take… something for the pain, I think. It's an over-the-counter thing, you know, from the drugstore. I can't remember the name of that either. It’s just… to help me get through the day. I don’t take them every day, just when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a blood pressure pill occasionally from your neighbor, and an over-the-counter pain reliever for your knees as needed, but you don’t know the names of either. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we do a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, work is nice. I work at a daycare. I look after the little ones. It’s tiring, but I love it. Lots of playing, reading, and helping them with their… things. I'm on my feet a lot, you know? I get up and down, and I have to lift them sometimes. I walk to work, it’s not far, but it's a bit of a walk. At home, I mostly just… relax. Watch TV, read a bit, and talk to my neighbor. She's a good friend. I try to keep busy, but I get tired easily. I help with the cooking sometimes, but not too much. Mostly, I just take it easy. I like to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're on your feet a lot at work, lifting and playing with children, and walk to work. That’s good to know. Alright, Lilliana, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your joints and get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just… be gentle, alright? My joints aren’t what they used to be, you know? I don’t want to cause any trouble. Just… take your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. We'll take things slowly. First, could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Oh, that’s a bit high, isn’t it? But I manage. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Everything creaks these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Is that better, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s much better, thank you, Doctor. That’s a little easier. You’re very thoughtful. Now, what do you want me to do? Just tell me, and I’ll try my best. But please, be gentle. Everything feels a bit stiff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to gently feel around your hands and wrists. I'm looking for any swelling, warmth, or tenderness. Just relax your hands, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay, how does that feel on the back of your right hand?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. It’s a bit… tender. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It’s just… stiff, you know? Like someone’s been holding it too tight. And a bit achy. It feels… warmer than the other one, maybe? Is that normal? It’s just… a bit uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting that tenderness and warmth. And you're right, it does feel slightly warmer than your left hand. Now, let's check your left hand. How about this hand?
PATIENT: Hmm… this one’s not as bad. Still stiff, you know? But not as tender. Not as warm. Just… achy. Like I’ve been doing too much gardening. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. And it feels a bit… bumpy, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to tell. It’s just… a bit different than the other one.
DOCTOR: Okay, less tenderness and warmth on this side, and you noticed some bumps. I'm feeling those now. Now, I'm going to check your wrists. Can you bend your wrists up and down for me, gently?
PATIENT: Oh… Ooh, that’s a bit… uncomfortable. It’s stiff, you know? And it makes a bit of a… creaking sound. It doesn't hurt terribly, but it's not smooth. It feels… tight. Like someone’s got a rubber band around it. It’s just… not easy. Is that normal? Everything feels so… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: I hear that creaking sound, and I do feel a bit of stiffness. Okay, let's move on to your knees. Can you please bend your knees for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Ooh, that’s a bit… tricky. It’s stiff, you know? And it makes a… grinding sound. It doesn’t hurt terribly, but it's definitely not smooth. It feels… tight. Like someone’s got rusty hinges. It’s just… not easy. I can’t bend them very far, I’m afraid. Everything feels so… old, you know? I’m afraid I’ll get stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some stiffness and hear that grinding sound. There’s a bit of tenderness when I press here , and here . Now, can you try to stand up for me, slowly and carefully?
PATIENT: Oh… Ooh… that’s a bit… tricky. It’s stiff, you know? And it makes a… popping sound. It doesn’t hurt terribly, but it's definitely not smooth. It feels… wobbly. Like my legs are made of jelly. It’s just… not easy. I feel a bit… shaky, I’m afraid. Everything feels so… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That was helpful. Please, sit back down.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s much better. Everything feels so… tired, you know? It’s just… getting old, I suppose. What do you think is wrong? Is it something serious? I’m a bit worried, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana. Based on the exam, you have tenderness, warmth, and stiffness in your hands and wrists, and tenderness and a grinding sensation in your knees. The popping sound and wobbliness are also concerning. You're right to be concerned, but I don't think it's necessarily something serious in the immediate sense. It sounds very much like you may have osteoarthritis, which is a common condition, especially as we get older. It's caused by the breakdown of cartilage in your joints. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests and X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? I’ve heard of that. It’s… the wear and tear, isn’t it? Blood tests and X-rays… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. But… will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I don’t want to be a bother. And… what if it is something serious? I’m a bit scared, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It is the wear and tear, yes. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different type of arthritis. The X-rays will show us the condition of the cartilage in your joints. The blood test is just a simple draw of blood, and it shouldn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. The X-rays are painless, too – you'll just stand or sit while the machine takes pictures. As for what if it is something serious, that’s why we're doing these tests. But based on my exam, I don’t think it’s anything immediately dangerous. If it is osteoarthritis, it's manageable with treatment. We can discuss options like pain relievers, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and X-rays now. They should be able to schedule you quickly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… manageable. Pain relievers and physical therapy… I can try that. I don’t want to be a bother, you know? A referral… yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit… less scared now. But… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have much money, you know.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Lilliana. That's what I'm here for. The results usually take a few days to a week. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. I’ll write the referral to a facility that offers financial assistance programs. My nurse can also help you explore options for reducing the cost. We’ll do our best to make sure you get the care you need without a significant financial burden. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your pain, and using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, following the package directions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Financial assistance… that would be a great help. Ibuprofen… yes, I have some of that at home. I’ll try to avoid activities that aggravate my pain, too. Hmm… let me think. Will the physical therapy… help me with the little ones at work? I don’t want to lose my job, you know? It’s tiring, but I love it. And… will it get worse? Will I eventually… not be able to move at all? I’m a bit worried, you know. Everything feels so… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Lilliana. Let’s address them one by one. Physical therapy can absolutely help you with the little ones at work. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your joints and improve your range of motion, making it easier to lift, bend, and play with the children. They can also teach you techniques to protect your joints and prevent further injury. As for whether it will get worse, that depends on a number of factors, including how well you manage your symptoms and how closely you follow your treatment plan. It's not a guarantee that it will get worse, and with proper care, many people are able to maintain a good quality of life despite having arthritis. It's unlikely you'll eventually "not be able to move at all," especially with proactive treatment. We'll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. I'll also be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. A plan… yes, that sounds good. I like knowing there’s a plan. Hmm… no, I think that’s all for now. I'm a bit tired, you know? And a bit worried, but… less worried than before. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so kind. You've been very helpful. I think I’ll just… go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. Remember, we'll take things one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, before or after you get your test results. My nurse will give you the referral and some information about financial assistance programs. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. I’ll see you again once we have the test results. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It was lovely meeting you too. I think I’ll just… go home and rest now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. Take care, and have a good day. .
