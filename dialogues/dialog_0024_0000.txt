DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my legs, really. They just... gave out on me, practically. Not all at once, but after I got over a really nasty cold. It's quite inconvenient, you understand. I'm a tour guide, and you can't exactly give tours if you can barely walk.
DOCTOR: “Gave out,” you say. A rather imprecise description, but I suppose we can work with that. After a cold… hmm. And how long ago was this cold, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, don't patronize me, Doctor. I know it's not a precise medical term. It was… let me think. The cold itself ended about ten days ago, maybe a little more. It was a particularly lingering one, lots of coughing, you know. The weakness started a couple of days after I felt better from the cold. Not immediately, thankfully, or I'd have been stuck in bed the whole time.
DOCTOR: Ten days post-viral illness. And this weakness...can you describe it more specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. It’s more like… jelly. My legs just feel like jelly when I try to stand or walk for any length of time. They tremble, and I feel like I could just… topple over. It's in both legs, which is what’s so worrying. And it’s worse if I’ve been standing for a while. Sitting is fine, thankfully, but that’s hardly practical for my job, is it? I had to cancel a whole group last week. A very discerning group, I might add.
DOCTOR: “Jelly,” you say. An interesting choice of descriptor. And this trembling… is it constant, or intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely not constant, Doctor. Thank goodness. It comes and goes. When I first get up, or after sitting for a while, it’s much worse. I have to really concentrate to stand steady. Then, after I’ve been moving around for a bit, it seems to calm down. But if I push myself too hard, it comes back. Like yesterday, I tried to walk a bit further than I should have, and I almost needed a friend to help me back. Honestly, it’s rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I've been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But who isn't these days? It’s hard to say if that’s related. And my appetite hasn’t been quite the same, but again, it's been very hot, so that could easily be the weather. Nothing major, really. No numbness, no tingling, no shooting pains… just the legs feeling like they're about to collapse. Honestly, it's very frustrating. I’m normally so active.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some basics. Any relevant past medical history?
PATIENT: Relevant medical history? Honestly, not much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions. I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse, but that was years ago and healed perfectly. I’ve always been very healthy, very careful about what I eat and how much I exercise. That’s why this is so baffling. It just came out of nowhere. I don’t understand it at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had some trouble with her knees when she got older, arthritis, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. But that was quite a long time ago. No one else that I can recall with any leg problems, specifically. They were mostly heart issues, to be honest. My uncle had a bypass, my aunt had high blood pressure… the usual, I suppose. Nothing that would explain this. It feels like I'm getting nowhere with this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just a multivitamin. I believe in taking care of myself, as I said. Nothing for any specific condition. I don't like to load up on pills unless absolutely necessary. I find a good diet and exercise are usually enough. That’s why I'm so perplexed by all of this, Doctor. It’s just… not like me to be unwell. And certainly not like me to have wobbly legs!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick look at your legs, then. Just a basic neurological exam, to see what we’re dealing with. Please step up on the table.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. I suppose that’s sensible. It’s a bit high, isn’t it? And please, be gentle. I don’t want to make things worse. I'm rather concerned about falling.
DOCTOR: Reflexes appear normal bilaterally. Strength is… somewhat diminished, but not significantly. Can you point your toes?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels a bit… weak, doesn't it? And a little unsteady. I’m trying, Doctor, honestly. I don’t normally have trouble with this sort of thing. It's just… more difficult than usual. I can feel the wobble. It’s really quite annoying, actually. I used to be so graceful.
DOCTOR: Range of motion appears normal. Can you stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Slowly… yes. See? It's like jelly, Doctor. It just… gives way. I have to concentrate so hard not to fall. This is not normal, is it? It's really quite frightening, actually.
DOCTOR: No, it is not. Although, I suspect it's a functional weakness, likely post-viral. Let’s try a Romberg test. Close your eyes and stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Do not move.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… not good, Doctor. I'm losing my balance! This is exactly what I was afraid of. I can’t stand still. I’m going to fall! I can't do it, Doctor. It’s too dangerous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ve seen enough. It seems you have some balance issues, potentially exacerbated by the recent viral illness. I recommend a Vitamin D supplement, and careful attention to hydration. However, given your concerns, and the instability, I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Just to rule out anything more serious. I also recommend limiting your activity for the next week. Perhaps avoid leading tours for the time being.
PATIENT: Limiting my activity? Doctor, that’s hardly a solution! My livelihood depends on these tours! Vitamin D and hydration? I eat a perfectly balanced diet and drink plenty of water. I already do that! Is that really all you can suggest? Honestly, I came here expecting a proper diagnosis, not… vague advice. I feel like you're not taking my concerns seriously. This isn’t just a little weakness, it's impacting my life! I need to know what’s wrong with my legs, not be told to take a vitamin. What exactly will these blood tests tell us? And how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I assure you I am taking your concerns seriously. However, sometimes the body simply requires time to recover. These blood tests will rule out any underlying deficiencies or inflammatory processes. It's standard procedure. The results should be back within three to five business days. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity. If the weakness worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms such as numbness or shooting pains, I advise you to seek immediate medical attention. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Three to five business days? That’s an eternity when you're self-employed! And "significant worsening"? What constitutes significant? You're being deliberately vague, Doctor. I find it rather insulting. Fine. I’ll get the blood tests. But I expect a proper explanation when the results come back. And frankly, I expect more than just vague suggestions about vitamins. If this doesn’t improve, I’m seeking a second opinion. Where do I go to schedule the blood work?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 102. They have a list of covered tests from my office. Just present your insurance card and the requisition form, and they’ll take care of everything. If you have any further questions, my nurse can assist you. Now, if that is all, I have other patients to attend to.
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll go. Honestly, the lack of attention… I’ve had better service at a roadside diner.
