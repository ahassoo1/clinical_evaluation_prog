DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Sieh. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is a little… embarrassing, to be honest. I have been having a lot of… gas. More than usual. It is quite disruptive, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all – digestive issues are very common, and we can certainly look into what’s causing yours. “Disruptive” is a good way to put it, I suppose. When did you first start noticing this increase in gas?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began, oh, approximately three weeks ago, I believe. July 10th, if my calculations are correct. It was not sudden, but gradual. A little bit more each day. At first, I thought it was something I ate, but it has continued even with changes to my diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three weeks, starting around July 10th, and it hasn't improved with dietary changes. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the gas for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it is… normal gas, I suppose. Not painful, exactly. More… uncomfortable. It builds up, and then… it happens. Sometimes it is quiet, sometimes… not so quiet. It is the frequency that is the problem, not the… sound, usually. And it smells… like normal food, I think. Nothing… unusual. I apologize for being so detailed.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all. Details are very important! It helps me understand what’s going on. So, it's not associated with pain, and the odor is normal. It's the increased frequency that's concerning you. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the gas. No pain in my stomach, no… changes in my bowel movements, nothing like that. I eat normally, I sleep normally, I feel… well, except for this. I have been a little bit more tired lately, but I thought that was just the summer heat. It has been very warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other digestive symptoms, and just a little bit of increased fatigue that you're attributing to the heat. That’s good to know. Let's talk a little bit about your diet. You said you've made changes, but can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Usually, for breakfast, I have a slice of toast with a little bit of jam, and a cup of tea. For lunch, it is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, or sometimes turkey. And for dinner… well, it varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes a small portion of chicken with vegetables. I do enjoy potatoes, when I have them. I try to eat healthy, I really do. I do not drink soda, and only a little bit of coffee. Perhaps too many potatoes?
DOCTOR: Potatoes are delicious, and it’s unlikely they’re the sole cause. It’s good that you have a fairly balanced diet and don't drink soda. Do you eat a lot of beans, broccoli, cabbage, or onions?
PATIENT: Beans, not particularly. Perhaps once a month. Broccoli, sometimes, but not a large amount. Cabbage… very rarely. And onions, yes, I do use onions when I cook. Not a huge amount, but I do enjoy them in my soup. Now that you mention it, I did have a rather large bowl of onion soup last week. Could that have contributed?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Onions can definitely contribute to gas production. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any previous digestive issues – things like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always had a… normal stomach, I suppose. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, but that was many years ago and caused no lasting issues. I do have slightly high blood pressure, and I take medication for that, but that is all. And I receive Medicare, as I am getting older, of course. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Good to know about the appendix removal and the high blood pressure. The medication is relevant, as some medications can affect digestion. And your Medicare coverage is noted. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. I have been taking it for approximately five years now, as prescribed by my previous doctor. I did not realize that it could affect my stomach. Is that common?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril can sometimes cause digestive side effects, including diarrhea and nausea. While gas isn’t a common side effect, it’s certainly possible. Let's move on to family history. Are there any digestive issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had some… stomach troubles when she was older, but I do not recall the specifics. She went to many doctors, but never spoke much about it. My father, no. He always had a very strong stomach. He could eat anything! I believe he had a fondness for sausages. And my sister, no. She is very healthy, thankfully. It was mostly my mother, I believe, and that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly your mother, and that was some time ago. And now, just to finish up, let’s talk about social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. I find it quite unpleasant, actually. I do enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally, but only one glass. And I do not drink very often – perhaps two or three times a week. I am not much of a drinker, to be honest. I prefer tea.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no smoking, occasional wine, and you prefer tea. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for that thorough history. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like the gas could be related to the Lisinopril, or possibly triggered by something you ate, like the onion soup. However, it's always best to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I trust your judgement. Listening to my abdomen… yes, that is fine. I have no objections at all. Please, proceed when you are ready. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know. It is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I'll need to lift your shirt a bit, just so I can listen properly. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Okay. I’m listening now. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. I do hear some increased bowel sounds – they're a bit louder and more frequent than normal. There's no sign of distension or masses. The increased bowel sounds support the idea of some increased gas activity.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It is… a bit cold, perhaps? No, it is fine. I am happy you did not find anything concerning. Increased bowel sounds… yes, that makes sense, I suppose. It does feel rather… rumbling inside, sometimes. So, what does this mean, Doctor? What do we do now?
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on everything you've told me, and the physical exam findings, it’s most likely that this is functional gas, possibly exacerbated by the Lisinopril or something you ate. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. I’d like to start with a trial of dietary adjustments and see if that helps. I recommend avoiding common gas-producing foods for a week or two: things like beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, carbonated drinks, and artificial sweeteners. You can also try over-the-counter simethicone, which helps break up gas bubbles. If the symptoms don’t improve after two weeks, or if they worsen, we can consider a trial off the Lisinopril – but we’d want to discuss that with your primary care physician first, as it’s important to manage your blood pressure. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Avoiding those foods… yes, I can certainly do that. And the simethicone… I have seen advertisements for that. I will try it. A trial off the Lisinopril… yes, that makes sense as well. Speaking with my doctor… yes, absolutely. It is a relief to hear that it is not something serious. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. So, no special tests? No… unpleasant procedures?
DOCTOR: No, based on your history and the exam, I don't think any special tests or procedures are necessary at this time. We’re starting with the simplest approaches first. If the symptoms persist despite these measures, then we can consider further investigation, but I don't think that’s necessary right now. I’ll give you a printout with a list of gas-producing foods to avoid, and information on simethicone. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe so. You have answered all of my questions, and explained everything very clearly. A printout… yes, that is very helpful. I am very grateful for your time and attention, Doctor Sieh. You have put my mind at ease. I shall follow your instructions carefully. Thank you again. Perhaps I will see you again, but hopefully not for this!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. And hopefully, you won't need to see me again for this! If the symptoms do worsen or don't improve after a couple of weeks, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's that printout. Take care, and have a good day. .
