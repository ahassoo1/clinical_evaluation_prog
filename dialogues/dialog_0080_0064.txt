DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… it’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you know? More like… a squeezing. It started maybe… three days ago? I think it was after I was carrying some boxes for my daughter. She moved some furniture, and she asked me to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing chest pain that started about three days ago, possibly after helping your daughter move furniture. That’s good information. Can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… someone is hugging my chest very, very tight. And it goes into my arm sometimes, the left one. Not always, though. It happens when I walk, mostly. If I stop and rest, it gets better. It’s not so bad when I’m sitting, or lying down. Does that make sense? I don't know all the words for this, you see.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sherion. You're describing it very well. A tight squeezing sensation in your chest that radiates to your left arm, brought on by walking, and relieved by rest… That’s important information. How long does the pain typically last when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… not long. Maybe… five minutes? Ten, sometimes. It doesn't stay for a long time, thank goodness. It comes and goes, like waves. And it's not always there when I walk, you know? Some walks are okay, some aren't. It's… unpredictable. I don’t want to cause trouble, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something serious. My husband, he worries a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, and it's smart to listen to your husband's concerns. Okay, so the pain is intermittent, lasting up to ten minutes, and triggered by exertion. Let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get a little bit breathless sometimes, when I'm walking up the stairs. Not every time, but a few times lately. And I feel a little tired, more tired than usual. But I am 62, you know? Maybe that's just getting old! Oh, and sometimes my jaw feels a little… achy. Not a bad ache, just… uncomfortable. It's hard to explain, it's not like a toothache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath with exertion, increased fatigue, and a mild jaw discomfort. Those are all things we need to consider. Now, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… My doctor told me a few years ago I have high blood pressure. I take a pill for it, every morning. The little white one. And… I think he said my cholesterol was a little high too, but it hasn't been so bad lately. He checks it every year. No diabetes, though. And… no heart problems, not that I know of. My husband always says I worry too much, so maybe that's why I'm here!
DOCTOR: It's good you're proactive about your health, and that you're consistent with your medication. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I just know it’s the little white one! My daughter is the one who fills it for me usually, she is very organized. I think… it starts with an 'A'? Am-loh-dipine? Is that right? I'm so sorry, I really don’t remember the names. I just take it every morning with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Sherion. Amlodipine is correct, and that’s perfectly fine. Many people don't remember medication names. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital when I had my daughter, of course. That was a very happy time! Other than that… no, I don’t think so. No other surgeries, no other hospital stays. I've been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and delivery of your daughter. Good to know. What about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. My father... he had a heart attack when he was older. And my mother, she had high blood pressure, just like me. And her sister, my aunt, she had a stroke. So, lots of problems on that side of the family, I think. My husband's family was healthier, I think. He doesn't remember much about their medical history, though. He wasn't very close to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart attack in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and stroke in your aunt. That's helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of! I eat everything, I like to cook, you know? My husband, he’s a little fussy, but I can eat anything. No problems with any medicines either, I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, Sherion, thank you for all this information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I'm a little worried, but I know you’ll do your best.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I hope I’m not making too much trouble for you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you see.
DOCTOR: You're not making any trouble at all, Sherion. It's my job to figure out what's going on and to help you feel better. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily concerning, but we'll keep it in mind. Your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. It’s not drastically high, but it’s a bit higher than your usual. I don't feel any significant tenderness when I press on your chest. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. Just… a little worried, you know? About the murmur and the blood pressure. My doctor always says I worry too much! What does the murmur mean, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sherion. A murmur simply means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. It can be perfectly normal, especially with age, or it could indicate a minor valve issue. We need to investigate a little further to determine the cause. Your pulses are good and equal in both arms and ankles. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, just to make sure everything sounds normal there. Your abdomen sounds normal as well. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Your symptoms – the squeezing chest pain brought on by exertion, radiating to your left arm, the shortness of breath and fatigue – are consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure and murmur are also things we need to address. It’s also important to rule out other potential causes of chest pain.
PATIENT: Angina… that sounds scary, Doctor. Is that… serious? What does that mean for me? Will I have to have surgery? My husband… he’s going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: It's natural to be worried when you hear that word, Sherion. Angina itself isn’t a heart attack, but it is a warning sign that your heart isn't getting enough oxygen. It needs to be taken seriously. Whether or not you’ll need surgery depends on what we find during further testing. We need to determine the extent of the blockage in your arteries. I want to order a few tests. First, an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Then, a blood test to check for cardiac enzymes, which can indicate heart damage. And finally, I’d like to schedule a stress test, where we monitor your heart while you exercise on a treadmill. This will help us see how your heart responds to exertion. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A stress test… on a treadmill? Oh dear. I haven't been on a treadmill in years! What if… what if my heart can’t handle it? The tests… are they expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don’t want to cause too much trouble for the insurance. And… how long will it take to get the results? My daughter is coming to visit next week, and I don’t want to worry her.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be anxious about the stress test, Sherion. You won't be running a marathon! The treadmill is used at a very controlled pace, and we'll monitor your heart closely throughout the test. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. As for the costs, Medicare typically covers these tests, but we'll double-check your coverage to be sure. Our billing department can assist you with any questions you have about your out-of-pocket expenses. The results from the EKG and blood tests should be available within a few days. The stress test usually takes a bit longer, about a week or so. We’ll schedule it as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I told you that already, remember? But… what if I do have to have surgery? What kind of surgery is it? Is it… dangerous? And how long would I be in the hospital? My husband… he wouldn't know what to do without me.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Sherion, and I apologize for not being clearer earlier. It's important you have all the information. Let's focus on getting the test results first. If the tests show significant blockage, the most common procedure is either angioplasty with stenting or bypass surgery. Angioplasty involves inserting a small balloon into the blocked artery to open it up, and then placing a stent to keep it open. Bypass surgery involves creating a new pathway for blood flow around the blocked artery. Both procedures have risks, as with any surgery, but they are generally very safe and effective. We would discuss all the risks and benefits in detail if it comes to that. The length of your hospital stay would depend on the type of surgery, but it would typically be several days to a week. We have excellent cardiac rehabilitation programs available to help you recover. For now, let’s get these tests done, and we'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. I’m just… very worried. It’s a lot to take in. Can I call you if I think of anything else? And… who should I tell? My daughter, maybe?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. You can call me anytime – my number is on the paper I gave you. And yes, telling your daughter would be a good idea. Having support during this time is very important. I’m going to write up an order for the tests now. The nurse will come in to explain the details and schedule them for you. In the meantime, try to relax and take things easy. We'll get through this together. And remember, we don’t even know yet if you need any surgery. Let’s focus on getting the information first. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: You're not trouble at all, Sherion. It’s my job to help you, and I'm here for you every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to explain the next steps. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Take care, Sherion. And remember, we'll get through this together.
