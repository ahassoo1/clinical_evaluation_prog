DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it's this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. It doesn’t… go away. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ back there, you know? I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. A while. Yes, a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-standing dry cough. I understand. It is good you’re getting it checked out. And you said you don't recall exactly when it started, just that it’s been a while. Can you tell me anything about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It… wasn’t in the summer, I don’t think. Maybe… fall? No, winter, maybe. With the cold. I used to… work in the garage, you see. Lots of dust and… fumes. Could be from that, I suppose. It’s hard to say. My mind… isn’t what it used to be. I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s like… little bits are missin’.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovec. Don't apologize at all. It's very common for memories to be a bit fuzzy as we get older. The garage work is helpful information, though. So, the cough seemed to start around winter, possibly linked to the dust and fumes from working in the garage. Has anything specific made it worse since then?
PATIENT: Worse… well, when it's cold, definitely worse. And… when I lay down flat. That always gets it goin’. Makes me… sit up a lot at night. My wife… she used to help me. But… she’s gone now. It just feels… older now, the cough. Not new. It’s been a steady friend, in a bad way.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovec. That must be very difficult. And thank you for sharing that. A cough that's worse with cold temperatures and when lying down is helpful to know. Has the cough changed at all over time—has it become more frequent, more intense, or have you noticed anything different about it recently?
PATIENT: Different… no, not really. Still dry. Sometimes… it’s a little… rattly, maybe? But mostly just dry. No… phlegm or anything. It doesn’t keep me from… eatin’ or anything. Just… annoying. And tires me out. Makes me… breathin’ harder. It’s just a… constant thing, you know? Like a little… shadow. Always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant dry cough, occasionally a little rattly, without any phlegm, not impacting your eating, but causing some fatigue and shortness of breath. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I remember. No chills… no night sweats. I haven't… felt hot or cold, really. Just… tired. And… a little weak, sometimes. Mostly just… old. I haven't been feelin’ too strong lately, but I figure that’s just… age. I don’t know. It's hard to say what’s from the cough and what’s just… bein’ ninety.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovec. It can be hard to separate what's cough-related and what's simply a part of getting older. Now, have you noticed any chest pain, wheezing, or shortness of breath at rest, meaning when you aren’t active?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really pain. Sometimes a… tightness. Like a band around my chest. And the breathin’… gets short just… walkin’ to the bathroom, sometimes. Not when I’m layin’ down, mostly when I try to… do somethin’. Not awful, just… noticeable. Wheezin’? I don’t think so. Just… harder to get air. I used to… be strong, you know? Workin’ on cars all day. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some chest tightness and shortness of breath with exertion, not at rest, and no wheezing. That’s helpful. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you had any recent weight loss, loss of appetite, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Weight loss… maybe? I haven't been… weighin' myself. My wife… she used to do that. Appetite… not much changed, I eat what I can. Bowel habits… same as always, I suppose. Everything’s… slowin’ down, that’s for sure. But I don’t think anything’s changed changed, you know? It's just… old age. Everything’s a little… quieter.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovec. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. My wife gave me medicine when I was sick, and I never had a problem. I don’t remember ever bein’ allergic to anything. Dust, maybe, from the garage. But not… a medicine allergy. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t taken much medicine in years, really. Just what the wife gave me when I had a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And currently, are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Not a thing. Stopped takin' the blood pressure pills a long time ago. The wife… she handled all that. Since she’s gone… I just haven’t bothered. Didn't seem important. Just… quiet. Everything's just quiet now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovec. Thank you. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation if you don't mind. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… fine. Whatever you think best. I haven't had anyone listen to my chest in… a long time. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still. Just let me know if you need me to… do somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovec. I listened to your lungs and heart. I heard some scattered rhonchi, which are essentially little crackling sounds, primarily at the base of your lungs. Your heart sounds are a bit quiet, but regular. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve heard, it sounds like you may have some underlying chronic bronchitis, potentially aggravated by your history of working in the garage. It’s also possible there’s a bit of pneumonia brewing, although your symptoms aren’t classic for that. To be sure, I'd like to get a chest X-ray. Would you be willing to go down to radiology to get one?
PATIENT: X-ray… hmm. Is it… safe? I don’t like… machines much. Used to fix ‘em, but… bein’ in ‘em… feels different. And… will it cost much? I don’t have much money, you see. My wife… she handled all the finances. I’m just… quiet now. It’s a lot to ask. Pneumonia? That sounds… bad. What will happen if I… don't get it done?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Pavlovec, and I understand your concerns. X-rays use a very small amount of radiation and the risk is extremely low, especially for a single test. It’s much safer to know what’s going on in your lungs. As for cost, I’ll have the billing department look into options for you. We can see if there are any assistance programs available, given your insurance status. If we don't get an X-ray, we won't know for sure what’s causing your cough and shortness of breath. It could be something minor, but it could also be something more serious, like pneumonia. If it is pneumonia, and we don't treat it, it can become very dangerous, especially for someone your age. Would you like me to have someone from the billing department come and speak with you about the costs and potential assistance programs?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. You're right. Best to know, I suppose. Pneumonia sounds… nasty. My wife… she always said to get things checked. Yes, please. Have someone come and talk to me about the money. And… the X-ray. Just… tell me what I have to do. I'm not as spry as I used to be. Just… quiet. Everything's just quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovec. I’ll have someone from billing come speak with you shortly. For the X-ray, you’ll simply go down to the radiology department, which is just down the hall and to the left. They will have you change into a gown, and a technician will take a few pictures of your chest. It doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll stand or lie on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. While we’re waiting for billing and scheduling the X-ray, I’m going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. This will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a common medication, and it can provide some relief while we figure out what's going on. Do you have any questions about the inhaler?
PATIENT: Inhaler… alright. How do I… use it? I haven’t used one of those… since my wife… she showed me, years ago. I always forget. And… is it expensive? Everything seems expensive these days. My mind… it doesn’t hold things like it used to. I need someone to show me, I think. A slow, slow show. Just… quiet. Everything is just quiet.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovec. Don’t worry about forgetting; that's perfectly normal. The nurse will come in and give you a demonstration on how to use the inhaler before you leave today. She'll make sure you're comfortable with it. It’s a very simple process, but it’s best to have someone show you. As for the cost, I will write a prescription for the generic version, which is much cheaper. I will also ask the billing department to check if there are any programs to help cover the cost. Let me write that prescription for you now. And I’ll let the nurse know to come and give you a demonstration on the inhaler shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient. It’s just… a lot to take in. Everything is just… quiet now. I’ll just sit here, I suppose, and wait for the nurse. And… the money people. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovec. You just sit and relax, and I’ll let the nurse know to come in as soon as possible. Take a deep breath. We’ll figure this out. I will check on you again in a few minutes. Please don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all. .
PATIENT: .
