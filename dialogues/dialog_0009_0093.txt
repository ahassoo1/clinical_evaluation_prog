DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, honestly, it's… well, things just aren't right. Been feeling a bit off, you know? Sleep’s been terrible, and I don't have the energy I used to. My wife… she always kept me on a schedule, made sure I was eating right, exercising. It’s been a while since she passed, and everything’s just… slipped. I think that’s what it is. Just need a little… nudge, maybe, to get back on track. Not sure where to even start, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for routines to be disrupted and for your health to take a backseat during times of grief. It takes a lot of strength just to come in and address these things, so thank you for doing that. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and sleep disturbance, possibly related to the changes you've been going through. To help me get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how long you've been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. Long? Honestly… it's been a blur. Probably… since not long after… well, you know. Six months? Maybe eight? Time kinda… loses meaning. It’s not like I’ve been keeping a diary or anything. I just know I used to wake up feeling… capable. Now I just feel… drained. And I toss and turn all night. Not really nightmares, just… restless. Doesn’t feel good, you know? It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright that you haven't been keeping track – grief doesn’t lend itself to schedules. Six to eight months is a significant amount of time, and it's good you're addressing this now. The fatigue and restless sleep are definitely things we should explore. When you say you feel drained, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's just… everything takes effort. Even getting out of bed. I used to be able to work all day in the shop, fixing instruments, tuning pianos… didn’t even think about it. Now? I get maybe a few hours in, then I need to lie down. And it’s not like I’m physically sore, just… empty. Like the battery’s flat. I used to enjoy playing the oud, too, but even that feels… pointless now. It's not a pain, you understand? Just… no drive.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating, Chanz. The loss of motivation and enjoyment in things you used to love is a significant symptom. It’s good you're able to articulate that so clearly. The feeling of being “empty” and lacking drive is important information. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight since your wife passed?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I remember to, I suppose. Mostly just… simple things. Sandwiches, soup. Not much cooking going on. Weight… probably lost a bit. Clothes feel a little looser, but honestly, I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. It's not like I'm starving myself or anything, just… not much of an appetite for anything interesting. My wife always made such lovely meals… everything was always so… vibrant. Now it’s just… fuel, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a decrease in appetite, eating simpler meals, and some unintentional weight loss. Thank you for sharing that, Chanz. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, outside of the fatigue, sleep issues, and changes in appetite, have you experienced any other symptoms – things like headaches, digestive problems, feeling anxious or sad, or difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Concentration… that's getting worse, yeah. I used to be able to focus on a repair for hours, really get into it. Now I find myself… drifting off, having to re-read instructions, forgetting where I put my tools. It’s… irritating. And… I wouldn’t say anxious, exactly. More… detached. Like watching a movie of my own life, you know? Sadness comes and goes, mostly when I think about… well, you know. But it's not constant. I get more… frustrated, I think. Frustrated with myself for not being… useful.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful way to describe it, Chanz – feeling detached and watching a movie of your own life. The frustration with yourself is also important. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of symptoms – fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a sense of detachment. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmm. Not much to tell, honestly. I’ve always been… pretty healthy. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I go to the dentist, get a check-up when I remember. Medicare covers the basics, I suppose. My wife… she was the one who kept track of all that. I really couldn’t tell you what’s been done recently, or what I should be looking out for.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a relatively healthy medical history with routine dental care. That's good to know. And you mentioned Medicare covers the basics. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Occasionally an aspirin for a headache, but that’s it. My wife used to give me something for my back, but I haven’t bothered with that since… well, since. I don't really believe in taking pills unless I absolutely have to. She liked her vitamins, though. All sorts of things. I never really got into that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Let me think. My father had a bad heart, died pretty young, actually. Maybe in his sixties. And my mother… she suffered from… I don’t know what you’d call it. Just… sadness. A lot of sadness. Spent a lot of time in bed. Never really talked about it. My wife's side of the family… mostly healthy, as far as I know. A bit of arthritis, I think. Nothing major. They weren't really ones for talking about illnesses either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease on your father’s side and a history of sadness on your mother’s side. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history – things like your occupation, whether you smoke or drink alcohol, and if you have any hobbies or support systems?
PATIENT: Right. Occupation, as you know, is musical instrument repair. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Always liked working with my hands. Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Occasionally a glass of wine with dinner, when my wife was still around. Haven’t really bothered with it since. Hobbies… used to play the oud, as I said. Now… not so much. Support system? Not really. I have a few acquaintances from the shop, but… it’s mostly just work talk. It’s… lonely, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chanz. That gives me a much clearer picture of your situation. It sounds like you've experienced a significant loss, and you're dealing with a combination of grief, fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a sense of loneliness. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. Honestly, I’m not expecting much. I just… hope you can figure out something. I just want to feel… normal again, I suppose. Or, you know, as close to normal as I’m going to get.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. That's a perfectly reasonable hope, and we'll do our best to figure things out together. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70, which isn't concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is normal at 98.6, and your respiration is also within the normal range. Your heart sounds are normal, and I don't hear any unusual sounds in your lungs. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or unusual sounds. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Your ears, nose and throat are clear. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious abnormalities. However, given your symptoms and the duration of your illness, I think it's important to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Blood tests, fine. Anything that might help. Honestly, I’m just… trusting you to figure out what’s going on. I don't really understand all that medical stuff. Just… tell me what you need, and I'll do it. I just want to feel… something again.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Chanz. I completely understand that medical jargon can be confusing, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. These tests will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to draw the blood for you. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I also want to talk about your grief. Losing your wife is a deeply traumatic experience, and it’s common to experience a wide range of emotions and symptoms. Have you considered seeking any grief counseling or support groups?
PATIENT: Grief counseling… No. My wife… she would have wanted me to just… get on with it. She was always very practical. I tried reading a few books, but… it just didn’t help. Everything just felt… trite. Like they didn’t understand. And honestly, I don’t really want to talk about it with strangers. It feels… disrespectful, somehow. She’s not here to share it with.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chanz. It's perfectly valid to feel that way. Grief is a very personal experience, and there's no right or wrong way to process it. It sounds like you’re someone who prefers to cope independently, and that’s perfectly alright. However, sometimes talking to a professional can provide a safe space to explore your emotions and develop coping strategies. If you ever change your mind, there are resources available, and I can provide you with some information. In the meantime, let’s focus on addressing your physical symptoms. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend focusing on establishing a regular routine, even if it’s just a few small steps. Things like getting up at the same time each day, eating regular meals, and getting some gentle exercise can make a big difference. It sounds like you used to enjoy playing the oud. Perhaps starting to play again, even for a few minutes each day, could be helpful.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Routine… I suppose. That's what she would have wanted too. Get up, eat… try not to just… exist. The oud… maybe. It feels… wrong, playing without her. She always loved to listen. But… I suppose it's better than nothing. Gentle exercise… I used to walk a lot with her. Maybe I could start doing that again. Small steps. That sounds… manageable.
DOCTOR: That’s a great attitude, Chanz. Small steps are often the most effective. And you're right, it’s perfectly understandable that playing the oud feels wrong without your wife. But perhaps doing it in her memory could be a way to honor her and reconnect with something you both enjoyed. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I also want to rule out any potential medication interactions. You mentioned you occasionally take aspirin for headaches. Are you taking any other over-the-counter medications or supplements, even vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just the aspirin, and rarely. I think I took one a couple of weeks ago, maybe. Honestly, I barely even remember. I don't really like taking pills, as I said. My wife… she was the one who kept track of all that stuff. I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. It’s easy to lose track of things, especially during times of stress. And it’s perfectly alright to not have all the answers. Okay, so just the occasional aspirin. That’s helpful to know. The lab results should be back in a couple of days. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… alright. Just… thank you. For listening, I mean. And for not… dismissing me. It feels like a long time since anyone really listened. Just… try not to tell me to get grief counseling, okay? I think I can handle it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. It’s my pleasure. I understand completely, and I promise I won’t push grief counseling. My goal is to help you feel better, and that starts with listening to your needs and concerns. Please do take care of yourself, and remember to be kind to yourself during this difficult time. I’ll be in touch soon with the lab results. It was nice meeting you, Chanz.
PATIENT: Yeah, you too. Thanks again.
