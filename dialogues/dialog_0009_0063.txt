DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it really hurts. Bad. Been hurting for a little while now, but it's gotten worse the last few weeks. I think it’s because of the… the cancer. I had some treatment, but it still hurts. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like you're experiencing significant back pain, and understandably, you're concerned it might be related to your previous cancer treatment. It's good you’re bringing this up. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain all the time. Sometimes it’s just… dull, like a heavy ache. And other times… other times it feels like someone is stabbing me. It’s mostly in my lower back, right here. <gestures to lower back> It gets worse when I try to stand up, or bend over. Sitting for too long isn’t good either. Makes it really stiff. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of different types of pain – a dull ache, and sharp, stabbing sensations, which is not uncommon. And it’s helpful to know it’s localized to your lower back, and worsened by specific movements like standing, bending, and prolonged sitting. Can you tell me a bit about the cancer treatment you received?
PATIENT: Okay. I had… chemotherapy. A long time ago, maybe… five years now? And then some radiation. They did it right… around here. <points to general abdomen area> It was at the big hospital in town. They said it was… stage two, I think. Something like that. I don’t remember all the details, it was a hard time. I haven’t had any treatment since then, just check-ups. They always asked if I was hurting, but this… this is different. It feels… worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Meigs. Five years post-treatment is certainly a reasonable timeframe for potential late effects or new issues to arise. Stage two is helpful to know. And it's completely understandable that you wouldn’t remember all the details after a difficult experience like chemotherapy and radiation. To get a clearer picture, let's talk about your past medical history a little more broadly. Aside from the cancer, have you had any other significant medical conditions, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Before the cancer? Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. I’ve always been pretty healthy, even with the back hurting sometimes. Just… regular check-ups. Doctor always said I was strong. That was before all this, of course. <gestures vaguely to her body> Is that helpful? I get confused easily, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Meigs, thank you. Tonsillectomy and a broken arm are good to know, but it sounds like you were generally healthy before the cancer diagnosis. No other major medical issues – that's good information. And please, don’t apologize for being confused. It’s perfectly normal, and I'm happy to take things at your pace. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… arthritis, I think? Bad arthritis in her hands and knees. She was always complaining about the pain. And my uncle, he had… diabetes. He had to take shots all the time. That’s about all I know. Nobody else really had much… trouble. They all lived to be pretty old. Does arthritis and diabetes matter? I don't know if that has anything to do with my back.
DOCTOR: Yes, that information is helpful, Ms. Meigs. Arthritis and diabetes can sometimes be relevant, so thank you for sharing that. Both conditions can have systemic effects and it's good to be aware of a family history of them. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I work at the factory, doing… packing. Lots of standing and bending, not very good for my back now. I live alone, in an apartment. I try to walk sometimes, but it's hard when my back hurts. I like to garden, when I can. It makes me happy. I don’t smoke or drink. And I try to eat healthy, but it’s not always easy. I cook for myself mostly. Nothing fancy. Is there something special you want to know?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like your work involves physical activity that might be contributing to your back pain, which is something we should consider. Living alone, and your efforts to stay active with walking and gardening are positive. And thank you for letting me know you don't smoke or drink and try to eat healthy. Now, I'm going to ask about any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D pill every day, the doctor told me to. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And sometimes, when my back really hurts, I take… ibuprofen. The regular kind, you can buy at the store. That helps a little. Other than that… nothing. I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. <pauses> I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen are helpful to know. And good to hear you don't have any known allergies. The previous blood pressure medication is good information to have, but since you're no longer taking it, it’s less of a concern at the moment. Okay, now I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your back, and we’ll do a quick neurological exam just to see how your nerves are functioning. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. <she shifts slightly in her chair> It hurts a little when they touch it, though. I’m warning you. Just be gentle, okay? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will be very gentle. And I appreciate you letting me know it’s tender. I will proceed cautiously. Okay, Ms. Meigs, I'm noting some muscle spasm on both sides of your lower back, but more pronounced on the right side. Palpation does elicit tenderness, as you mentioned, especially around the L4-L5 vertebral level. No visible swelling or redness. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… hard. It stops hurting pretty quickly, right here. <points to the middle of her lower back> I can’t go much further, it’s too painful. I feel a little dizzy now, sorry. Is that okay? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, that’s perfectly alright. Please stop when you feel pain, and it’s good you told me about feeling dizzy. We will stop for now. The dizziness is something we should keep in mind. I'm also going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs, just to make sure there's no nerve compression. I'll lightly tap your knees with this little hammer, and you just let your legs relax. This will test your reflexes. Your reflexes are good, equal on both sides. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab to check your sensation. Please tell me when you feel it. Your sensation is also good. Okay, Ms. Meigs, based on the exam, I’m noting muscle spasm, tenderness to palpation in your lower back, and limited range of motion. Your reflexes and sensation are intact, which is reassuring. This suggests a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or sprain of the muscles in your lower back. However, given your history of cancer and radiation treatment, we need to consider other possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… complicated. What does that mean? Is it… the cancer coming back? I’m scared, Doctor. <she fidgets with her hands> It’s been so long, I thought I was okay. Is it serious? What are we going to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, and it’s completely natural to be scared, especially given your history. It’s good that you’re sharing your fears with me. Let's address your concerns directly. While the possibility of the cancer returning is always a consideration, your symptoms—muscle spasm, tenderness, and limited range of motion—are more typical of a mechanical back problem. However, we can’t rule out other causes without further investigation. The radiation therapy could have caused some changes to the tissues in your back, which might be contributing to your pain. And sometimes, pain from other sources can mimic cancer-related pain. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back. This will help us visualize your bones and rule out any fractures or other structural problems. I'm also going to order blood work, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers, to look for signs of infection or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I want to know what’s happening. I just want to feel better. X-rays and blood work, okay. Can they… find it if the cancer came back? And will it hurt to get the X-rays? I get nervous, you know? Especially about hospitals. It brings back bad memories. I’m really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Meigs, and I want to reassure you that we will do everything we can to make you comfortable. The X-ray will primarily help us rule out fractures or other bone abnormalities. It’s not the most sensitive test for detecting cancer recurrence, but it will give us a good starting point. If the X-ray shows anything concerning, we may need to consider further imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan, which are more sensitive for detecting soft tissue abnormalities. Getting an X-ray itself is painless. You’ll simply stand or lie on a table while the machine takes a picture of your back. The radiation exposure is minimal. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and explain everything step-by-step. And I absolutely understand your anxiety about hospitals. We can talk about coping strategies if you’re feeling overwhelmed. We'll make sure you're not alone during the procedure, and I will be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they are available. Let's start with the X-ray and blood work. I’ll write the orders now. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s okay. Just… hurry, please? I don’t want to wait too long. And can I call my daughter after? She worries about me. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. <she looks down at her hands, taking a deep breath>
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will expedite the orders, and we’ll get the process moving as quickly as possible. The lab and radiology departments are aware of my clinic, so they prioritize our patients. You absolutely can call your daughter after, and I encourage you to. Staying connected with loved ones is important. I will have the nurse come in to draw your blood and give you instructions for scheduling your X-ray. I'll also print out some information about back pain management techniques you can try in the meantime. We'll get this sorted out, Ms. Meigs. I will be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns before I ask the nurse to come in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. <she manages a small, hesitant smile> I appreciate you listening to me. It helps to… talk about it. Really helps. Now… I guess I just wait. <she looks around the room nervously> Is there water? My mouth is dry.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad that talking about it helps, and that's what I'm here for. And yes, absolutely, let me get you some water. Here you go. Please take your time, and let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you while you wait. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very gentle and will explain everything clearly. We'll get these tests done and I'll review the results as soon as they come in. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. <she takes a sip of water, looking more relaxed> You’ve been very kind. I’m just… worried. But I feel a little better now, knowing you’re here to help. Okay. I’ll wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could ease your worries, even a little. Please don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any new concerns. I will be right nearby, and the nurse will be in shortly. .
