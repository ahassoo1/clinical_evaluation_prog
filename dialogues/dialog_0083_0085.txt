DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re 31 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning. It’s about this… discoloration on my skin. It’s really quite bothersome, and frankly, I’m surprised it’s taken this long to come to anything. It just looks wrong, you know? It’s not… symmetrical.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Discoloration that isn’t symmetrical is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me more about this discoloration?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, I’d say about six months ago, maybe a little more. It's on my left forearm, mostly. It's not raised, thankfully, it’s just… different. A bit darker than the rest of my skin. I keep comparing it to my right arm, and it’s just… off. I moisturize religiously, so it’s not from dryness or anything like that. I really don’t understand what would cause it, and it’s quite distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, mostly on the left forearm, not raised, and you haven’t noticed any changes with moisturizing. That’s helpful. Has the discoloration been changing in size, shape, or color since it started?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. Very slowly, mind you. It’s not like it doubled overnight, but if I really look – and I do, I have to admit, I check it several times a day – it’s definitely gotten a bit bigger. And… the edges seem less defined now. They were sharper when it first appeared. The color hasn’t changed much, but it’s… uneven, within the patch itself. Some parts are darker than others, if that makes sense. Honestly, it’s just unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Slow growth, changing borders, and uneven color within the patch are all important things to note. Have you noticed any itching, pain, bleeding, or other symptoms associated with this discoloration?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No itching, no pain. It doesn’t bother me physically at all. It's purely cosmetic, which is… frustrating, because I take such good care of myself. No bleeding either, not even when I bump it against things – and I’ve certainly bumped it, given where it is. It just… is. It’s a bit of an eyesore, really. I'd hoped it would just go away on its own, but obviously, it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching, pain, or bleeding, and it hasn't resolved on its own. That's good to know. Now, let's go through some general medical questions. Have you had any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel perfectly fine, thank you. Usual energy levels. I eat reasonably well, exercise a few times a week – nothing strenuous, just walking and some Pilates. I haven’t been ill recently, no new aches or pains, no weight loss or gain. My husband keeps telling me I’m too healthy for my own good. He says I should at least have a little sniffle to justify all the vitamins I take. But truly, no. Everything is quite…normal. Except for this, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, generally. Pilates and walking are excellent. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. I had chickenpox as a child, that’s about it. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, I suppose. Nothing chronic, no surgeries, no major illnesses. I’m not on any medication at all, except for a multivitamin, which I already mentioned. My family history is… unremarkable, as far as I know. My parents are both still alive and relatively healthy, though my father has slightly high blood pressure. But that’s hereditary, he says. Otherwise, nothing that would be relevant here, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no medications, and a family history of only mild hypertension. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I eat everything – well, not everything, I’m not particularly fond of oysters, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I've had a few vaccinations over the years, as you asked before, and no problems there either. I'm not particularly sensitive to anything, really. I've always been quite robust, if I may say so myself. It's part of the reason I find this discoloration so perplexing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to take a look at the discoloration on your forearm. I’ll also palpate it to check its texture and depth. Can you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's right here, as you can see. Quite prominent, isn’t it? I do try to keep it covered as much as possible, it’s just… unpleasant to look at. I hope it’s nothing serious. Really, I do. I have a garden party next month, and I was rather hoping to wear a sleeveless dress. Silly, perhaps, but one does try to maintain appearances.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting an approximately 2.5 cm lesion with irregular borders and slightly raised texture. It feels firm to the touch. The color is uneven within the lesion, as you described, with shades of brown. No immediate surrounding skin changes. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, this lesion is concerning enough that I’d like to perform a biopsy to determine its exact nature. It could be a number of things, and a biopsy is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh. Well, I hadn't anticipated that. It sounds… rather invasive, doesn’t it? I mean, is it definitely necessary? Surely it could be something benign? I've always been rather squeamish, you see. And what if it's… unpleasant? I understand you need to be thorough, of course, but… is there any other way to be certain? Honestly, the thought of it… well, it’s not particularly appealing. I suppose if you insist, but I do wish there was a less drastic solution.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bartock, and I apologize for any anxiety this is causing you. You’re right to ask about less drastic solutions, and I want to assure you we explore all options. However, given the slow growth, irregular borders, and uneven color, it’s important to rule out any possibility of melanoma or other concerning skin conditions. A biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. It’s a relatively quick procedure. We’ll numb the area completely with a local anesthetic, so you won’t feel any pain. It involves removing a small sample of the lesion, which will then be sent to a pathologist for examination under a microscope. While it’s not entirely risk-free – there’s always a small chance of infection or scarring – these risks are minimal. We'll provide detailed aftercare instructions to minimize complications. I wouldn’t recommend a biopsy if I didn’t believe it was necessary to get a clear diagnosis and ensure your health. Waiting and observing could potentially allow a concerning condition to progress. Would you like me to explain the biopsy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you truly believe it’s necessary… then I suppose I have no choice. I hate needles, you see, and the thought of… of having a piece of my skin removed… But I understand what you're saying about being thorough. Yes, please. Explain the procedure. And tell me about the… the aftercare. What sort of scarring are we talking about? Will it be visible? I have a rather important luncheon next month, and I wouldn’t want… well, you understand. I suppose it's vain, but one does have standards. And honestly, the uncertainty is worse than the procedure itself, I think. Just… please be as gentle as possible.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock, and I assure you I will be as gentle as possible. The biopsy itself is quite quick, typically taking about 15-30 minutes. First, I’ll clean the area around the lesion with an antiseptic solution. Then, I’ll inject a local anesthetic – lidocaine – to numb the skin completely. You might feel a brief stinging sensation with the injection, but after that, you shouldn’t feel any pain. Once the area is numb, I'll use a small instrument – either a shave biopsy or a punch biopsy – to remove a small sample of the lesion. A shave biopsy removes the top layers of the skin, while a punch biopsy removes a small cylindrical piece of skin. We'll decide which method is best based on the characteristics of the lesion. After the biopsy, I’ll apply pressure to the site to stop any bleeding. You’ll receive a bandage to keep the area clean and protected. As for aftercare, it’s crucial to keep the area clean and dry. I'll provide you with specific instructions, but generally, you’ll need to change the bandage daily and apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. You should also avoid direct sun exposure and protect the area with sunscreen. Regarding scarring, there will likely be some minimal scarring. The appearance of the scar will depend on several factors, including the size of the biopsy site, your skin type, and your body’s healing process. We can discuss options for minimizing scarring, such as topical creams or, in some cases, a minor cosmetic procedure to improve the appearance of the scar. Typically, a small punch biopsy scar will be a small, pale mark that fades over time. A shave biopsy may leave a slightly discolored area that also fades over time. Do you have any questions about the procedure or aftercare at this point?
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too dreadful, I suppose. The minimal scarring is… reassuring. What sort of antibiotic ointment would you recommend? And how long would it take to heal? I really must look presentable for this luncheon. It’s with some rather important clients, you see. And what about infection? Is it common? I’m rather prone to worrying, I admit. And… would it be painful after the anesthetic wears off? I’ve always had a low pain threshold, I’m afraid. A bit of discomfort is tolerable, but I do prefer to be prepared. Honestly, it's the not knowing that upsets me the most.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock, and I’ll do my best to address them. For the antibiotic ointment, I typically recommend a topical application of bacitracin or neomycin, available over-the-counter. It helps prevent infection while the area heals. Healing time varies, but typically, a small biopsy site will heal within 1-2 weeks. It’s important to keep the area clean and protected during this time. We’ll have you come back for a follow-up appointment to remove any sutures and check the healing process. Regarding infection, it’s relatively uncommon, but it’s always a possibility. Signs of infection include increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, please contact us immediately. As for pain after the anesthetic wears off, you can expect some mild discomfort or soreness, similar to a minor scrape. You can manage this with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. We can also prescribe a stronger pain medication if needed, though most patients find over-the-counter options are sufficient. I will also provide you with detailed written instructions on how to care for the biopsy site, including wound care, signs of infection, and when to contact us. To summarize, we'll perform a small biopsy on your forearm, numb the area completely with local anesthetic, remove a small sample of the lesion, apply pressure to stop any bleeding, and provide you with instructions on wound care and pain management. We'll have you return for a follow-up appointment to remove any sutures and check the healing process. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, I suppose it does. It’s not ideal, but if it’s the only way to be certain… then let’s get it over with. Just… please be as quick and gentle as possible. And remind me again about the luncheon… how long will it take to heal? I really must look presentable. It’s a rather important event, you see. Perhaps a week? If I can cover it with makeup…? I suppose I should schedule the appointment then. And perhaps you could recommend a good dermatologist for scar revision, just in case? One never knows, does one?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I completely understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to make the procedure as quick and gentle as possible. Regarding the luncheon, most small biopsies heal within 7-14 days, but it’s best to allow a little extra time for complete healing. Covering the area with makeup is possible once the wound has started to close and the scab has fallen off, but I’d recommend consulting with me or a dermatologist before applying any makeup to ensure it doesn’t interfere with the healing process. To be on the safe side, I’d suggest scheduling the biopsy at least two weeks before your luncheon. This will give you ample time to heal and address any potential concerns. I can recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance, a board-certified dermatologist specializing in scar revision. She has excellent reviews and is known for her gentle approach. I can provide you with her contact information after the appointment. Let's go ahead and schedule the biopsy. Are you available next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon would be preferable. Around two o’clock, perhaps? That would give me ample time to prepare beforehand, and wouldn’t interfere with my bridge club. Yes, Tuesday at two o’clock will be fine. And thank you for the recommendation. Dr. Vance sounds… competent. I do hope I won’t need her services, but it’s reassuring to know there’s someone reliable available. Now… what paperwork do I need to fill out? I do hope it’s not too extensive. I’m rather busy, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Tuesday at 2:00 PM it is. I’ve scheduled you for a shave biopsy on your left forearm. As for paperwork, it’s a standard medical history form, allergy information, and consent form for the biopsy. It should take about 15-20 minutes to complete. You can find the forms online on our clinic's website, or we can provide you with paper copies when you arrive. I will have my assistant, Sarah, come and assist you with the paperwork when you arrive. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. I’m rather anxious, naturally, but I suppose one must face these things. Thank you for your patience and reassurance, Dr. Alanes. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. And please, do remind me again of the signs of infection, just to be certain. Better safe than sorry, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I understand your anxiety, and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. It’s always best to be prepared, and I commend you for taking a proactive approach. Regarding the signs of infection, please watch out for increased redness, swelling, pain, pus or drainage from the biopsy site, fever, chills, or a foul odor. If you experience any of these symptoms, please contact our office immediately. We’ll do our best to make the procedure as comfortable as possible, and we’ll provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to minimize the risk of complications. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, Ms. Bartock.
