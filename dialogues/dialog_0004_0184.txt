DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Morning to you too. Look here, I ain't got all day. It’s this… this shape of me. It’s botherin’ me, see? Always has. I want somethin’ done about it.
DOCTOR: “This shape of you,” you say. Could you elaborate on that a bit, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What kinda question is that? I’m too thin, alright? Always been too thin. Skin and bones. Like a scarecrow. My wife… bless her soul… she always said I needed to fill out. Now she’s gone and I just… I just want to look presentable. You know, not like I’m about to blow away in the wind.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You’re concerned about your weight, specifically that you feel you are too thin. And you’d like to discuss options to gain weight. How long have you been concerned about this, and has your weight been consistently low, or has there been a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent change? Lord, woman, all my life! Seventy-six years on this Earth, and I’ve been this way. My mother, she was the same. Small build, always. It’s just… it’s worse now, you know? After my wife… well, things ain’t been the same. I eat, I really do, but it just… disappears. Like it goes into nothin’.
DOCTOR: So, this has been a lifelong issue, but you feel it's become more pronounced since your wife passed. You mentioned you eat, but it feels like it doesn't stay with you. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Humph. A typical day… Alright. I get up, have a cup of coffee – black, no sugar. Then, maybe some oatmeal. Not much. Lunch, usually a little bit of fish and some rice. Small portion. And dinner… well, dinner’s the biggest meal, maybe some chicken, some vegetables, a little bit of potatoes. But it don't stick, see? I eat it, and then… nothing. Like I barely had a bite. And I drink plenty water too.
DOCTOR: Okay. Black coffee, oatmeal, fish and rice for lunch, chicken, vegetables and potatoes for dinner, with water throughout the day. And you say you don’t feel full after meals, even dinner?
PATIENT: That's right. Empty. Like a hollow drum. I used to work hard, see? Pile driver operator. Used to burn through calories. But I’m retired now. Ain’t doin’ much of nothin’. You’d think that would help, but it don’t. It just… don’t.
DOCTOR: Right. So, reduced physical activity, but still experiencing this lack of weight gain and feeling of emptiness after eating. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or any nausea or vomiting after you eat?
PATIENT: Nausea? Vomiting? No! What kinda question is that now? I just… feel empty. Like there’s a hole inside. Ain't nothin' comin' up. It just… disappears. I tell ya, woman, I'm a simple man. I eat, it goes in, and it don't stay. That’s all there is to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Now you askin' about that? Look, I didn’t come here for a… a… a check-up on everything! I came here 'cause I'm too skinny! What does my… my business have to do with anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, but they are necessary to get a complete picture of your health. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes indicate problems with nutrient absorption, which could explain your weight loss. It's important to rule out any underlying medical issues. Are you having more frequent bowel movements than usual, or have you noticed any diarrhea?
PATIENT: Diarrhea? No! I just… I just want to put on a little weight, alright? Is that too much to ask? I ain’t here to talk about… about that stuff. I’m a simple man, I tell you! I eat, I don’t gain, and I’m tired of bein’ a scarecrow. Can we just… can we just talk about makin’ me look a little less… fragile?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, I am a physician, and I need to investigate why you are not gaining weight before I can simply suggest a way to help you gain weight. Ignoring potential underlying medical conditions would be irresponsible. Have you had any recent blood tests or seen another doctor for this issue?
PATIENT: Blood tests? No! Never had a need for 'em! I work hard all my life, been strong, and never needed a doctor for nothin'! This is new, see? Since… since my wife. I just want to look… decent. Maybe a little somethin' to fill me out. You makin' it sound like I got some terrible disease!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Given your history and the recent change coinciding with your wife’s passing, we need to consider several possibilities. It’s possible this is related to grief and loss of appetite, but we must rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check your nutrient levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weight loss. Do I have your consent for these tests?
PATIENT: Humph. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But I’m tellin' you, it’s just grief. But… alright. Blood work. Just get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood now. After the results come back, we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I want you to keep a detailed food diary, recording everything you eat and drink, and the time you consume it. That will help us get a better understanding of your current intake. I also recommend consulting with a grief counselor; loss can significantly affect appetite and overall health. Here is a list of local resources. Do you have any questions before the technician arrives?
PATIENT: Grief counselor? Look, I been grievin' just fine on my own, thank you very much. And a food diary? Now you want me to write down every little bite? This is ridiculous! But… alright. Fine. I’ll… I’ll try the diary. But don’t expect much. Just get this over with. I ain’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you have any discomfort during the blood draw. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up.
