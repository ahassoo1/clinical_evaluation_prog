DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My… how you say… they need paper for the… the place I want to live? For old people. They need doctor to say I am okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, the assisted living facility needs a medical evaluation to confirm you're healthy enough to move in. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly do that. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I feel… mostly good. Sometimes my knees hurt, you know? When I walk too much. And… I forget things sometimes. Not big things, just… where I put my glasses. Or what I was going to say. Is normal for old lady, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi, some aches and pains and occasional forgetfulness are common as we get older. But it's still important for me to get a full picture of what's going on. Let's talk about your knees first. How long have they been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Maybe… five years? Not every day. When it is cold, or if I walk up the hill to the store. Is not so bad if I take it slow. I use a cane sometimes, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of intermittent knee pain, worse with cold weather and walking uphill. You use a cane as needed. Do you experience any swelling or stiffness in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. After I walk a lot. Not big swelling, just… puffy. And stiff… yes, in the morning. It takes a little to get going. Like an old car!
DOCTOR: An old car, I understand perfectly. Okay, puffy swelling after activity and morning stiffness. Do you have any pain in other joints – your hips, ankles, wrists, or hands, for example?
PATIENT: No, just the knees. My hands… sometimes they ache a little, but not like the knees. Just… tired. From working, you know? I am… was a bartender. For many years. Still work a little, but not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily knee pain with some hand aching from previous work. Now, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Like I say, not big things. I do not forget who people are. Or how to cook. Just… I go into a room, and I forget why I went there. Or I look for my keys, and they are right in front of me! Little things. My husband, he laughs. He says I am always losing my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s common to experience memory lapses as we age. It’s good that your husband is able to laugh with you about it. Has this forgetfulness been getting worse lately, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: I think… maybe a little worse. Not much. But I worry. My sister, she… she has bad memory. Very bad. I do not want that. She… she needs someone to take care of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your sister’s experience. It's good you're being proactive about this. We'll definitely take a closer look. Let's move on to some other things. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. No… not really. I sleep okay. I eat okay. Sometimes I feel tired, but who does not? I have no pain anywhere else. I go to the bathroom okay. Is there something I am forgetting to tell you?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good. It sounds like you're generally in good health overall. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Many years ago, I had my gallbladder out. And… I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago! No other surgeries, I don't think. And I have not been sick with anything bad for a long time. Just little colds sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and a broken arm in childhood. No other surgeries or serious illnesses. That's helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure. Small blue one. And sometimes, when my knees hurt, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. And… I take a vitamin D pill, because the doctor said I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I have never had a problem. My husband, he is allergic to cats, but I am not.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had diabetes. And my father… he had heart problems. Many of my brothers and sisters, they have high blood pressure, like me. And… my sister, the one with bad memory, her mother also had memory problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, and memory issues. That’s helpful information. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I live with my husband. We have a small house with a garden. I like to cook. And I like to visit my grandchildren. I go to church on Sundays. I do not drink much alcohol anymore. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to smoke, but I stopped many years ago.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Ms. Abdollahi. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do. I want to make sure I am okay for the old people’s place.
DOCTOR: Great. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that good?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on that. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table, and I'll gently bend and straighten them?
PATIENT: Okay. Be careful, please. They sometimes feel… crunchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s some crepitus – that’s the crunchy feeling you mentioned – and a mild tenderness when I bend them. There’s no significant swelling, but I can feel a little bit of fluid buildup. Range of motion is slightly limited. Your ligaments seem stable. Overall, it seems like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which is common for someone your age. It's not severe, but it is likely contributing to your pain and stiffness. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. That completes the physical exam. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. If it helps me get into the old people’s place, I will do it. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Good. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process the results. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m happy to provide a note to the assisted living facility stating that you’ve been evaluated and are generally in stable health. I’ll include my findings from today’s exam and the plan for the blood tests. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That is very kind of you, Doctor. The paper for the place… is that enough? Will they let me in?
DOCTOR: Based on my exam today, you are generally in stable health. The note I will provide will detail your findings and the plan for the blood tests. It should be sufficient for the assisted living facility, however, ultimately their admission criteria is their decision. I will also note that you are able to ambulate with minimal assistance and are cognitively intact. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You are very nice, Doctor Tosca. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was a pleasure meeting you. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day!
