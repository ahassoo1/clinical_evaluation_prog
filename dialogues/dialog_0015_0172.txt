DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My husband insisted, you see. Said I ought to establish care with someone new to the area. He worries, constantly. It’s…rather tiresome, frankly. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, while it's admirable your husband is concerned, establishing primary care is a good idea, even if you feel perfectly well. It allows us to get a baseline of your health, should anything do arise. It will take some time, Ms. Engelhaupt, as we'll need to go over your medical history, perform a physical exam, and likely some routine lab work. We can certainly try to be efficient. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any specific health concerns at all that you’d like to discuss, even if you don’t think they’re serious?
PATIENT: Serious concerns? Heavens, no. I feel…adequate. A little stiff in the mornings, perhaps. It’s the weather, I suspect. And my vision isn't what it used to be, but that’s to be expected at my age. Honestly, Doctor, I pride myself on being a remarkably healthy woman. I've never been one to complain. Are we required to list every ache and pain since childhood? Because I assure you, it would be a lengthy endeavor.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Engelhaupt. We don’t need a complete life history. But a general overview helps us understand what’s normal for you, and what might be new. "Adequate" is good to hear, but “stiff in the mornings” and changes in vision are worth noting. Let’s focus on the present, then. When did you first notice the morning stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice…? It’s been…some time. Months, certainly. Possibly longer. It comes and goes, really. Some days are worse than others. I simply assumed it was the bed. A new mattress is terribly expensive, you know. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not certain it’s worth discussing in such detail. It’s just…old age creeping in, I suppose. I'd rather speak of something more…substantial.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your…directness, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, dismissing symptoms as “old age” isn’t particularly helpful. Stiffness for months does warrant investigation. It could be a number of things, and the sooner we determine the cause, the better. To clarify, is this stiffness isolated to the mornings, or does it persist throughout the day?
PATIENT: Persists? Heavens, no. It’s mornings, Doctor. That’s why I said it! After I’ve had my coffee and gotten moving, it usually subsides. I’m a very active woman, you see. I volunteer at the historical society. It requires a great deal of standing and…well, doing. I certainly don’t spend my days wallowing in discomfort. Really, I feel perfectly capable.
DOCTOR: "Perfectly capable" is good to hear, Ms. Engelhaupt. And volunteering is excellent. So, the stiffness improves with activity. Is it worse after periods of rest, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: Specific activities? Doctor, are you attempting to create a medical treatise from a simple visit? I simply get up in the morning, and I’m a little stiff! It's hardly a complex equation. I suppose…it might be slightly worse after gardening. I do enjoy tending my roses, but it does require a fair amount of bending and kneeling. But I assure you, it’s nothing I can’t handle.
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, I’m simply trying to gather information to understand what's going on. Gardening is a relevant detail. Bending and kneeling puts strain on the joints. Let’s shift gears slightly. Do you experience any pain in your joints, or is it purely stiffness?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, good heavens, no. Not pain. Stiffness, yes. A little…resistance. But pain implies something dreadful, and I assure you, my joints are not dreadful. They’ve served me quite well over the years. Really, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather…unnecessary. I’ve lived a full life, I’m perfectly capable, and I’m certainly not on death’s door.
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, I understand your frustration. However, dismissing symptoms without investigation isn't wise. Stiffness, even without pain, can indicate underlying issues. It doesn't mean you're "on death's door," but it does warrant a closer look. To proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Specifically, I'll check your range of motion and assess your joints for any swelling or tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor. Must you? I’ve already told you I am perfectly capable. And I assure you, I do not appreciate being prodded and poked. I came here to establish care, not undergo an interrogation. If this is how you treat all your patients, I may reconsider this entire endeavor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, a basic physical exam is standard procedure when establishing care with a new patient, and is essential for assessing your overall health. It's not an "interrogation," and it's not about questioning your capabilities. It's about gathering objective data to ensure your well-being. I understand you are reluctant, but I cannot provide proper care without it. I assure you, it will be a brief and respectful examination. I will explain everything as I go. If you remain opposed, I can document your refusal. However, please understand that this limits my ability to address any potential health concerns. Would you like me to explain the specific parts of the exam I would be performing?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. Though I maintain it’s entirely unnecessary. And I expect you to be gentle. My skin is rather delicate, you know. Very well, explain yourself. But make it brief. I have a luncheon, Doctor. And honestly, this entire process is rather…demeaning.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then examining your joints – primarily your hands, wrists, elbows, and knees – for range of motion, swelling, and tenderness. I’ll also check your reflexes. I will be using my hands only, and will explain each step as I perform it. It should take no more than fifteen minutes. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. But do be quick about it. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had more pleasant interactions with…well, never mind. Just get on with it. And please, no unnecessary conversation. I find it…distracting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Blood pressure is 138/72. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, could you please open your mouth, and say “ah”?
PATIENT: “Ah.” There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never been fond of doctors poking around in my mouth. It’s…unhygienic. Are you certain your instruments are properly sterilized? I’ve heard dreadful stories…
DOCTOR: Throat appears clear. No signs of infection. Yes, all instruments are properly sterilized, Ms. Engelhaupt. Now, if you could just relax your hands for a moment, I'd like to assess your range of motion. First, can you make a fist, and then open your hand flat?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, Doctor, my hands aren't as nimble as they used to be. Gardening, you know. It takes a toll. And I do prefer wearing my rings, if that's at all possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, your hands are lovely. Gardening does take a toll. I see some slight swelling around the knuckles, and your range of motion is limited, particularly in flexion. Now, could you please gently bend your elbows?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s…uncomfortable. Are you certain this is necessary? I suspect it’s simply arthritis. My mother had it terribly. And I do believe it’s the weather. A damp chill is settling in, you know. It plays havoc with my joints. Really, Doctor, I fail to see the purpose of all this…prodding.
DOCTOR: I see. Some tenderness and slight crepitus when bending your elbows. It could be arthritis, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, to determine the exact cause, I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test. It will also be helpful to get some X-rays of your hands and elbows. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests? Honestly, Doctor, must you? I suppose…if you insist. But I’m not certain I have the energy for all this. And I do have a luncheon. Can’t you simply prescribe something for the arthritis? My mother swore by a certain cream…and a good strong cup of tea, of course.
DOCTOR: Prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis isn’t advisable, Ms. Engelhaupt. While your mother’s remedy may have provided relief, it’s important to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The blood work and X-rays will provide valuable information. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk. They will schedule you for blood work. And we’ll arrange for the X-rays to be taken at the imaging center across the street. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for pain relief, if needed. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks, once the results are available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Two weeks. Very well. But do try to keep it brief. Honestly, Doctor, I have a busy schedule. And I do expect a prompt diagnosis. I have no patience for endless tests and speculation. Two weeks. And I suppose I should inform my luncheon companion that I might be…delayed.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will ensure your results are expedited. And I understand your time is valuable. Here is a lab requisition form, and the address for the imaging center. I will see you in two weeks. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I believe that’s quite enough for today. Good day, Doctor. And do try to be more efficient with your next patient. Honestly, the entire experience has been…rather trying. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. Have a pleasant day.
