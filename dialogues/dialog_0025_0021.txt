DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Fourney. It’s nice to meet you too. My foot, it’s been swelling up, see? Mostly just this one, my left one. It started a couple days ago, and it's gettin' bigger each day, I think. Not a lot, but noticeable. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when I… well, when I walk on it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Swelling, you say. And it’s localized to the left foot, starting a couple of days ago. Does it feel warm to the touch, or is there any redness associated with it?
PATIENT: Let me… Warm… yeah, I think so. It feels warmer than my other foot, if that makes sense. And… yeah, there is some redness, now that you mention it. Not bright red, but kinda… pinkish? It's hard to see 'cause of my skin, but it's there. I always have a bit of a darker complexion, you know? It’s just more noticeable now with the swelling.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's good you noticed the warmth and the color change. Now, have you had any injury to the foot recently?
PATIENT: Injury? No, not that I recall. I haven't twisted it or anything, or dropped anything on it. I walk a lot, you know, to get around, but I haven’t had any… accidents. I was workin' yesterday, doin' interviews, mostly sittin’ down, but I was on my feet a bit movin' people around. But that’s normal. Nothing special happened, I swear. I’d remember if I’d hurt it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say you walk a lot, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a loan interviewer, so I’m at the office most days. That means a lot of sittin', but I gotta walk between offices, help folks fill out forms, show ‘em where things are. Then, to get to work, I take the bus, and gotta walk a good ten minutes from the bus stop to the office, and ten minutes back at the end of the day. Sometimes I walk to the store, you know, for groceries. It’s not like I’m runnin’ marathons or anything, but I’m on my feet for a few hours, definitely. Just regular stuff, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any pain in your calf at all?
PATIENT: Calf? Hmm… let me think. No, not really. It doesn't hurt up there, just the foot itself, when I put weight on it. Maybe a little achy sometimes, but not a sharp pain, you know? Just… tired feelin', if that makes sense. I don't usually pay much attention to my calves, to be honest. Is that… is that something I should be feelin'?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me everything, even what you don't think is important. Calf pain can sometimes be related to foot issues. Now, let's talk about other medical conditions. Do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, the doctor a few years back said my blood pressure was a little high, but he said to just watch my salt and it went down when I started watchin' it. Other than that… no, nothin' really. No diabetes, no heart problems. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, though, to be honest. Too expensive, you know? And I usually feel alright. Does that count for somethin'?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know. We'll proceed as if you haven’t been regularly checked. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just the basic stuff, but that’s it. Really. Just the vitamins, and I don’t even take those every day. I try to get what I need from my food. Old-fashioned, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at the foot itself. Could you remove your shoe and sock, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go, Doctor. Hope it doesn’t smell too bad! It’s been a warm day. Let me know if you need me to move it around or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting some definite swelling and redness, as you mentioned. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished on this foot compared to your right. The area is tender to the touch, particularly along the inside of your ankle. I don't feel any obvious masses or deformities. Let me also check your range of motion. There’s some discomfort with range of motion. It doesn't appear to be a fracture, but it’s too early to rule that out completely. Given the swelling, redness, and your description of the symptoms, I suspect you might have a sprain or early signs of a deep vein thrombosis, though the pulses being present make that less likely. We need to be cautious.
PATIENT: A… a sprain? Or… what was the other thing you said? Deep… something? That kinda hurts. I just thought I maybe twisted it somehow, without even realizing. I haven’t been doin’ anything strenuous, like I said. A thrombosis… is that serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I don’t like hearin’ about things bein’ serious.
DOCTOR: A sprain means you've stretched or torn the ligaments in your ankle. A deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can be serious, because the clot can travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. That's why we need to rule it out. The pulses being present is a good sign, but we can't rely on that alone. To be safe, I want to order a D-dimer blood test. It will help us determine if there's a blood clot present. I’m also going to order an X-ray of your foot to rule out a fracture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test and an X-ray… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. That sounds alright. I don’t like needles, but… I’ll do what I gotta do. And… how long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if it is one of those serious things? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don't have insurance, you know. Everything costs so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Parascandola. We'll proceed carefully. The lab work should take about an hour or two. The X-ray will be quicker, we can get those results within minutes. If the D-dimer comes back positive, it doesn’t automatically mean you have a DVT, but it will necessitate further imaging, likely an ultrasound. If a DVT is confirmed, you would need anticoagulation medication to prevent the clot from growing and potentially traveling to your lungs, and yes, that would likely require a hospital stay for initiation of treatment and monitoring. We can discuss financial assistance programs available at the hospital if that becomes necessary. For now, let's get the tests done. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re taking these precautions to ensure we get a clear diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and take you for the X-ray. Do you have any allergies to latex or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to latex, not to anything. Okay. Blood test and X-ray. I’ll just… sit here and wait, I guess. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. It helps a little, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Just… let me know if there’s anything… bad. I’d rather just know, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola. I understand. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and let you know immediately. The nurse will be in shortly to take you for the blood draw and the X-ray. Try to elevate your foot in the meantime, and avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. I’ll be back as soon as I have the results.
