DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you’re 51 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Blim, is it? Yes, 51… feels like yesterday, honestly. Um… well, they said I needed to come in for… a check. A screening, I think? Something about… making sure things are okay. Honestly, I don’t recall all the details. It was a lot of phone calls.
DOCTOR: A “check,” you say. Right. Well, Medicare does have certain preventative screenings they recommend. Let's try to be more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Was it… something to do with… things I might be taking? I take a few things for… you know, aches and pains. Old job. Lots of heavy lifting. But I can’t rightly remember if this was about that. It’s all a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Aches and pains… of course. Let me access your electronic health record. Ah, yes. It appears you had a phone call regarding a bone density scan, and a review of your current medications and potential interactions. Is that… ringing any bells?
PATIENT: Bone density… Oh! Maybe… bones? I did fall last winter. Not a bad fall, thankfully, just a bit of a tumble on the ice. But… a scan? I don’t… I don’t think anyone said anything about a scan. Just… a check-up. Are they the same thing? I get so mixed up with all these appointments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, a “check-up” is rather broad. A bone density scan specifically assesses your bone strength, which is prudent given your fall and… age. We need to rule out osteoporosis. Now, let’s get a proper history. Have you been experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Oh, osteoporosis… that sounds… serious. Well, I always have a little ache somewhere. Old job, like I said. Knees mostly. And my back. But it’s… normal. It comes and goes. Nothing new, I don’t think. Just… the usual wear and tear. Is that what you mean by “new”? Like, worse pain? I haven’t noticed anything particularly worse.
DOCTOR: “Usual wear and tear” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Hughston. We need specifics. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your typical knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, a number… Zero to ten… Hmm. Well, on a good day, maybe a two? Just a little twinge. But if I’ve been on my feet a lot, or it’s cold… maybe a five or six? Sometimes worse if it rains. It’s hard to say, really. It changes all the time. I’m not very good with numbers, Doctor. I always forget which way is bad.
DOCTOR: A five or six… fluctuating, naturally. And your back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, the back… that’s… more of a constant thing, I suppose. Not sharp, you understand. Just… dull. Like a weight. Maybe a three, on a good day? Sometimes it flares up if I bend over too much, then maybe a five. But that doesn’t happen often. It's just… always there, a little bit. Does that make any sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: A constant three, flaring to a five… Yes, Ms. Hughston, I am following. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling? Oh, sometimes my feet get a little cold. Especially in the winter. And… sometimes they feel a little… prickly? But I just thought that was the circulation. I get cold feet easily. Is that what you mean? I don't think I've ever had proper numbness, like… can't feel anything at all. Are we getting closer to what this appointment is for? I’m still a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it appears we are establishing a baseline of… generalized discomfort. Now, let’s discuss your medications. What exactly are you taking, and for what conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, the medications… Well, let’s see… There’s this one, for my blood pressure. The little white one. And this one, the orange one, is for… my arthritis, I think. The doctor gave it to me a while back. And then there’s this one, the blue one, which is just… for aches and pains, generally. And… oh, and sometimes I take this one, the green one, if I can’t sleep. I honestly can't remember all the names. They change them so often! And I forget which one does what, sometimes. It's a bit of a mess, really. Do you need me to read off all the little numbers on the bottles?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, please. Let us start with the little white one for your blood pressure. Read the dosage and the manufacturer's name, if you please. We need to be precise.
PATIENT: Oh dear… this is tiny. Okay… um… it says… Lisinopril… 20 milligrams… and… Mylan… is that the manufacturer? Yes, Mylan. And… it says “take one tablet daily.” That’s about all I can make out. It's very small writing, Doctor. I need my glasses for this sort of thing, you know. I left them in the car.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg… acceptable. Now, the orange one for your “arthritis.” Let's proceed. Dosage and manufacturer, please. And try to be concise, Ms. Hughston. My schedule is rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… this one’s even smaller! Let me see… it says… Naproxen… 500 milligrams… and… Sandoz… is that the manufacturer? Yes, Sandoz. And… it says “take one tablet twice a day with food.” I really should get my eyes checked. This is terribly difficult. I’m not trying to be difficult, Doctor, I promise. It’s just… everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Naproxen 500mg… twice daily. Now, the blue one… for “aches and pains generally.” Proceed. I trust you recall the dosage on this one?
PATIENT: Oh dear… this one… I honestly don't remember. It's a small one… It says… Tramadol… 50 milligrams… and… Teva… is that the manufacturer? Yes, Teva. And… it says “take one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain.” Tramadol… I think that’s a strong one, isn’t it? I don't take it very often, just when the pain is really bad. It makes me a bit… sleepy.
DOCTOR: Tramadol 50mg… as needed?
PATIENT: Yes… well, that’s what the doctor told me. Just when I really need it. I try not to take too many. Honestly, I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. But sometimes the pain is just too much. I usually take one, maybe two if it’s a really bad day. Is that… bad? I just try to get through the day, you know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, taking Tramadol “as needed” can be… problematic. It's an opioid, and regular use, even intermittent, carries risks. And combining it with Naproxen… increases the potential for gastrointestinal complications. Now, let's finish this. The green one… for sleep. Dosage and manufacturer. And please, try to be precise. This is important.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… this one's tiny too. It says… Trazodone… 50 milligrams… and… Accord… is that the manufacturer? Yes, Accord. And… it says “take one tablet at bedtime as needed for sleep.” I only take it when I really can't sleep, Doctor. Maybe once or twice a week. It helps me get a few hours of rest. I just want to be able to get through the night without tossing and turning. I haven't been sleeping well for years. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, your medication regimen is… suboptimal. The combination of Tramadol, Naproxen, and Trazodone, even at your reported dosages, presents several concerns. And the “as needed” nature of your Tramadol use is… particularly troubling. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urine drug screen. We need to assess the impact of these medications on your overall health. And frankly, I’m referring you to a pain management specialist. This situation requires a more specialized approach. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… a blood test? And… a pain specialist? Oh dear… I don’t like needles. And… a specialist? What’s wrong? Is something seriously wrong? I just came in for a check-up… I didn’t realize it was going to be so… complicated. I feel a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. I… I don't understand all this. Is there something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, while I assure you there is no immediate cause for panic, your current approach to pain management is… unsustainable. The blood tests will provide a baseline assessment of your organ function. The urine drug screen is standard procedure. As for the pain specialist, they will evaluate your condition and develop a more comprehensive, and safer, treatment plan. Frankly, relying on a combination of opioids, NSAIDs, and sedatives is… less than ideal. My nurse will schedule the blood tests and provide you with a referral form for the specialist. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No… no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with any medications before… except maybe a little bit sleepy with the Trazodone. But… I don't understand. I just wanted something for the pain. And to be able to sleep. Is there something wrong with the pills themselves? Are they… bad for me? I’ve been taking them for years… I just thought they were helping. I feel a bit… scared now, Doctor. What’s going to happen? I just wanted to get through the day… is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, I understand your concerns. However, long-term use of these medications, even at the dosages you’ve reported, carries inherent risks. We need to address the underlying cause of your pain, rather than simply masking the symptoms. The pain specialist will conduct a thorough evaluation and develop a more appropriate treatment plan. Now, I have other patients waiting. My nurse will provide you with detailed instructions regarding the blood tests and the referral. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… the tests and the specialist, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I just… hope everything will be okay. I think I’ll just… go wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
