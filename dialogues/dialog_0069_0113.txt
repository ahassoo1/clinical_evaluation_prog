DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Seems a fancy name. Well, I’m here about… going to the bathroom. A lot. It’s bothersome, really. More than it used to be, anyway. I just keep having to go. It’s… frequent. That’s the word, isn't it? Frequent. My wife, bless her heart, she said I should come get it checked.
DOCTOR: Yes, “frequent” is a good way to describe it. And it’s definitely worth getting it checked out, especially if it’s a new change. Okay, so you’re experiencing increased frequency of urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Increased… right. Well, it’s not like I can’t hold it, exactly. It’s just… I feel like I need to go more often. Throughout the day, mostly. Even at night, sometimes. Not every night, mind you. Just… enough to be annoying. I don’t know what’s changed. I drink the same amount of tea as always, and I haven’t been eating anything different. Though, maybe the tomatoes… My wife’s been growing a lot of tomatoes this year. Could be those, I suppose. Though I like my tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, throughout the day and occasionally at night. And you haven’t noticed any major changes in your diet or fluid intake, besides potentially the tomatoes. It’s good you’re thinking about things like that. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you feel the urge to go, is it a sudden, strong urge, or does it build up gradually?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Let me think. It’s not… painful, not exactly. It just comes on. Not a sudden rush, not usually. It’s more like… a feeling. A pressure, maybe? And then I realize I need to go. It doesn’t hurt to wait a little, but I don’t want to wait, if you understand. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. I’m not a doctor, you know. I just grow things. And… help people grow things. It’s a simple life. But this… this is not so simple.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No, you’re not expected to be a doctor! And you’re explaining it perfectly. A gradual pressure, not a painful urge, and a desire to go sooner rather than later. That's very helpful. Now, besides the frequency, have you noticed any other changes when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… Well, the stream isn’t as… strong as it used to be. It’s not weak, mind you, but it doesn't shoot like it used to when I was younger. And sometimes… sometimes it takes a little bit to get started. A little hesitation, you could say. Not every time, but more often now than it used to. My wife says I’m getting old. She’s probably right. But I still feel good, mostly. Just this… bathroom business is bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased stream strength, and sometimes a hesitation starting. Those are important things to know. We’re building a good picture here. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine, or any blood when you go?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Definitely not. My wife would have noticed that right away. She’s very observant, that woman. As for the color… well, it's usually yellow, I suppose. Sometimes a bit darker if I haven’t had enough to drink. But nothing… unusual. I don’t pay much attention to it, to be honest. I have tomatoes to worry about, you know? And beans. And… well, a lot of things. Urine color isn’t high on the list. Does it matter? Is something wrong? You're starting to worry me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. I'm not trying to worry you, just gathering information. It’s good you haven’t noticed any blood, and the color being normal is good as well. These are all pieces of the puzzle. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. The doctor put me on a little pill for it. I take it every morning. Don't remember the name, though. My wife handles all that. She keeps track of everything. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never been told that. I don’t eat much sugar, you see. Mostly just tea and… well, tomatoes. And beans. And the occasional piece of pie my wife makes. But not too much. She tries to keep me healthy. Though this bathroom business… it’s making me feel anything but healthy. Is that pill affecting it, do you think? Maybe I should stop taking it? I'll ask my wife...but she'll say no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. It's good you’re taking something for it. It’s possible the medication could contribute to urinary changes, though it’s not always the case. We shouldn’t stop any medication without discussing it first. Let’s hold off on that for now. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. When I was a young man, I had my tonsils taken out. That was… a long time ago. And… oh! Yes. I had a hernia operation years ago, too. Something about a bulge. My wife said I needed it done. She’s always right about these things. Aside from that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been a healthy man. Worked hard on the farm, you know. That’s good exercise. But this bathroom… it’s just not right. It’s making me feel old. And tired. And I can't keep running back and forth all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and hernia repair in the past. That’s good to know. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had a weak heart. Passed away when I was young. My mother… she had arthritis. Bad arthritis. Couldn’t move her hands very well towards the end. And… oh, my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had something with his kidneys. I don’t remember exactly what. Something about… stones, I think. She always said we should drink plenty of water. Which I do! Mostly. When I remember. And… oh, my wife's father, he had diabetes. A bad case of it. Lost his leg, poor man. So, yes, a lot of things. It seems like everyone in my family has something. Is that why I’m having trouble with my bathroom? Is it genetic? It's very worrisome.
DOCTOR: It sounds like there is a family history of several conditions, including heart disease, arthritis, kidney stones, and diabetes. It's understandable that you're worried. A family history can sometimes increase your risk, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop the same conditions. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it. And alcohol… I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small glass. Red wine, mostly. For my health, you know. My wife says it’s good for the heart. But not too much. She keeps track of everything. So, yes, a small glass of wine with dinner. That’s it. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I work on my farm, I drink my tea, I eat my tomatoes, I have a glass of wine with dinner, and I try to stay out of trouble. But this bathroom… it’s making everything difficult. It's very bothersome. I’m starting to get worried about something serious, something my family history hints at.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, and only a small glass of wine with dinner. That's good. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Just the pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it acts up. It’s a little cream, I rub it on my hands. Nothing else. My wife gets everything sorted. She’s very organized, that woman. She keeps a list of everything I take. I should probably pay more attention, but I trust her to handle it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting a bit tired of thinking about all this. It's just a lot. This bathroom… it’s been going on for a while now, and it's starting to really get to me. Is there anything seriously wrong? Should I be worried about… you know… something bad? I'm not a young man anymore. And this farm… it’s hard work. I need to be healthy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. It’s good you’re taking something for your arthritis. It sounds like your wife is a wonderful support. Okay, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That would involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a simple neurological exam. We'll also need to do a urine test to check for infection or other issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, alright. I suppose that’s a good idea. If it helps. Though I don’t expect to find anything. I feel… mostly alright, aside from the bathroom. And a urine test… yes, that’s fine. Though I don’t expect to find anything there either. I drink plenty of water, mostly. When I remember. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then I’ll do it. Just… please be quick. I have tomatoes to tend to, you know. And beans. A lot of things to take care of. And I’d like to get this sorted out as soon as possible. This bathroom… it’s just a nuisance. But I’m getting worried, and I'd like to know if it's something serious. And honestly, Doctor, I trust you to tell me the truth. My wife always says you're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate your trust, and I will do my best to get to the bottom of this for you. Your wife is right to have faith in me. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit back and relax, that would be great. It's 140/90 today, which is a little elevated. We may need to adjust your medication later. Now, if you could lie back on the exam table, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur. That's not necessarily a concern at your age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now I’ll just gently press on your abdomen. No tenderness here. And finally, a quick neurological exam. Everything seems normal there. Now, we just need a urine sample. There’s a cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. I'll meet you back here when you're finished.
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample… right. I remember those from when I was younger. Not fun, if you don’t mind me saying so. A little elevated blood pressure, you say? Perhaps the stress of this bathroom situation? And a slight murmur… well, I’m not a young man anymore. Things wear out, I suppose. Alright, I’ll go and collect the sample. It's not my favorite activity, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I'm hoping for good news. Or at least, not bad news. Just hoping it's nothing serious. Tomatoes are counting on me. And beans. And my wife. A lot of things are counting on me.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. A mid-stream sample, just as you requested. It wasn’t pleasant, if you don’t mind me saying so. But I did my best. Hopefully, it will tell you something useful. I'm getting a bit cold now, standing around like this. And a bit anxious, if I'm honest. Is there anything seriously wrong, Doctor? My wife will be worried if I come home with bad news. She takes everything to heart, that woman. She's been so supportive through all this... I just want to get back to my farm, tend to my tomatoes, and live a simple life. But this bathroom… it's just a nuisance, a constant worry. Please tell me everything is alright. Or, at least, not too bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. You did great, and I appreciate your patience. I’m going to send this sample to the lab for a urinalysis. That will check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. While we wait, let’s talk about your symptoms a bit more. You mentioned the frequent urination. Does it get worse at night, causing you to wake up multiple times to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the lab. Good, good. Hopefully it will tell us something useful. As for the nighttime… well, yes, sometimes. Not every night, mind you. But a couple of times a week, I have to get up. It’s annoying, really. Wakes my wife up, too. She doesn’t mind, bless her heart. Says it’s just a sign of getting older. But I don’t like disturbing her sleep. And it’s cold getting out of bed in the middle of the night. Not a pleasant experience. It’s not terrible, mind you. Just… inconvenient. I usually only go once, maybe twice, if it’s a bad night. But it’s enough to disrupt my sleep. And I need my sleep, you know? To tend to my tomatoes. And beans. A lot of things to take care of. I'm starting to get worried about this all, Doctor. Is it something serious? Something that needs… well, something drastic? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. My wife would be heartbroken. And who would take care of the tomatoes? And the beans? It’s a simple life, but it’s important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. Getting up at night to urinate, called nocturia, can have several causes. It doesn't necessarily mean something drastic is going on, but it's good we're investigating. While we wait for the lab results, let’s discuss your diet a bit more. Do you drink caffeinated beverages like coffee or tea?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the tea. That's a good question, Doctor. I do. I drink tea. Several cups a day. Mostly black tea. It helps me wake up in the morning. And it's… comforting. My wife makes it for me, just the way I like it. Strong, with a little bit of sugar. Though I try not to put too much sugar in it. She worries about my health, you know? But I need my tea. It helps me focus on my farm. And it's a habit, really. I've been drinking tea for as long as I can remember. Could the tea be causing this? Is that possible? I don't want to give up my tea. It's one of the few pleasures I have. And it keeps my wife happy. She enjoys making it for me, just the way I like it. Perhaps we should cut back a little? Just to see if it makes a difference? I'm willing to try anything, as long as it doesn't involve giving up my tomatoes. And my beans. And my farm. This whole situation is quite worrisome, Doctor. I just want to get back to my simple life.
DOCTOR: It's definitely possible the tea could be contributing to your symptoms, Mr. Segretto. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it can increase urine production. It’s a good idea to consider cutting back on your tea intake, just as a trial. We don’t have to eliminate it completely, just reduce it to see if that makes a difference. Ah, the lab results are back. Your urine sample shows no evidence of infection, which is good. However, there is a small amount of protein present. It’s not a large amount, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. This could indicate a kidney problem, or potentially something affecting your blood vessels. It’s too early to say for sure, but I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and other important markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Protein… in my urine? That doesn't sound good, Doctor. Not good at all. Kidney problem… oh dear. I've heard about kidney problems. My uncle had something with his kidneys, I think. Something about stones. This is getting quite worrisome. Blood tests… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary, then I'll do it. But I don't like the sound of this. Not one bit. I'm starting to get quite anxious, Doctor. Is it something serious? Something that requires… well, something drastic? My wife will be heartbroken if something happens to me. She takes everything to heart, that woman. And who would take care of the tomatoes? And the beans? I'm not a young man anymore, Doctor. I need to get this sorted out quickly. This whole situation is quite distressing, to be honest. Could it be the tea? Perhaps I should just give up tea altogether? Though I don't know what I'd do without my tea. It's one of the few pleasures I have. Perhaps we should just focus on the blood tests for now? And hope for good news? Or, at least, not too bad news?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto, let's focus on the blood tests for now. That will give us the most information. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, and it may not be anything serious at all. We're just being thorough. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a prostate-specific antigen test. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate health, which can sometimes cause urinary symptoms. We’ll need to schedule another appointment in a few days to review the results. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your caffeine intake, just as a precaution. And try not to worry too much. Stress can exacerbate your symptoms. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Prostate health… oh dear. I’ve heard about that too. My neighbor had something with his prostate. Not a pleasant experience, if I recall correctly. And reducing my caffeine intake… well, that will be difficult. Very difficult. It’s a habit, you see. A comforting habit. But I suppose I can try. For my health. And for my wife. She wouldn’t want me worrying about my tomatoes if something happens to me. Comprehensive metabolic panel… complete blood count… it all sounds quite daunting, Doctor. I’m not a young man anymore, and these tests… they sound serious. Will they be painful? Will they take a long time? I have tomatoes to tend to, you know. And beans. A lot of things to take care of. And I'm getting quite anxious, to be honest. This whole situation is quite distressing. Perhaps I should just focus on the tomatoes for now? And hope for the best? But I suppose I have no choice, do I? I need to get these tests done. For my health. And for my wife. And for my tomatoes. Oh dear. What if something is seriously wrong? What if…
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it’s okay to feel anxious. It's completely natural to be worried when you're facing uncertainty. The blood tests are relatively simple and shouldn’t be painful. They’ll involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It’ll take about 10-15 minutes, and then we'll send the sample to the lab. We should have the results back in a few days. I know you're worried about your tomatoes and beans, and I completely understand. But taking care of your health is the most important thing. We're just being thorough and ruling out any potential issues. We haven't even confirmed anything is wrong yet, and it may be something simple. Let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for a few days from now, and we'll discuss the results together. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on the things you enjoy. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Here's my card. Don't hesitate to call if you're feeling anxious or have any questions before our follow-up appointment. Let’s get you scheduled for these tests. Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable right now?
PATIENT: A comfortable feeling… well, that would be nice. Thank you, Doctor. For your reassurance. And for your patience. I suppose I'm just a worrier by nature. My wife says it's a sign of getting older. And I suppose she's right. A comfortable feeling… perhaps a cup of tea? Though I suppose that would defeat the purpose. Thank you for offering, Doctor. I'll try to relax. And focus on my tomatoes. And my beans. But it's difficult. Very difficult. Especially when I'm worrying about my prostate. And my kidneys. And my urine. Oh dear. Perhaps I should just focus on getting these tests done. And hope for the best. Thank you for scheduling the follow-up appointment. And for your card. I'll call if I'm feeling anxious. Or if something happens to my tomatoes. I suppose that's all for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your support. And for your patience. It means a lot. I'll see you in a few days. I hope everything is alright. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and try to relax.
