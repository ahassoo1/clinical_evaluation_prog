DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like… like it’s harder to get air then. I don’t know why it does that. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. Trouble breathing is never something to ignore, and we'll figure out what's going on. When you say it’s harder to get air when you lie flat, can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a tightness. In my chest, I suppose. And I feel like I have to… work at it, to breathe. Like it’s not coming naturally. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting up, or standing. Only when I’m lying down. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? A little longer, perhaps. I try to sleep propped up on pillows, and that helps some. But it's not very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness in the chest that requires effort when lying flat, improving with pillows, and present for about a month. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Let me think… No coughing, no fever. My ankles… they do swell up a bit at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on my feet too long at the library. And sometimes… sometimes my heart feels like it’s… fluttering. Not a strong flutter, just a little… skip. It doesn’t last long. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to know, Maribeth. The ankle swelling and the occasional fluttering in your heart are definitely things we should consider. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on a pill for it, and it’s been under control for years. And… oh, years ago, I had a bad case of pneumonia. But I recovered fully. Apart from that… nothing much, really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, for my age. I don't remember anything else. Do you need to know about childhood illnesses? Because I can't recall them very well.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Controlled high blood pressure is important, and it's good the pneumonia resolved. We don’t need to worry about childhood illnesses unless they caused any long-term problems. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see... No, I don't believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. And I had a small mole removed from my back a few years back, but that was a simple thing, done right in the doctor’s office. Nothing that required a hospital stay, or anything like that. Are we getting closer to finding out what's wrong? I truly would like to know, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: No major surgeries, just tonsillectomy and a mole removal. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a difficult question. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired, and she passed away when she was quite young, from… well, from heart trouble, I suppose. My father, he was healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in his life. As for my siblings… my brother had diabetes, but he lived a long life, despite it. And my sister… she had arthritis, mostly. I'm not sure if any of it is relevant to my breathing, though. It's all a bit muddled in my memory. It was so long ago, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble on your mother’s side and diabetes in your brother. That’s good information to have. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I always thought it was a dreadful habit. My husband, bless his soul, smoked a pipe for years, but I always made him smoke outside. I can’t stand the smell of it. And I’ve never touched alcohol, either. Always been a very… sensible person, you see. Can we get this over with soon? I have a book club meeting this evening, and I promised to bring the cookies.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Maribeth. No smoking or alcohol use is excellent. And don't worry, we're getting there. Now, just one final question before the exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. And I eat pretty much everything. Though I don’t care for beets, but that’s not an allergy, is it? No, I think I’m alright. No allergies. Now, shall we get on with it? I really must be going soon. This has taken quite a while.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. Alright, Maribeth. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. It won’t take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but not alarmingly so. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little faint. Your lungs sound a bit diminished on both sides, and I do notice some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Can you take a few deep breaths for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit… tight, when I breathe deeply. Like something is pressing on my chest. And yes, my ankles do feel a bit puffy. They're always worse at the end of the day. Is it something serious, Doctor? Please tell me straight. I don’t like to beat around the bush. I have things to think about, you see. And cookies to bake.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. Thank you. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam – the shortness of breath when lying flat, the diminished lung sounds, the swelling in your ankles, and the faint heart sounds – it sounds like we’re dealing with something that needs further investigation. It could be a few things. One possibility is congestive heart failure, where the heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and ankles. Another possibility is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, if you’ve had any exposure to irritants over the years, though you don't smoke, that's less likely. We also need to rule out other causes of shortness of breath. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to do a chest X-ray to see if there's any fluid in your lungs. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and look for any signs of heart damage. And finally, I’d like to order a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Oh dear. Well, I suppose there’s no avoiding it, is there? If you think it’s necessary. A chest X-ray, an EKG, and a blood test. Fine. But how long will it take? And will they be able to tell me something soon? I really need to know what's going on. And I have a book club meeting, you see. Perhaps I could schedule the tests for tomorrow morning? Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly schedule those tests for tomorrow morning. The lab is right across the street, and the radiology department is on the third floor of the building. The chest X-ray and EKG are quick and painless. The blood test will just require a small sample of blood. The results should be back within a couple of days. Once I have the results, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue propping yourself up with pillows when you lie down, and try to avoid any strenuous activity. If your breathing gets worse, or you develop chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s clear. Pillows, no strenuous activity, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. And wait for your call with the results. Tomorrow morning, then. The lab across the street, and the radiology department on the third floor. I’ve made a note of it. Well, I suppose that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. And please, do call me as soon as you have the results. I have cookies to bake, you see. .
