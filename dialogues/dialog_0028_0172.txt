DOCTOR: Right. Candice Engelhaupt. 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… a social visit, I believe. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Honestly, I don’t recall precisely why he scheduled this. Is this going to take long? I have… things.
DOCTOR: A “social visit”?
PATIENT: Yes! That's what the nice woman on the phone said. Something about… checking in. Medicare, I suppose. Honestly, paperwork these days is just dreadful. Are you going to examine me? I haven't a moment to spare for such things.
DOCTOR: Well, Medicare does cover preventative care. And, frankly, a basic check-up is standard procedure for new patients, even if your husband... insisted. It won't be extensive. Blood pressure, pulse, perhaps listen to your lungs. Just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh dear. Let me think… I used to be terribly sensitive to lilies, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I can't recall anything else. And really, must we go through all of this? My husband makes such a fuss over nothing. Is it absolutely necessary to listen to my lungs? I assure you, they are perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: It’s protocol, Ms. Engelhaupt. And frankly, “perfectly fine” is not a medical diagnosis. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious, so many questions. Let me see… my husband gives me a little pink pill every morning. For my… well, I forget what for. Something about my… waterworks, I think. And sometimes a yellow one when my joints ache. Honestly, he manages all of that. I just take them. I wouldn’t know the names if you paid me. Is this over soon?
DOCTOR: Right. “Pink pill” and “yellow pill.” Helpful. Do you have any history of serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious? Oh, you mean like… illnesses? Well, I had a touch of the flu, oh, many years ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. A very silly thing, really. My husband warned me. Honestly, I’ve always been fairly robust. It's just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. Are you a local doctor?
DOCTOR: That's...not particularly useful information, Ms. Engelhaupt. Let's try this. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… goodness. That was… a long time ago. My tonsils, when I was a girl. And… something with my… appendix, I believe. It was all very blurry. Honestly, I’ve had so much going on over the years, I can’t possibly recall all of it. This is rather… tiresome, isn’t it? Are you quite finished? I have a luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's just do a quick physical exam, then. Blood pressure, pulse, and I will listen to your lungs. Please sit back. And try to relax, Ms. Engelhaupt. It will be quicker if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must you? Honestly, I do wish your husband had explained all of this. Fine, fine. But be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated. Pulse is… irregular. And I'm hearing some… crackling in your lungs. Not alarming, but worth noting. Do you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Oh, sometimes. When I climb the stairs, perhaps. And a little… discomfort in my chest occasionally. Nothing to write home about, honestly. It’s just… old age, I suppose. Are we nearly finished? I have promised my bridge club a demonstration of my new hat. It's rather important.
DOCTOR: Right. "Old age." Very specific. Given your elevated blood pressure, irregular pulse, and the crackling in your lungs, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Just to be thorough. Also, a basic blood work panel. The lab is down the hall. You can schedule an appointment at the front desk. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. X-rays and… EKGs? Is this absolutely necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy! My husband will be furious if I’m late for bridge. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing. Is there no other way? This is terribly inconvenient, you know. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help?
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, with all due respect, I am a doctor, and I am recommending these tests for a reason. Your symptoms, however minimal you describe them, warrant further investigation. It is not about inconvenience; it is about ruling out potential problems. I strongly advise you to follow my recommendations. It would be irresponsible of me to dismiss these findings without proper investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, very well! Fine, fine. Do what you must. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And do hurry, please. My husband will be most displeased. Honestly, doctors these days… always making a fuss. .
DOCTOR: The front desk will schedule the tests. I’ll review the results when they’re available. .
