DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s…trouble going to the bathroom, mostly. I just…can’t seem to get it all out, if you know what I mean. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s startin’ to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying. And you said this has been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Maybe…a month or so? It's hard to say exactly. Time gets away from an old man, you know? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little slow. But now…now I really have to strain, and even then, it feels like there’s still some left in there. It’s uncomfortable, and…well, a little embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Hilber. These things are difficult to talk about, and it's very common. No need to be embarrassed at all. We’re here to help. So, about a month… and it’s progressing, requiring more strain to empty. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream – weaker, stronger, broken up?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. The stream…it's not as strong as it used to be, that’s for sure. Not a powerful push, like when I was younger. And sometimes it…starts and stops, you know? Like it’s breakin’ up, just like you said. I hadn't really put it together like that before, but yeah, it does that. It’s not every time, but it’s happenin’ more and more. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. You're explaining it very well. A weaker stream and intermittency…okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…well, I do get up a couple of times during the night to use the bathroom. More than I used to. And sometimes…sometimes I feel like I still have to go, even after I just went. Like there's somethin' left, even when I try to push it out. That’s probably the same thing as what I said before, though, right? I get a little mixed up sometimes. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: No, you're not mixed up at all. Those are important details. Getting up more at night – we call that nocturia – and that feeling of incomplete emptying are both relevant. Just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, pain in your lower back or abdomen, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, Doctor. My back’s been achin’ a little lately, but that’s just from bein’ old, I reckon. I do a lot of work around the house. And no, no blood in my urine that I’ve noticed. Everything looks normal when I go, if you know what I mean. Just…difficult to get it all out. It's mostly just the strainin' and the feelin' like there's still somethin' left. It's worryin' me that somethin' might be wrong, that’s for sure. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or blood. Back pain from activity…understandable. I see here you have a history of…hypertension, well-controlled. Anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the hypertension, Doctor. The doctor keeps me on pills for it, and I take ‘em regular. Other than that, nothin’ much. I used to be a fisherman, but I retired a long time ago. Been mostly stayin' home and takin' care of the place since then. I lost my wife a few years back, so it’s just me now. It gets lonely sometimes, but I manage. I try to stay active, but this…this bathroom trouble is makin’ it hard. It’s takin’ the wind outta my sails, you know?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. It’s understandable that you're feeling a bit down. And I understand how frustrating this is, making it harder to stay active. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your prostate – it's a routine part of the exam for men your age – and a quick neurological check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I figured you’d want to take a look. A prostate check, you say? I've heard stories about that one…but if that’s what you need to do, go right ahead. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on and get this sorted out, if possible. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s a standard part of the exam, and we'll make it as comfortable as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. Okay, abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, just a brief prostate exam… slight enlargement, but no obvious nodules or tenderness. Nothing acutely concerning, but the enlargement could be contributing to your symptoms. Now I'm going to do a quick neurological exam just to rule out any other causes. Please follow my finger with your eyes…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Followin’ your finger…like this? Yep, I see it. It's a little hard for an old man to move his eyes so quickly, but I'm tryin'. Is that alright? Everything feels a little…strange, but not painful. Just a little uncomfortable. Just tell me what you want me to do. I’m happy to cooperate. It’s good to know you're checkin’ everything, though. I’m a little nervous, but I’m trustin' you to figure this out. What do you think so far?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Mr. Hilber. You're doing very well. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and muscle strength is normal. Everything seems neurologically intact. Okay, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – BPH – which is an enlargement of the prostate gland. It's very common in men your age, and it can cause the difficulty emptying your bladder, frequent urination, and the feeling of incompleteness. However, to be certain and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer. We should also check your post-void residual volume, to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: BPH…that’s a mouthful. But if that’s what it is, and it’s common, that’s…reassuring, I guess. A little scary to hear it’s somethin’ wrong with my prostate, but better than somethin’ worse. Urinalysis, PSA test, and checkin’ how much is left…yes, sir, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. When will I know the results? And what happens if it is BPH? Is there anything I can do about it? I’m just tryin’ to understand what’s goin’ on and what my options are. This whole thing is makin’ me a little anxious, to be honest. I just want to get back to livin’ my life, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly normal to feel that way when facing uncertainty. The lab results should be back within a few days – usually 2-3 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. If it is BPH, there are several treatment options available. Many men start with lifestyle modifications, such as limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and bladder training exercises. We can also discuss medications to help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, or to shrink the prostate gland. In some cases, more invasive procedures like surgery might be considered, but that’s usually a last resort. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done, and then we can discuss the best course of action for you based on your individual results. I'll write you a requisition for the lab tests, and the receptionist will schedule them for you. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t think so. Just gotta go to the lab and…give ‘em a sample? Seems easy enough. And then you’ll call when the results are back and we’ll talk about what to do next? That sounds good. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. It really puts my mind at ease. I’m still a little worried, but at least I know what’s goin’ on and that there are options. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. That's what I'm here for. And yes, just a urine sample at the lab. They'll give you instructions when you get there. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber, and I’ll be in touch soon.
