DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Neeraj Auelua, it’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in… my body odor. It’s just different than it usually is, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Kerriann. These things happen, and it’s always best to get them checked out. It's good you came in. Can you tell me a bit more about this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not… worse, exactly. Just… different. Sort of… sweeter, maybe? And it seems to come and go, not constant. I usually don’t have much body odor at all, even when I’ve been working hard. I lay floors, you know? It can be dusty and sweaty work. But this is new. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? I'm pretty sure it was after a really hot spell we had.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sweeter odor that comes and goes, and started about a month ago, potentially after a hot spell. And you typically don't experience much body odor even with physical labor. That gives me a little something to work with. Just to clarify, is it localized to a specific area, like your armpits, or is it more general?
PATIENT: It’s… general, I think. Not just my armpits. I’ve noticed it… well, I noticed it on my clothes after a day of work, and just… generally, I can smell it sometimes even after a shower. It’s subtle, though. That's why it took me so long to think anything of it. I don't always smell it, and it’s not overpowering. It's just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle and general, not consistently present. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this – things like changes in your skin, any unusual sweating, or even any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Let me see… diet, not really. I eat pretty much the same as always – lots of vegetables, some chicken, injera when I can get it. Skin… no, nothing different. No rashes, no itching, no new moles or anything. Sweating… maybe a little more than usual with the heat, but nothing extreme. I mean, I do sweat when I’m laying floors, that’s unavoidable! But not more than you’d expect. I haven’t felt unusually hot or cold, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant changes in diet, skin, or overall temperature regulation. And you haven't noticed any new rashes or itching. Okay. Just to cover some basics, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a serious allergic reaction. I can eat pretty much anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. No regular medications. And I’m up to date on my tetanus shot, I make sure of that with the work I do. Lots of chances to get cut and scraped, you know?
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful. No known allergies and up-to-date on your tetanus. And just to be thorough, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe… twenty years ago? But I recovered fully. And I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I see the dentist regularly, and get my checkups. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I've always been pretty active, even with the physical demands of the job. I try to stay in good shape. Oh, and I was divorced about five years ago. If that matters?
DOCTOR: No, your personal life doesn’t matter, Kerriann, just checking for anything that might be relevant medically. Pneumonia in the past and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. And you’ve been generally healthy since then. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his heart when he was older. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major, really. Nobody in my family has ever had anything… unusual. No cancers, no genetic conditions… just the usual things that come with getting older. It’s a pretty small family, actually. Just me and my sister, and our parents are both gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hypertension in your mother and heart problems in your father. Thanks for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink alcohol, either. Never really liked it. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I need a clear head for my work, you know? It's important to be focused when you're handling tools and things. It's dangerous work if you're not paying attention. So, no, I keep pretty clean in that regard. Just tea and coffee to get me through the day!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Just tea and coffee. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! Sometimes, when I’m really tired, I get a sort of… metallic taste in my mouth. It doesn't last long, and it’s not a constant thing. But I do remember reading something about that being a symptom of something or other, a long time ago. I don't know if it's related to the body odor, though. And, like I said, I’m divorced. I’ve been single for five years now, if that matters at all. It's just… been a stressful time, sometimes. But I try to stay positive.
DOCTOR: Okay, a metallic taste in your mouth when tired and a recent divorce which has been stressful. We can certainly explore the possibility of stress playing a role. It’s good you're trying to stay positive. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. Then I’ll check your lymph nodes and have a quick look at your skin. It's a standard exam, nothing to worry about. Could you please sit up and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound good, and your ears look clear. I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes. Your skin looks generally healthy as well. I don’t see any rashes or unusual marks. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid gland. It feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal any obvious cause for the change in body odor.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, what does that mean? What could be causing it, if it’s not anything obvious? I'm starting to get a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kerriann. It's good we’ve ruled out some of the more obvious causes. The fact that the physical exam is normal is reassuring, but it doesn't give us a definitive answer. There are a few possibilities we should consider. Sometimes, changes in body odor can be caused by changes in diet, even subtle ones, or even by certain medications, though you said you're not taking any. Hormonal changes can also play a role, even after a hysterectomy, though it's less common. Less commonly, it can be related to metabolic changes, or even stress, as you mentioned. The metallic taste you experience when tired could be related, but it's difficult to say for sure. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels, and a general metabolic panel. It will also rule out any underlying infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests sound sensible. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Something being different. And I'm worried it's something serious. So, yes, please, let’s do the blood tests. Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kerriann. It’s always unsettling when something changes. And it’s good we’re being proactive. I'm going to give you a lab requisition here. You can go to [Name of Local Lab], they’re located at [Address of Local Lab]. You don’t need an appointment. Just take this form with you, and they'll take care of it. The results usually come back within 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and we can decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms - fever, weight loss, excessive sweating, or any new rashes – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds clear. So, just go to the lab, and then you'll call me when the results are back. Thank you, Dr. Auelua. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as nothing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. It's always best to investigate these things, even if they seem minor. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
