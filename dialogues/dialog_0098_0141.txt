DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. It’s…well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terribly painful, just…constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching for a couple of weeks…and it’s widespread, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, widespread. Arms, legs, back…even my scalp. I haven't noticed any bumps or anything, just…redness sometimes, and the itch. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, exactly, but it's not going away either. I tried some lotion, but that didn't do much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned it's been a couple of weeks…has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. I've been keeping to my routine, mostly. Same foods, same laundry detergent…oh! Wait a minute. About three weeks ago, maybe a little more, I started using a new bar of soap. A fancy one, actually. My niece brought it back from a trip. Smelled nice, lavender or something. Could that be it? I hadn’t really thought about it until just now.
DOCTOR: That’s very possible. New soaps can sometimes cause a reaction. Do you recall the name of the soap?
PATIENT: You know, I don't. She just gave it to me as a gift. It was wrapped nicely, a purple paper, I think. It was a smaller bar, not one of those big ones. I think it had flowers on the packaging…lavender and something else, maybe chamomile. She said it was made with natural oils. I’m terrible with names, I’m afraid. I just used it because it smelled good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a smaller bar, purple packaging, lavender and chamomile…natural oils. Alright. And besides the itching, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no fatigue…nothing like that. Just the itch. It’s…distracting, that’s all. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. And, well, it’s embarrassing. I find myself…scratching a lot. I haven’t really left the house much because of it, to be honest. I’m a bit of a homebody anyway, but…this makes it worse.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve had a few mosquito bites in my life, of course, but nothing serious. My wife…God rest her soul…she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust…she had to be careful in the spring. I just always figured I was lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribed for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, been on it for years. Other than that, nothing. Vitamins occasionally, but nothing regular. I try to eat healthy, you know? Keeps the doctor away, or so they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to take a look at your skin and see if we can get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. I just want to get this itch sorted out. It’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just get comfortable up there, and we’ll take a look. I'm going to start by just visually inspecting your skin, and then I’ll palpate a few areas. I’m noting some mild redness on your forearms and legs, but no obvious rash or bumps. The skin feels generally warm and dry. No significant tenderness. Scalp looks normal. I don’t see any signs of anything alarming, but we still need to consider a few possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear it’s not…alarming. I was worried it might be something serious. I just feel…uncomfortable, you know? A constant tingling, really. Like tiny ants crawling on me. Is that…common with allergies? I've never had one before, so I don't really know what to expect. It's just…annoying. And distracting. I find it hard to read, even watch TV. I just want to get back to my routine, but this itch won't let me.
DOCTOR: That tingling sensation is definitely something to note. It could be consistent with a mild allergic reaction, or it could be something else. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes. It will also give us a baseline in case the itching worsens. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. A blood test is no trouble at all. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then absolutely. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I just want this to be over with, honestly. It's been a while since I've felt this…uncomfortable. And I miss my reading.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll need a sample of your blood. It's a quick procedure, shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend stopping the use of that new soap immediately. And, while we wait for the results, let's try an over-the-counter antihistamine like cetirizine. It may help relieve some of the itching. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Stop the soap, take the antihistamine… I can do that. Cetirizine… I think I’ve heard of it. I’ll go to the lab right away, then. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. Just knowing we’re looking into it helps. I appreciate your time and attention. I’ll go do that now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. That’s what I’m here for. Please, let the lab know I’ve ordered a complete blood count. And don’t hesitate to call the office if the itching worsens or you experience any other symptoms. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and give you a call with the findings. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes.
