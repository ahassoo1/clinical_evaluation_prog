DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s…family, mostly. My mother, she…had a lot of health problems. And her mother before her. It’s just…a lot of worrying, you know? I want to make sure I don’t end up the same way. I guess I just want to be told everything’s okay. Or, if it’s not okay, what I should be doing about it. I’m an engineering teacher, so…I like to understand things, have a plan.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re coming in for a general health assessment, largely driven by family history and a desire for preventative care. That’s…sensible, I suppose. Though frankly, worrying about things before they happen isn't terribly productive. Still. Let’s get some details then, shall we?
PATIENT: Productive or not, it helps me sleep at night. And honestly, some of the things my mother went through…you wouldn’t wish it on anyone. It wasn’t just a cold, you know? It was…complicated. A lot of specialists, a lot of tests…I just don't want to end up like that. So, yes, details. What kind of details do you need? I brought a list, if that helps. It’s mostly what I remember her telling me, and what I could dig up from old medical records.
DOCTOR: Old medical records are…often incomplete, unfortunately. Still, better than nothing. Let's start with your mother then. What were the main problems she experienced?
PATIENT: Well, she had…diabetes, I think. Type 2, definitely. She was always tired, and thirsty. Then her feet…they were awful. She ended up needing…procedures. I don’t even want to think about it. And before that, her heart. Something about…high blood pressure, and irregular rhythms. She was on a lot of medication, always complaining about feeling weak. It was…a whole thing. And my grandmother, on her side…she had something similar, I think. It was a long time ago, so the details are fuzzy. Mostly just heart problems, as I recall. She didn’t take care of herself, though. Smoking, drinking…that sort of thing. My mother tried to be healthier, but…it didn’t seem to help much in the end.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a family history of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Not ideal. And a predilection for unhealthy habits, it seems. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had a few check-ups over the years, routine stuff, but nothing ever came up. I try to eat reasonably well. Lots of vegetables, lean protein. I don’t really drink, and I’ve never smoked. I do get stressed, though. Teaching can be…demanding. And I don't always get enough sleep. But I wouldn't say I have unhealthy habits. My ex-wife would probably disagree, but…she always exaggerated. Honestly, I think she just liked to complain. It’s probably best not to dwell on that, though. So, no diabetes. At least, not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your own medical history, then. Any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing cricket. Had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox, all that. But nothing since. No surgeries, no chronic conditions. I’ve had the flu a few times, a bad cold here and there, but nothing that required a hospital visit. I’m generally a healthy person, or at least, I was. That's what’s so worrying, you know? Everything’s been fine, and now I’m just…anticipating problems. It’s not a very rational way to live, I suppose. But I can’t help but worry, given my family history.
DOCTOR: Anticipating problems is rarely helpful. Though, a clear medical history, or lack thereof, is a good starting point. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, painkillers for headaches, that sort of thing. Nothing ever caused a reaction. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to penicillin, I remember asking about that once. But honestly, I haven't really paid much attention. I just take what the doctor prescribes and hope for the best. It's not ideal, I suppose. But I've never had any problems, so I haven't really seen the need to be overly cautious. I’m not the type to go digging for information unless there’s a reason to.
DOCTOR: Remarkable. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I pride myself on not needing medication. Some of my colleagues are constantly popping pills for everything and anything. I think it’s…weak. Not that I’m judging, of course. Everyone’s different. But I like to think I can manage things on my own. Stress relief, healthy diet, enough sleep…that sort of thing. That’s my approach. So no, absolutely no medication. I haven’t had a reason to take any, thankfully. And I hope I never do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I suppose I should have expected that. Do you need me to…change into one of those paper gowns? I'm not particularly fond of those. They're rather…revealing. And cold.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. Just your blood pressure and a listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a quick look at your feet, given your mother’s history. Please, just sit back and relax. Now, try to breathe normally…
PATIENT: Okay. Breathing normally. This is…slightly stressful, actually. I don’t usually get anxious at the doctor’s, but the whole family history thing is really getting to me. I keep imagining the worst. Is my blood pressure supposed to be…high right now? I always forget what the numbers mean.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 135/85. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pulses are present and normal. Skin is intact, no signs of sores or infection. Although, your feet are a little…cold. And dry. Do you moisturize them regularly?
PATIENT: Moisturize? No, not really. I mean, I wash them when I shower, of course. But I don't go in for all that lotion and cream stuff. It seems…frivolous. My ex-wife was always slathering herself in lotions, but I never understood the appeal. And cold feet…that’s just how I am. I've always had cold feet. Is that a problem? It’s probably just circulation. I sit at a desk all day, you know? It can’t be good for the blood flow. Honestly, I’m starting to worry more now than I was before. This isn’t reassuring at all.
DOCTOR: It's not a definitive diagnosis, Mr. Theriot, but given your family history, slightly elevated blood pressure, and cold feet, we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood work: a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and HbA1c to check your blood sugar levels. We should also do a urine analysis. It's standard procedure, don't be alarmed. And I strongly advise you to start moisturizing your feet daily. And consider a low-sodium diet, and regular exercise. These aren’t suggestions, they're precautions. We need to be proactive. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Proactive. Yes, I understand. Though, I still think you’re overreacting slightly. It’s just a few elevated numbers, and some cold feet. But…fine. Blood work, urine analysis, moisturizing, diet, exercise. It sounds…excessive. But if it will put your mind at ease…I’ll do it. When do you want me to get these tests done? And do you have a preferred lab? Honestly, this is just going to be a hassle. I have a lot of lesson planning to do. But I suppose I have no choice, if you insist. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll get it over with.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 3. The nurse will give you the requisitions. As for the hassle, Mr. Theriot, preventative care is rarely convenient. But it's significantly less inconvenient than managing a chronic illness. Now, I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. We'll discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet, or any chest pain, contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Numbness, tingling, chest pain…lovely. No, I don’t think so. Just…get it done. Room 3, requisitions, results, follow-up. I think I’ve got it. Honestly, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. But I appreciate you…taking the time, I suppose. I’ll go find room 3. And I’ll try to remember to buy some lotion. Though, I can’t promise I’ll actually use it. .
