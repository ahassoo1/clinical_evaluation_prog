DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It's… well, it's my stomach. It just won't stop. I've been dealing with this diarrhea for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the pharmacy suggested, and honestly, I'm starting to get really frustrated. I need this fixed, and I need to know why it's not getting better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration; chronic diarrhea can be quite disruptive. We will certainly investigate the cause and find a solution. “Weeks” is a significant duration. Could you elaborate on that timeframe?
PATIENT: Honestly? I stopped keeping track after the first week. It's been... at least a month, probably longer. It started subtly, you know? Just a little off. Then it got worse and worse. And it’s not just inconvenient, it’s… embarrassing. And weak. I'm losing weight. Look, I just want to know if there's something seriously wrong, or if I just need to try something else. I really don't have time for a long drawn-out process.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month of persistent diarrhea warrants a thorough evaluation, and your weight loss is concerning. Let's gather some more details to understand what might be going on. To start, can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, you want me to describe it? Really? Fine. It's… watery. Lots of it. Sometimes there’s… well, you don’t need details. It's just… not normal. And it happens multiple times a day. Like, five, six times easily. Sometimes more if I eat anything. Honestly, I’m barely eating anything at this point, and it still happens. It’s exhausting. And cramping. Bad cramping. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, that is very helpful. The frequency and association with eating, along with the cramping, are important details. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Not that I've seen. Mucus… maybe a little sometimes? It's hard to tell, honestly. I don't spend a lot of time examining my… well, you know. It's just… stuff. Look, I'm a painter, I’m busy. I don’t have time to be analyzing my bathroom habits. Is this getting us somewhere or am I wasting my time?
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Woodring, and we are certainly making progress. The absence of blood is good, but the occasional mucus is noted. Now, let’s briefly explore some other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain in addition to the cramping?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Nausea, sometimes, just a little queasy, but nothing major. The pain is mostly just the cramping, it comes and goes. It’s not… like a sharp pain, more like a really uncomfortable squeezing. Honestly, the worst part is just the weakness from… everything. And the constant running to the bathroom. It's humiliating, frankly. I feel awful, and I just want it to stop. Is there anything you can actually do about this?
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Ms. Woodring. We will work to determine the cause and find relief. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I was healthy. Always active. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My husband… he took care of all the doctor stuff. He passed away a few years back, and… I haven’t really needed a doctor since then. No allergies that I know of. No chronic conditions. I’m not on any medications. Really, I'm a perfectly healthy person who can't stop going to the bathroom. It doesn't make any sense.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Woodring. It sounds as though you’ve been quite healthy up until recently, which is helpful information. Now, let's explore your family history. Are there any gastrointestinal issues – such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Look, my family history is… complicated. Lots of people, spread all over. My mother’s side had… something. Stomach problems, maybe? I don’t really know. Nobody talked about it much. My father’s side was… mostly fishermen, hardy types. They didn't go to doctors. They just… dealt with things. I honestly can’t tell you if anyone had any specific illnesses. We weren’t really a family that kept track of that sort of thing. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing for something.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if the questioning feels intrusive. Family history can be helpful, but it’s certainly not always clear. Let’s move on. Could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: My diet? It's… minimal, lately. Like I said, anything I eat seems to make it worse. I used to eat pretty healthy, lots of fish, vegetables, berries… the usual. Now, it's mostly toast and crackers. Bland things. I’ve been trying to stick to things that won’t upset my stomach. I drink a lot of water, obviously. I don't drink alcohol, never really liked it. And I don't eat a lot of processed foods. Honestly, I'm just trying to survive at this point. I'm losing weight, and I need to get this under control. Is there a test you can just do to figure out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick answer, Ms. Woodring. Several tests can help, and we will order some. Before we do that, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you travel frequently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Not really. I haven't left Alaska in… well, years. I used to, with my husband, but… that was a long time ago. I mostly stay around here, working. I don't go to fancy restaurants or anything. I'm a painter, remember? I spend most of my time on ladders and in dusty buildings. No exotic foods, no questionable water, no anything that would cause… this. Honestly, I'm starting to get really annoyed. Are you even listening to me? It feels like you're just going through a checklist.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Woodring. You are absolutely right to call me out. I am listening, and I should be better at conveying that. I am reviewing these details to rule out various possibilities. It’s important to be thorough. Given your history and symptoms, I'd like to order some tests to help determine the cause of your diarrhea. We'll start with a stool sample to check for infection, and a blood test to look for inflammation and rule out any deficiencies. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that sounds… good. Anything to get this figured out. Just tell me what I need to do. I've got work to get back to, and I can’t spend all day in here. Where do I go, what do I do? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I understand your need to return to work. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. The technician will provide you with instructions for collecting the stool sample. It’s best to collect the sample as soon as possible, and you'll need to bring it in within 24 hours. The blood test can be done right here in the examination room, and will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. We will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated and try to eat bland foods as tolerated. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I've wasted enough time already. Thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration. I will have a nurse come in to draw your blood, and then direct you to the lab for the stool sample. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
