DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually – and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor before I can go. Just a standard thing, I believe. They sent me a form.
DOCTOR: A standard form, you say. Right. Well, let’s get that taken care of then. Cruise lines can be…particular. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, they certainly can be! Very particular indeed. Well, as for my health… I’m generally quite fit for my age, I think. I don’t get sick often. A wee cold now and then, perhaps, but nothing serious. I walk every day, and I try to eat a good diet. I lost my husband a few years back, and keeping busy helps, you see. He always said I needed to be on the go.
DOCTOR: I see. Losing a spouse is…difficult. Keeping active is a good coping mechanism, certainly. However, “generally fit” isn’t quite specific enough for medical clearance. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You’re quite right to ask. Let me think… Well, my ankles have been a bit troublesome lately. They swell up if I’m on my feet for too long. It’s not painful, usually, just…uncomfortable. And the doctor back home – Dr. MacIntyre – he said something about my blood pressure being a little high, but he didn’t prescribe anything for it. He just said to watch my salt intake. Is that what you mean by “current”?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s relevant. Swollen ankles and elevated blood pressure are both things we need to address. Now, when you say “a little high,” do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don't have the exact numbers, I’m afraid. Dr. MacIntyre just told me it was a bit up, and that I should be mindful. I saw him last… let me think… it must have been March, I believe. He did a full check-up then, and everything else was fine. He always said I was a very healthy woman, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me pull up your record. You said Dr. MacIntyre was your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Dr. Alistair MacIntyre. He’s been my doctor since my husband… well, for a very long time. A very good man. His office is in Inverness, if that helps. I’m not sure if you have a system that shares records, but I wouldn’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, our system doesn't interface with practices in Inverness. We’re…limited in that regard. So, we’ll have to rely on your recollection and a current assessment. Let’s start with your ankles. When did you first notice them swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a shame about the records. Never mind, though. I’ll do my best to recall everything. As for my ankles… I’d say it started about six months ago, perhaps. It wasn’t sudden, just a gradual thing. I noticed my shoes felt a bit tighter, and then I realised it was my ankles. It’s worse in the evenings, after I’ve been on my feet all day. And it’s especially bad if it’s warm, you see.
DOCTOR: And does anything relieve the swelling?
PATIENT: Well, putting my feet up helps a great deal. A good, long rest with my feet elevated. And cool water, I find. A cool compress. It doesn't make it disappear completely, mind you, but it certainly eases the discomfort. I also try to wear comfortable shoes, even though I do like a nice heel now and then.
DOCTOR: Comfortable shoes are advisable. Now, let’s discuss your blood pressure. Dr. MacIntyre mentioned “a little high.” Have you ever experienced any symptoms related to high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, let me think... Not that I recall, no. I haven’t had any headaches or dizziness or anything like that. I feel quite well, generally. Perhaps a bit tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, I suppose. I don’t get nosebleeds or anything worrying like that. I’ve never been one for worrying, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to take your blood pressure now, Ms. Squiers. And I’d also like to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your ankles. It’s standard procedure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you need. It's reassuring to know you're being thorough. Please, go ahead. I'll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated – 150/92. Your heart sounds regular, but I did detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Your ankles exhibit moderate pitting edema bilaterally. This confirms my initial assessment. Given your history and the current findings, I recommend a cardiology consultation. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues before you embark on this cruise.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? A cardiology consultation? I hadn’t anticipated that. Is it… is it something to be worried about, Doctor? I feel perfectly well, you see. Perhaps it’s just my age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: "Catching up with you" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Squiers. While you feel well, the objective findings – elevated blood pressure, a heart murmur, and ankle swelling – indicate a potential problem that requires investigation. A cardiology consultation doesn't necessarily mean you have a serious condition, but it is prudent to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. The cruise line will likely require it regardless. I'm going to order some blood work to assess your kidney function and rule out other potential causes for the swelling. We also need an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. You’re quite right, of course. I shouldn’t dismiss it just because I feel alright. It’s just… I was so looking forward to this cruise. I’ve been saving for it for years. Blood work and an EKG, you say. Will that take long? And… will it prevent me from going on the cruise? I understand it’s for the best, but… it’s a bit disappointing.
DOCTOR: The blood work and EKG can be done here today. The results typically take 24-48 hours. As for preventing you from going on the cruise… that depends on the findings. If everything is normal, you should be cleared. If there are any concerns, we’ll discuss your options. The cardiology consultation will provide a more definitive assessment. I am obligated to prioritize your health and safety, Ms. Squiers. I understand your disappointment, but it's essential to address these concerns before you travel. I will write the orders for the lab work and EKG now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the test. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You’re absolutely right to prioritize my health. I wouldn’t want to put myself – or anyone else – at risk. No allergies, thankfully. Not to anything, as far as I know. I’ve always been quite robust, actually. And I do appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It does put my mind at ease, even if it’s a bit… worrisome.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll also write a note for the cruise line outlining the tests we are performing and our rationale. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your legs, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very helpful and reassuring. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I'll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
