DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, let me tell ya. Happened a couple times now. Thought it was just somethin' I ate, but it keeps comin' back. Don't have the money for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, bleedin’. Like I said. Not a little sniffle, bleedin’. You know, from… down there. Honestly, I don’t need a lecture on what bleedin’ is. I see it, alright? And it ain't gettin’ better. It's… dark. Real dark. And kinda smells… well, you get the picture. Is this gonna cost me a fortune? Because I lost pretty much everything when my wife… never mind. Just tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gentz, I understand you're concerned, and frankly, a bit agitated. Dark stool is… not ideal. We need to figure out what's causing it. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I feel tired. Real tired. And weak. Been eatin' less 'cause I don't want to… you know. Make things worse. And I get dizzy sometimes, standin' up too fast. Is that a symptom? Everything just feels… off. Like somethin' is drainin' the life outta me. But honestly, doc, bein' bleedin' kinda overshadows everything else, don’t you think? It’s not exactly a subtle problem.
DOCTOR: Tired, weak, dizzy… alright. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not like this. I've had a stomach ache here and there, like anyone, but never… this. Never bleedin'. And I definitely haven't felt this weak before. Used to be able to lift… well, never mind. That was a long time ago. This is new. And it’s worryin' me, doc. Real worryin'. I just want to know what's goin' on and how much it's gonna cost me to fix it. I ain't got a lot of money, and I don't have insurance, so…
DOCTOR: Alright, look. We need to do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? You gonna poke around in there? Honestly, doc, I’m not thrilled about that. Is it necessary? Can’t you just… give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’? I've seen enough doctors in my life to know they love their exams. And they always seem to find somethin’ wrong, even when I feel fine. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do, you know. Though, what those things are anymore… I don’t even remember. But still. An exam?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I need to assess the situation. Palpate your abdomen, listen to your bowel sounds, check your vitals. It's standard procedure. Without it, I'm just guessing. And guessing doesn't help anyone. It'll be quick. Five minutes, tops.
PATIENT: Five minutes, huh? Fine. Five minutes. But if you start askin’ me to… well, you know. I’m walkin’ out. I ain’t payin’ for nothin’ fancy. Just tell me if it’s serious and what the bill’s gonna be. And no lectures, alright? I’ve had a long day. And a long life, for that matter. Just get it over with. But I’m warnin’ ya, I bruise easy. My wife used to say… never mind. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect much. I haven't eaten much lately, so it's probably just an empty stomach rumblin'. And it's cold in here. Really cold. You wouldn’t happen to have a blanket, would ya? No, never mind. Don’t bother. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is… tender. And I hear some… decreased bowel sounds. Your heart rate is also a little elevated. What about any family history of stomach problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, jeez. My family… well, they mostly just drank a lot of tea and complained about the weather. My grandfather had ulcers, I think. But that was a long time ago. And he smoked like a chimney, so who knows what that was. My wife's side… they mostly kept to themselves. Didn't talk about much of anything, honestly. So, no, I don't really have a good answer for ya. Look, is this serious? That’s what I want to know. Am I gonna die? Because I really don't have the energy for a whole lot of drama right now.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gentz, I'm not going to tell you you're going to die. But you're presenting with symptoms that require further investigation. The dark stool, the weakness, the tenderness… it could be a number of things. We need to run some tests. A CBC to check your blood count, and a stool sample to look for blood.
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? What's a CBC? And a… stool sample? You want me to… give you a sample? Honestly, doc, this is gettin’ ridiculous. Can’t you just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’? Like, some kinda pill or somethin’? I really don’t want to mess around with samples and counts and… all this stuff. How much is this gonna cost me? I'm tellin' ya, I ain't made of money. And I'm feelin' weaker by the minute. I think I'm gonna need to sit down. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gentz, a CBC is a blood test. It tells us if you’re anemic. And yes, we need a stool sample. It's standard protocol. As for a pill… I can't just prescribe something without knowing why you're bleeding. It could be a simple ulcer, or something more serious. The tests will tell us. The CBC is about $50, and the stool sample… maybe $20. But if it's something serious, we’re lookin’ at an endoscopy. That's going to be expensive. Very expensive.
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What’s an endoscopy? Is that where you… stick a camera down my throat? Oh, for the love of… I knew it. It’s always somethin’. Seriously, doc, I can barely afford to eat, let alone stick cameras down my throat. And what if it’s… bad? What if it’s somethin’ really, really bad? I lost my wife last year… I don’t have anyone to… look, I just want this to stop. I just want to feel normal again. How much would an endoscopy even cost? Give me a number. A real number. Before I faint. Because I swear, I’m feelin’ faint.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy… without insurance, it's around $1500. Maybe more, depending on what they find. Look, Mr. Gentz, I understand this is a lot. But we need to rule things out. I can give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They might be able to work with you on a payment plan. But first, we need those tests. CBC and stool sample. And then, if necessary, the endoscopy. Otherwise, I'm just… guessing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fifteen hundred dollars? For a camera down my throat? I… I don’t have fifteen hundred dollars. I don’t even have a thousand dollars. I got… a couple hundred. Maybe. After I pay the rent. And the electric bill. I… I guess I need to think about it. I need to go home. I’m feelin’ really sick. And really overwhelmed. Can I just… can I just get a piece of paper with the instructions for the stool sample? And maybe the phone number for that… that gut doctor? I need to sit down. And think. And figure out how to sell a kidney. .
