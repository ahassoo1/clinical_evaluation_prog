DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. It's this fever, keeps comin' back. It's a bother, really. Feels like I’m gettin’ somethin’, then it breaks, then it's back a few days later. Been happenin' for… well, I dunno exactly how long, a couple weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, a couple of weeks of a recurring fever. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts with chills, even when it's warm out. Then I get real tired, achy, you know, like the flu. The temperature… I checked it a couple times, went up to 101, maybe 102. Not sky-high, but enough to knock me down a bit. Then it goes away for a day or two, and I feel alright, then bam, it's back. It's just…regular. Not getting worse, not getting better. Just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills, body aches, temperature peaking around 101-102, then it resolves for a bit, and then returns. That fluctuating pattern is good to know. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the fever when it comes back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no sniffles. No stomach trouble, thankfully. I've been a little… sweaty, when it’s at its worst. And kinda… weak. Like I used to be able to do stuff around the house, but now I gotta take breaks. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major, just… not myself. My wife keeps tellin' me to come in, says I look peaked. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Clide. No cough, no gastrointestinal issues, just the sweats and the weakness. And it sounds like it's affecting your energy levels. Before we move on, let’s just quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. I've been pretty lucky, always been healthy. A little arthritis in my hands, gettin' old, ya know? But that’s about it. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems, nothin'. I used to go to a doctor regularly, but… well, things got tight, ya know? Insurance is expensive, and I felt alright, so I just…stopped. My wife keeps tellin' me that was a mistake, too. She's usually right, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy with some arthritis in your hands. And you haven't been to a doctor regularly for a while. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. No surgeries either. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Nothing else. Always been able to avoid that stuff. I’ve always been careful. My wife had her gallbladder out a few years back, but that’s her story, not mine.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Clide. And no family history of any serious illnesses that run in the family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some heart trouble when she got older, but she lived to be 85, so it wasn’t too bad. And my father, he had… I forget exactly, somethin’ with his kidneys. But nobody really got sick with anything serious, ya know? Just the usual old age stuff. It's probably nothin'. I just wanna get this fever sorted out, it’s wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some heart trouble in your mother and kidney issues in your father, but generally a healthy family history. And you’ve never had any allergies to medications, correct?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to anythin’. I can take most stuff, I think. Penicillin, aspirin… never had a problem. My wife's allergic to bee stings, gotta carry an EpiPen for her, but I’m fine. I really don't take much medicine to begin with, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a thing. Just… nothin’. I took some Tylenol for the fever a couple times, but that just takes the edge off. It doesn’t fix it, ya know? Doesn’t make it go away. My wife keeps offerin’ me all sorts of stuff, but I don’t like takin’ pills if I don’t have to. I prefer to just ride it out, usually. But this one’s stickin’ around.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. So, to recap: you're a 65-year-old male, generally healthy with some arthritis, no known allergies, and not currently taking any medications. You’ve had a recurring fever for about two weeks, peaking around 101-102, accompanied by chills, body aches, and weakness. It resolves for a short period, then returns. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doc. Go ahead. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on. Been feelin' kinda run down and tired. The sooner we get it sorted, the better. Just…try not to take too long, alright? I got things to do. Not important things, but things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. I understand. I’m not detecting anything immediately alarming, but the recurring fever and the weakness are concerning. Given the pattern and the fact that it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, I think we should run some basic blood work to rule out any infections or underlying inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doc. I don’t like needles, but I guess I gotta do what I gotta do. Just… tell me what it is, ya know? Don't wanna be surprised by a big bill. And… where do we go from there?
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. I understand your concern. We'll start with a Complete Blood Count to check for signs of infection or anemia, a Basic Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate to look for inflammation. These are pretty standard tests. We’ll also check a thyroid-stimulating hormone to rule out thyroid issues, as those can sometimes cause similar symptoms. The cost will be… around $150-200, depending on the lab, but we can discuss options if that's a concern. I’ll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we'll review them together and determine the next steps. It might be nothing, but it's best to rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $150-200… hmm. That’s… not ideal, but I guess I gotta know what’s goin’ on. Fine, do it. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t wanna be waitin’ around for weeks. My wife will have a fit if I'm runnin' back and forth to the doctor all the time. Write the order, let's get it over with. I got stuff to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. I understand your frustration. I’ll write the order now. The lab usually gets the results back within 24-48 hours, and my office will contact you as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. Here you go. Take this to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll take it from there. If you have any questions, feel free to call the office. And, just to be on the safe side, if your fever spikes significantly – over 103 – or you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Over 103… okay. I’ll remember that. No, I think that’s it, Doc. Just get these results back as fast as possible. I appreciate you not makin’ me wait a month. Tell them to hurry, alright? Thanks, Doc. I guess I'll see you when they call. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. We'll do our best to get them back to you quickly. You take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
