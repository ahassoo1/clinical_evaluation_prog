DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, so what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Todoro…vich, is it? Honestly, it’s rather… taxing. This job. It’s simply exhausting. All these… young people. No respect for knowledge, you understand. It’s a… a weight. I believe it’s a weight. I’d like to be finished with this as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. A weight… I see. So, this “weight” is… physical?
PATIENT: Physical? Good heavens, no. Though, my back does ache, but that’s from… well, it’s not important. It’s… a mental strain. A burden. These students… they don’t appreciate a good Dewey Decimal System anymore, you see? It's… demoralizing. Really. I can't quite explain it. It just is.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you’re experiencing… stress, related to your work. And some back discomfort. Let's try to clarify the stress first. When did you start feeling this… demoralization, as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult to say. Years, I suppose. Decades, even. It's a gradual thing, you understand. It wasn’t a single moment. Just… a slow decline in the standards of… everything. Truly. I don’t keep track of these things. Dates are unimportant. It’s just… always been this way, more or less.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "always" isn't particularly helpful for a medical assessment, Mr. Schlatterer. Has anything changed recently that’s made it worse?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me see… There was that new… computer system they installed. Utterly useless. Complicated things needlessly. And… a new student assistant, quite impertinent, if I recall. But honestly, Doctor, it all blends together. It’s simply a constant… annoyance. I fail to see how any of this relates to my… condition. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Schlatterer. The computer system and the student assistant… those sound like potential stressors. Do either of those specifically cause you to feel… anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Anxious? Irritable? Oh, heavens, no. I’m a professional, Doctor. I don't get anxious. Though, I may have raised my voice… once or twice. Regarding the proper filing of periodicals. It’s a matter of principle! Really, it’s just… frustrating, dealing with incompetence. And I simply don't have the time for these… emotional inquiries. Can we perhaps focus on a solution? A… a prescription, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I need a bit more information to determine the best course of action. We’re not here for a quick fix. Before we even consider medication, I need to understand what you’re experiencing physically. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well… I sleep. When I’m tired. Doctor, with all due respect, are you quite certain you’re a physician? This feels like a… a personal interrogation. I simply want something to… calm my nerves, if that’s possible. I do not discuss my sleep patterns with strangers. It’s… private. Really, this is rather unproductive. I think I’d like a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand you're not comfortable discussing this further. However, without a proper assessment, I cannot ethically prescribe anything. I will document your request for a second opinion. Perhaps a visit with a mental health professional would be more beneficial, given your concerns. I can provide a referral if you wish. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A mental health professional? Preposterous! I assure you, Doctor, my mind is perfectly sound. It's everyone else who is… lacking. No, thank you. I simply wanted a simple remedy for… this. This… situation. I believe I’ll consult with my GP. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Schlatterer.
