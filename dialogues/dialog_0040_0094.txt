DOCTOR: Right. Airam Fontanazza, 33. Okay, well, don't waste my time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... the lady on the phone said... something about learning? I don't... really remember. My husband told me to come. He said it was important. It's... about staying healthy, I think? I work with metal all day, it's dirty work.
DOCTOR: "Learning" is a bit vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: Vague? Yes, very vague. Like I said, I don't... remember what I'm learning about. They just said "education." Is it about my hands? They get cuts all the time. Little ones, mostly. I wrap them, but... they keep happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Cuts. Well, people work with metal, they get cuts. It's hardly a medical emergency. Still, let's get this over with. How long have you been doing this metal work?
PATIENT: Um... a long time. Maybe... seven years? Eight? I lost track. Since we moved here, definitely. It pays the bills. My husband, he does... paperwork. It's boring, but steady. Is this going to take long? I have dinner to make.
DOCTOR: Seven or eight years… paperwork, alright. And these cuts, are they all on your hands?
PATIENT: Mostly. Sometimes on my arms, if something slips. They don't... bleed much. Just little scratches, usually. I clean them with soap and water, put a bandage on. It's… what you do. My mother always said a little dirt builds character, but… maybe she was wrong. It's just... I want to make sure everything is okay. My husband worries.
DOCTOR: “Builds character.” Honestly. Alright, let’s have a look then. Wash your hands again, thoroughly, and then come back. I need to see these cuts. And be quick about it.
PATIENT: Fine. Soap and water… like I haven't been doing that for years. Honestly. Some doctors… they think everyone is stupid.
DOCTOR: Honestly. This is a waste of perfectly good time.
PATIENT: There. Happy? Now can we get this over with? I really need to go. My husband doesn’t like it when dinner is late. It’s just… this. All the time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well, as expected. A few superficial abrasions, some old scarring. Nothing life-threatening. You're up to date on your tetanus shot, I presume?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? I... I don't know. I think so? I had a shot… a long time ago. When I was… a kid, maybe? My husband usually takes care of all that stuff. He's very organized. Does it matter? They don’t look bad.
DOCTOR: "They don't look bad." That's hardly a medical assessment. Alright, look, I'm going to order a tetanus booster, just to be safe. And I’m going to recommend you see someone about proper wound care. Band-aids aren't a solution, you know. There. Done. Next. Pharmacy’s down the street. Don’t bother calling with questions.
PATIENT: A booster…? And see someone? Like… a specialist? This is ridiculous. I just wanted to learn about… staying healthy. Not get poked with needles and sent on wild goose chases. Honestly, some doctors… Fine. Whatever. I’ll tell my husband. He can deal with it. .
DOCTOR: Good day. And try to be more careful. .
