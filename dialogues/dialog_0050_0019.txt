DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Manuel. Hmm… what brings me? My wife… she wants… babies. We want babies. But… we are older, yes? She says maybe… planning is good. I forget things, so… she thought a doctor visit would help. Is that right? I think so.
DOCTOR: "Babies," you say. Well, Manuel, that is… ambitious, given your age and, as you mentioned, some memory concerns. It's commendable that you and your wife are considering this thoughtfully. However, let's be precise. When your wife says “planning,” what specifically does she have in mind?
PATIENT: Planning… she talks about… making sure everything is okay before. Before trying. She says… tests? To see if we… are strong enough? I don't know what tests. She worries. I worry a little too, but… I try not to. Is that… what she means? She reads a lot of things on the… computer. It confuses me.
DOCTOR: "Strong enough," is rather vague, Manuel. It’s good she’s doing research, though the internet can certainly be… unreliable. What she’s likely referring to is a preconception evaluation. This would involve assessing both your and your wife’s overall health to determine if a pregnancy would pose any risks, and to optimize your chances of success. We would need to review your medical histories, perform a physical examination, and order some laboratory tests. Perhaps we should begin with your medical history, Manuel. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh… many tests. Okay. My history… hmm. Let me think. I had a little trouble with my… water, a long time ago. When I first came to this country. But that was fixed. And… my back. It hurts sometimes, from the model making. But it’s old age, I think. No… no sugars. No blood problems. I don't think so. My wife keeps me going to the doctor for check-ups, so… she would know if something was wrong, yes? I forget.
DOCTOR: "A little trouble with your water" is not particularly informative, Manuel. Was this a kidney issue?
PATIENT: Kidney… maybe? I don't remember the name. It was a long time ago. Very sick. They gave me… medicine. And I drank a lot of water. That helped. They said it was… something with the pipes inside me? But it's all better now. I haven't been sick like that in many years. I go to the regular doctor, and he says I'm okay. Mostly just old man aches and pains.
DOCTOR: It appears we’ll need to obtain your medical records from your regular physician to clarify this “trouble with your water,” as you put it. Vague recollections are insufficient for proper medical assessment, Manuel. Now, let’s move on to surgical history. Have you ever undergone any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… when I was a boy, I had my… the little skin off. You know, when you are a boy? But that was a long, long time ago. And… maybe my teeth? I have had many teeth taken out. Old teeth. But not big surgeries. No cutting open. Just… fixing things. I don't remember much else. My wife knows everything, I think. She takes me to the dentist, too.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history, Manuel?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s hard. My family… they are far away. In… Somalia. I haven’t seen them in many years. My mother… she lived a long time. A very long time. But I don’t know what she… died from. My father… he was a strong man. But he died when I was young. I don’t know about… sicknesses in the family. We didn’t talk about those things much. It was… different then.
DOCTOR: It’s unfortunate that we lack information regarding potential inherited conditions, Manuel. However, we must proceed with what we have. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no smoke. Never smoke. It’s bad for you. My wife… she doesn’t like smoke. It smells bad, and it’s not healthy. I drink… sometimes. A little beer. With dinner. Not every night. Just… sometimes. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: And do you consume any other substances, Manuel?
PATIENT: Substances…? Like… medicines? I take a little pill for my back, sometimes. When it hurts very bad. The doctor gives it to me. And… sometimes I take something for my… joints. They get stiff. But that’s all. Nothing else. I don’t… do drugs. I don’t know about drugs. I am an old man.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe… sometimes my skin gets itchy. But that’s just the heat, I think. Or… dust. I don’t get… big reactions. No swelling. No trouble breathing. My wife would know if I was allergic to something. She’s very careful about what I eat. She checks everything.
DOCTOR: And finally, let’s confirm the medications you mentioned. You take a pill for your back and something for your joints. Can you recall the names of these medications, Manuel?
PATIENT: Oh… the names… they are… long names. I don’t remember. Little white pills. And… a blue one, I think, for my joints. The doctor writes them for me. I just… take them when I need them. I can show you the bottles, maybe? I have them at home. My wife keeps them organized. I’m not good with names.
DOCTOR: It appears we’ll need to obtain a complete medication list from your pharmacy, Manuel. This is becoming increasingly… laborious. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical… okay. Yes. That’s okay. But… it might be hard. I am not very flexible. And… I don’t like being cold. Is it going to be cold? My wife always says I get cold easily.
DOCTOR: We will do our best to minimize your discomfort, Manuel. It will be a routine examination – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic assessment of your musculoskeletal system. It will not be particularly strenuous. Now, if you would please remove your shirt and shoes, we can begin. I will attempt to be as swift as possible.
PATIENT: Oh… take my shirt off? It’s a little cold in here, you know. And… I don’t like showing my skin. But… if you need to, okay. Just… be quick, please? And… maybe a blanket? My wife always has a blanket for me.
DOCTOR: We have a warming blanket available, Manuel. Please, if you would. We will begin with your vital signs. Now, I'm going to measure your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, with a mild murmur. This is not uncommon in individuals of your age. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lung sounds are clear. Now, if you would please lie down, we can assess your abdomen.
PATIENT: My stomach… is it going to hurt? I eat a lot of beans, you know. Sometimes they make me… gassy. And… I have a little bit of a tummy. Is that okay? I try to eat healthy, but… my wife makes good food. And I like to eat.
DOCTOR: A little tenderness in the lower abdomen, likely related to your dietary habits, as you mentioned. No significant masses or organomegaly detected. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'm going to assess your range of motion. Limited range of motion in both shoulders and knees, consistent with age-related changes and your reported back pain. Alright, Manuel. That concludes the physical examination. I need to review your medical records and laboratory results before we can proceed with a definitive assessment.
PATIENT: Laboratory… more tests? Oh dear. It sounds like a lot of work. My wife is going to be very busy. Is it… is it bad? Is there something wrong with me? I just want to have a baby with my wife. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Manuel, please do not jump to conclusions. The laboratory tests are simply a precautionary measure to obtain a comprehensive picture of your overall health and to identify any potential factors that may impact your ability to conceive. It does not necessarily indicate that there is something "wrong" with you. We will need to assess your sperm count, hormone levels, and screen for any underlying medical conditions. Your wife will also require a comprehensive evaluation. Now, I will need to obtain your medical records and a complete list of your medications. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you and your wife to discuss the results of the tests and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… I don't know. It all sounds very complicated. My wife… she understands these things. She will ask the questions. Can she come to the next appointment? I get confused easily. And… I forget things. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, your wife is welcome to accompany you to the follow-up appointment. It is often beneficial to have a second set of ears and a trusted companion during medical consultations. I will schedule the appointment for both of you. Now, I will provide you with a referral to a specialist in reproductive endocrinology. They will be able to conduct a more thorough evaluation of your fertility potential and discuss potential treatment options. Here is the referral form. Please schedule an appointment with the specialist as soon as possible. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: Reproductive… that’s a big word. Okay. I will give this to my wife. She will know what to do. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. We are not getting any younger, you know. And… I really want to hold a baby with my wife. Is there… is there anything I can do now? To… help? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: While we await the results of the tests and the consultation with the specialist, there are a few things you can do, Manuel. Maintain a healthy lifestyle – eat a balanced diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Manage any underlying medical conditions, such as back pain or joint stiffness. And, perhaps most importantly, maintain a positive attitude. Stress can have a significant impact on fertility. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you and your wife all the best.
PATIENT: .
