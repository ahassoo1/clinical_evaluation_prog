DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Engelhaupt, yes. Seventy-nine… Right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. From… well, it doesn't matter where. It’s all rather… unsettling, all this change. I have Medicare, if that’s what you need to know. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Settling in… Yes, yes. People get anxious about moving. Though at your age, one would think you've seen enough change. Alright, well, “settling in” isn’t a medical complaint. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens, young man. I’m seventy-nine, not falling apart! I feel… adequately. Perhaps a little… tired, now that you mention it. But that's just life, isn't it? Is this a questionnaire? I don’t have time for this. Just tell me if everything is… acceptable.
DOCTOR: "Acceptable" isn't a diagnosis, Mrs. Engelhaupt. Tiredness can be a symptom of many things. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Everything tastes a bit… bland, if I’m honest. And I’ve been sleeping rather fitfully. Though, truthfully, I've always been a light sleeper. It’s probably just the new bed. Honestly, I suspect my husband is worrying over nothing. He always does.
DOCTOR: Bland taste, restless sleep… Alright. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Well… sometimes my knees ache a bit when I stand up. But that’s just old age, isn't it? I refuse to complain about every little creak and groan. I have better things to occupy my mind. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. I feel perfectly… functional. I've lived a long life, and I've dealt with far worse than a bit of knee pain and tasteless food. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I’ve answered all your questions. Is there anything else? Because truly, I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… It’s standard procedure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Standard procedure… honestly. Must you be so rough? I do wish young people would show a little more… finesse. But very well, get it over with. The faster you finish, the sooner I can be on my way. And please, be gentle with my arm. It bruises easily.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… unremarkable. Alright. Everything seems… within acceptable limits. Probably just adjustment to the new environment. I recommend a multivitamin and getting plenty of rest.
PATIENT: Acceptable limits? That's all you have to say? Honestly, I came all this way for that? A multivitamin? It sounds utterly ridiculous. I assure you, I have lived a perfectly healthy life without resorting to such… remedies. I think I’ve heard enough. Thank you for your time, although I doubt it was a productive use of either of our afternoons. I shall be going now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Engelhaupt. If you experience any significant changes, please consult another physician. Have a… pleasant day. .
