DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare today. Thank you for choosing our practice. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Medicare is correct. I am here because I am having… a painful time. I want to get this sorted out quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: "A painful time," alright. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of things as efficiently as we can. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: It is… in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Around July 10th, if I remember correctly. It’s a sharp pain. Not constant, but when it comes… it really comes. It makes it hard to… well, to do my work.
DOCTOR: July 10th. Sharp pain, intermittent. And what is your work, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: I erect fences. For farms, mostly. It's… physical work. Lots of lifting, bending, driving the posts… that sort of thing. It used to not bother me. Now… well, now it does.
DOCTOR: Erecting fences… a demanding profession. So, the pain is specifically exacerbated by your work. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Not much, truthfully. Resting helps a little. Sitting very still, mostly. And… a warm bath. But that doesn’t last long. I took some… pills, a friend gave me, but I don’t know what they were. Didn't help much, and I don’t want to take anything I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: “Some pills” from a friend… I strongly advise against taking any medication not prescribed to you directly. We’ll stick to appropriate, documented treatments here. Now, Ms. Reihner, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… like a knife, almost. A sharp, stabbing feeling. Right across the lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, on the left side. It isn't numbness, just… a painful ache that goes down my leg when the sharp pain is bad. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Like a knife, stabbing” and radiating down the left leg. Does the pain worsen with any specific movements other than work?
PATIENT: Yes. Bending over. And… twisting. Even just turning around quickly. Also, sitting for too long makes it worse. Like in the truck, driving. I have to stop every little bit and… stretch. It doesn't help much, but it's better than nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re getting a clearer picture. Now, Ms. Reihner, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, scoliosis, or any other back problems?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. I’ve always been… healthy. Just the usual colds and such. I did break my arm when I was a little girl, but that healed properly. Nothing with my back. My mother had… trouble with her knees, but that was when she got older. I haven’t had any problems like that.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Just the broken arm, and that was fixed with a cast. I've always been careful, tried to avoid anything like that. I need my body for my work, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I can eat anything. No reactions to any medicine I've ever taken. Not that I take much medicine, usually. Just… over-the-counter things for a cold, maybe. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even those over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I stopped taking anything when the pain started. Like I said, I didn’t know what those pills were, and I didn’t want to make things worse. I’m not taking anything right now. Just… trying to manage it.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Reihner, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with some range of motion tests and neurological assessments. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to get this figured out, and I will cooperate fully. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie flat on your back. I'm going to start by palpating your spine to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. This may be slightly uncomfortable, so please let me know if you experience any sharp pain. Can you tell me if this is tender… here?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there… that’s very tender. And… yes, here too, on the left side. It's not a constant pain, but when you press… it really hurts. And… yes, there is a tightness there. It feels like a knot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you bend forward for me, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Oh… that hurts. A lot. It's… a sharp pain in the middle of my back. I can’t bend very far. It feels like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: Okay, don’t force it. Now, can you bend backward, gently?
PATIENT: It's… also painful to lean back. Not as bad as bending forward, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. A stretching pain… and a little bit of the sharp pain. It's… hard to explain. I don’t feel like I can move very freely.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, pain with flexion and extension. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. Please keep your legs straight. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Your muscle strength is… slightly diminished on the left side, compared to the right. It's subtle, but noticeable.
PATIENT: Okay. I feel… weak sometimes on that side. Especially when I'm lifting something heavy. I thought it was just getting older, maybe. But… diminished strength… that sounds concerning.
DOCTOR: It is something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to perform a straight leg raise test. This will help assess for any nerve compression. Please let me know if you experience any pain radiating down your leg. Do you feel any pain radiating down your leg with this maneuver?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! That sends a sharp pain down my leg. Right there… down the back of my thigh. It's… very uncomfortable. Stop, please. That's… that's a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Stop right there. That is a positive straight leg raise test, Ms. Reihner. Based on your history and the findings of the physical exam, I suspect you may have a herniated disc with nerve compression. We need to confirm this with imaging. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely no metal. No implants, no pacemakers, nothing. Just… my bones. I haven't had any surgeries. A herniated disc… that sounds… serious. Will the MRI tell us what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI will provide a detailed image of your spinal cord and discs, allowing us to determine the extent of the herniation and identify any nerve compression. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain and inflammation. I will also give you a referral to a physical therapist. It’s important to understand that these are temporary measures, Ms. Reihner. The MRI will dictate the next steps, which may include injections or, in some cases, surgery. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll get the imaging done first and then discuss all of your options thoroughly. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… a lot to take in. Muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory… I suppose that's better than nothing. Physical therapy sounds good, if it can help. Injections or surgery… that sounds frightening. But… you're right. Let's get the MRI first. Will the MRI tell me why this happened? Was it something I did? And... when can I get the MRI done? I want to get this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: The MRI won't necessarily tell us the exact cause, Ms. Reihner. Herniated discs can occur due to a variety of factors – age-related wear and tear, genetics, improper lifting techniques, and so on. Given your profession, repetitive strain is certainly a possibility. However, pinpointing the precise cause isn’t always possible or even particularly relevant at this stage. As for timing, I’m going to have my assistant schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible – likely within the next 48 to 72 hours. They will contact you directly to arrange a convenient appointment time. I also want to strongly advise you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the results of the MRI. Continued strain could exacerbate the condition. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe pain – seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No heavy lifting. And if anything gets worse… go straight to the hospital. I will avoid lifting anything. I just… want to get back to work. But I also don't want to make things worse. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for getting the MRI done quickly. I appreciate it. I think… that’s all my questions for now. I will wait for the assistant to call.
DOCTOR: Very good. My assistant will be in touch shortly. Here’s a copy of your prescription and referral order. I expect to have the MRI results within a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Reihner. .
