DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to put it simply, I’m just… awfully tired during the day. Even though I’m using my machine every night, like I’m supposed to. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I feel like I should be better rested.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It’s certainly concerning when a CPAP machine isn’t providing the relief expected. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, it’s not like a crashing fatigue, more of a… a heavy feeling. Like I’m wading through mud all day. I find myself dozing off in my chair after lunch, sometimes even during a program on the television. It's embarrassing, frankly. I used to be so sharp, you know? Now… not so much. And it’s not just at home. I was with some colleagues last week and even they noticed I seemed… sluggish. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. A persistent feeling of heaviness and daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use is definitely something we need to investigate. Could you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I started using the machine, oh, about six months ago now. The first couple of months were wonderful, honestly. A real improvement. But this… this sluggishness crept in, oh, I'd say… maybe three months ago? It’s gotten a little worse each week, if I’m honest. Not dramatically, but enough to be worrying me. It’s starting to interfere with things. I used to grade papers late into the night, no problem. Now, I'm struggling to stay awake after dinner.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful information. And to clarify, you said the first two months were wonderful – meaning the tiredness was completely resolved then?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Completely. I felt… normal. Like I hadn’t been dragging myself through life for years. It was a revelation, truly. I could concentrate, I had energy… I was able to really enjoy things again. And then… slowly, almost imperceptibly, the tiredness started to creep back in. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. Just… a little bit more effort to stay awake, a little bit more difficulty focusing. And it’s just gotten gradually worse since then. I really thought the machine was the answer, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It's disheartening when something that initially provides such relief begins to lose its effectiveness. Let’s delve a bit deeper. Aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My wife – ex-wife, now, sadly – used to complain I snored a lot. Of course, that’s why I got the machine in the first place. She doesn’t hear it anymore, naturally. I haven't really noticed anything else… oh, wait. My mouth is a little dry in the mornings. More so than usual. And I’ve been waking up with a bit of a headache a couple of times a week. Not a terrible headache, but enough to notice. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, those details are important, Mr. Paske. Dry mouth and headaches are certainly worth noting, particularly in the context of CPAP therapy. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let’s see. I had pneumonia when I was a boy, a pretty bad case, but recovered fully. High blood pressure for years, managed with medication. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. Otherwise, not much, really. I've always been a pretty healthy fellow, all things considered. I used to walk a good five miles every day, but it's been harder lately with the tiredness, you know? I don't have the energy. The doctor who prescribed the machine did a lot of tests, of course. A sleep study, blood work… everything seemed fine then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That's helpful. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. I've been on it for… oh, goodness, must be ten years now. It keeps things under control, mostly. My numbers are usually good, according to my regular doctor. I haven’t changed the dose recently, and I always take it as prescribed. I'm very careful about that, you know. I believe in listening to the doctors.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've always been very lucky in that regard. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My ex-wife used to tease me about being able to eat anything. A bit of a blessing, really. I can enjoy a good meal without having to worry about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Paske. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My father had heart trouble, passed away in his early seventies. Mother lived to be ninety-two, very healthy until the very end. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has diabetes. And… oh, my grandfather on my mother’s side… he had sleep apnea, they thought. Didn’t have all the fancy machines we have today, though. Just told him to sleep on his side. Doesn’t seem like much, does it? But I suppose that’s all they knew back then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That's very helpful. And finally, could you briefly describe your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’m divorced, as I mentioned. Been about five years now. No children, unfortunately, which is a bit of a regret. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the local library, but it’s been harder to keep up with things lately with the tiredness. I mostly keep to myself these days, reading, watching television, taking the occasional walk when I have the energy. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that recently. I figured it wasn't helping with the sleep. A quiet life, mostly. A bit lonely, perhaps, but… manageable.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That provides a very complete picture. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and mouth. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of… well, poking and prodding, if you know what I mean. But I understand it's necessary. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88. A bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Your throat appears clear, no significant redness or swelling. I do notice some mild dryness of the oral mucosa. Your uvula appears normal, and there’s no evidence of tonsillar enlargement. Alright, Mr. Paske. Everything appears generally normal, but the elevated blood pressure and oral dryness are worth noting. Now, do you have your CPAP mask and machine with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I brought the mask in my bag, and the machine is in the car. I figured it would be helpful for you to take a look at it. It's the one the doctor prescribed me, a ResMed AirSense 10, I believe it was called. I've been very careful to clean it regularly, just like they showed me. It's right here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. This is a ResMed AirSense 10, as you said. It appears to be well-maintained. Let’s take a look at your mask fit. Do you mind putting it on for me?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Here you go. I usually tighten it just so, to get a good seal. I’ve tried different sizes, and this one seems to fit the best. Although, sometimes I still feel a little bit of air leaking around the edges. It's not a big leak, but… noticeable. I’ve tried adjusting the straps, but it doesn't always help. Is that alright? Is it too tight? Too loose? I’m always worried about getting it just right.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. There is a slight leak around the nasal bridge. It's not significant, but it could contribute to suboptimal therapy. And it does appear to be a bit tight. While a snug fit is important, overtightening can cause discomfort and skin irritation. Let’s try loosening it just a bit… there. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That's… better. A little more comfortable, yes. It doesn't feel quite as… pressing on my nose. Although, I'm not sure if it's still sealing properly. It's hard to tell. I’m used to feeling a bit of pressure, I suppose. It's hard to know what’s normal and what’s not. Maybe it's just me being overly sensitive. Do you have a way to test the seal? A little puff of air or something? I wouldn't want to waste your time. It's probably nothing, really. But I just want to make sure I'm getting the most out of this machine. It's a bit expensive, you see. I want it to work properly.
DOCTOR: You're right to be thorough, Mr. Paske. It’s an excellent investment to ensure optimal therapy. Let’s use this leak detector to quantify the amount of leakage. Okay, take a few normal breaths… excellent. The results indicate a small but persistent leak of approximately 15 liters per minute. That’s not ideal. While it may not seem like much, it can reduce the effectiveness of the therapy and cause air dryness. The leak is likely contributing to your symptoms, and it explains the oral dryness. It appears that your mask isn’t creating a completely airtight seal. Let’s discuss some potential solutions.
PATIENT: Oh. 15 liters per minute… is that bad? I had no idea. I just thought a little bit of air escaping was… normal. I suppose I should have said something sooner. I just didn’t want to bother you with something so… minor. But if it's affecting my sleep, then I'm glad we checked. What can we do about it? Do I need a different mask? Or is it something I can adjust myself? I'm a bit worried about the cost of a new mask, honestly. I'm retired, you see. I have to be careful with my money. But if it means getting a good night's sleep, then… well, I'm willing to consider it. Just let me know what you think is best.
DOCTOR: It’s not a minor issue, Mr. Paske, and you did the right thing by bringing it to my attention. It’s very common to have mask fit issues. Fortunately, there are several things we can try before resorting to a new mask. First, we can try different mask cushions. Different sizes and materials can improve the seal. Second, we can adjust the headgear straps to optimize the fit. Third, we can consider using a chinstrap to prevent mouth leaks. Finally, if these measures don’t work, we can explore different mask styles altogether. Before we proceed, do you experience any nasal congestion or dryness when using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my nose does feel a little bit stuffy when I first put the mask on. And it gets drier as the night goes on. I usually use a saline spray before bed to help with that, but it doesn’t always seem to be enough. And sometimes I wake up with a nosebleed, which is not pleasant. I thought it was just a consequence of getting older, you know? Dry winter air and all that. But maybe it’s related to the machine? Should I be using a humidifier with it? I don't think I am currently. The doctor who prescribed it didn't mention anything about a humidifier. I just assumed the saline spray would be enough. Is a humidifier expensive? I don't want to spend a lot of money if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Mr. Paske. The nasal congestion and dryness are likely contributing to both the mask leak and your discomfort. The CPAP machine can dry out the nasal passages, especially if the humidity levels are low. Using a humidifier with your CPAP machine is an excellent idea. It can significantly improve your comfort and reduce the mask leak. There are several types of CPAP humidifiers available, ranging in price from $50 to $200. The heated humidifiers are more expensive, but they provide more consistent humidity levels. We can start with a basic humidifier and see if that improves your symptoms. If not, we can consider upgrading to a heated model. I recommend we also try a different mask cushion size. It’s possible your current cushion is not providing an optimal seal. I’ll have my nurse take some measurements of your face to determine the appropriate size. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A different cushion size and a humidifier… that seems like a good place to start. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I was starting to think I was just getting old and couldn’t sleep anymore, but it sounds like there’s actually something we can do about it. And I’m glad you mentioned the nurse. It's always easier when someone else takes the measurements. I have trouble reaching my nose sometimes. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I'm happy to help in any way I can. This isn’t a race. We’ll work through it together.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Paske. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in to take some measurements and discuss the humidifier options with you. She’s very knowledgeable and will be able to answer any questions you have. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a saline nasal spray with a mild decongestant to help relieve your nasal congestion. This should provide some temporary relief while we address the underlying issues. To summarize, we’re going to try a different mask cushion size, add a humidifier to your CPAP machine, and use a saline nasal spray with a mild decongestant. We’ll reassess your symptoms in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds absolutely perfect. A new cushion, a humidifier, and the nasal spray… that’s a very sensible plan. And two weeks is a good timeframe. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. I feel much more optimistic now, knowing that there’s something we can do to improve my sleep. Thank you. I think that's all for now, right? Just wait for Sarah to come in?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Mr. Paske. Just wait for Sarah. She’ll be in shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Paske. I’m confident we can get your sleep back on track. Have a good day.
