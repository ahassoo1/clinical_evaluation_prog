DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today, as I understand it, to ensure I am fit to move into a senior living facility. A good place to spend my later years, if all goes well.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. A pre-placement physical, then. That's a very sensible thing to do. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, at eighty-one years, things aren't quite as they once were, naturally. But I’ve been fortunate. I’ve always kept busy, and I believe that helps. I bake, you see. Been a baker my whole life. Keeps my hands and mind active. No major illnesses, thankfully. A few aches and pains, here and there… the usual for a man my age. I have private insurance, if that’s helpful information.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’ve stayed so active. Baking is good exercise! And yes, the insurance information is helpful. Just routine. Now, when you say "aches and pains," can you tell me where those are located and how long you’ve been experiencing them?
PATIENT: Certainly. Mostly in my lower back, Doctor. And in my hands, sometimes. The hands aren't surprising, I suppose, with all the kneading. The back… that’s been bothering me for maybe the last five or six years, off and on. It flares up if I stand for too long, or lift something heavy. It doesn’t keep me from baking, mind you, just makes it a little less comfortable afterward. It usually eases up with a good rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain for five or six years, flaring with activity and relieved with rest. Good to know. Have you tried anything specifically for the pain – any over-the-counter medications, or perhaps physical therapy at any point?
PATIENT: I have, Doctor. Years ago, a friend suggested I use some of those creams, you know, the ones you rub on. Helped a little, temporarily. I tried some of those heating pads as well. Nothing long-term, though. Never really considered physical therapy. Always thought I could manage it on my own. I suppose I’ve just… gotten used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. My legs and feet are sound, as far as I can tell. I still walk quite well for my age. I haven’t lost my balance or anything like that, either. I take pride in my steadiness. It's important for a baker, you see, to be on your feet and sure of yourself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other parts of your body. Have you had any changes in your vision, hearing, or dental health recently?
PATIENT: Well, my vision isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I wear glasses, have for many years now. The prescription hasn’t changed much lately, thankfully. My hearing… it’s a little harder to hear quiet sounds, particularly. I don’t have any trouble with loud noises. And my teeth… well, I have a few missing, as you might expect. But I see the dentist regularly, every six months, and he says they’re generally in good condition for an old man. I still manage to eat a good meal, if that's any indication.
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other medical issues, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, or any other significant medical condition?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor, a good many years ago. They put me on some medication for it. I took it for a while, but the doctor later said my numbers were good enough to stop. High cholesterol… no, I don’t believe so. Diabetes, no. Heart disease… no, never been diagnosed with anything like that. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. I've been quite fortunate, as I said. I generally feel quite robust, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. No surgeries, no other hospital stays. Just the pneumonia, when I was a young man. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, but that hardly counts. I’ve always been careful, I suppose. And lucky. I’ve managed to avoid any serious illnesses or injuries, thankfully. A few bumps and bruises along the way, of course, but nothing that required a doctor’s care for any length of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… At the moment, Doctor, I only take a daily multivitamin. Nothing else. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter medications, no herbal supplements. Just the multivitamin, for good measure. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly, but I figure a little extra insurance can’t hurt. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago, but the doctor said it wasn’t necessary anymore. Just the multivitamin now.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. No allergies to medications, food, or anything else. I've always been able to eat anything and everything, thankfully. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. My wife, God rest her soul, was the one with the allergies. Pollen, mostly. I always made sure to keep the windows closed during the spring. But me? No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand a proper exam is important. Please, proceed. I'll do my best to cooperate. I may be a bit stiff, mind you, but I'll hold still as I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is good. Temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Lungs sound a bit congested. I’ll need to ask a few more questions about that later. Abdomen is soft. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow. Now, I’m going to check your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to cooperate. There you are. Not as spry as I once was, but I get around. As I said, I keep busy. Walking is good for the circulation, you know. Baking keeps me active, but walking gets the blood flowing. A bit stiff this morning, perhaps. But generally sound, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. A little slower, and a slightly wider stance, but you’re steady enough. Now, just one more thing. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. Not as strong as I once was, naturally. Years of kneading dough, I suppose, have taken their toll. But I can still manage a good grip. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, good grip strength. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, although I did notice some slight crackling in your lungs and your reflexes are a little slow. And your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Now, I’m going to ask a few more questions about the crackling in your lungs. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not recently. No cough at all, no wheezing, no shortness of breath. I might clear my throat sometimes in the morning, just a bit of phlegm, but nothing persistent. I haven't been sick with a cold or the flu in quite some time, thankfully. As I said, I've been fortunate with my health. The crackling is a bit of a surprise, you say? Perhaps it's just age, or the dry air? We’ve had a spell of hot, dry weather lately.
DOCTOR: It could be the weather, or just some normal age-related changes. However, to be safe, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying infection or congestion. Also, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. If it eases your mind, I have no objection at all. An X-ray and some blood tests… I trust your judgment. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I’ll do whatever it takes to ensure I’m fit for the senior living facility. When would those tests be scheduled? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can schedule the X-ray and blood tests at the lab just down the hall this afternoon. The blood tests will require an eight-hour fast, so nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. They’ll draw blood first thing in the morning. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds straightforward enough. Eight-hour fast. No food or drink after midnight. I can manage that. It's a small inconvenience, and well worth it if it ensures I am in good health. I appreciate your thoroughness. And I trust your instructions. I will be sure to follow them carefully. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab will have the necessary paperwork for you. They'll also explain the procedure. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever, please contact us immediately. And, given your age and potential for falls, I recommend having a flu and pneumonia vaccine if you haven't had one recently. We can administer those here at the clinic. Would you like me to schedule those as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be excellent. Flu and pneumonia vaccine. A good idea. I trust your judgment completely. Better to be proactive, as they say. Perhaps I should have done that years ago, but… better late than never. And thank you for reminding me about the potential for falls. I am generally steady, but it's wise to be cautious. I appreciate your thoroughness and your concern. So, to recap: X-ray and blood tests this afternoon, paperwork at the lab, and the vaccines scheduled for a later date. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. X-ray and blood tests this afternoon, paperwork at the lab, and we’ll schedule the flu and pneumonia vaccines. I will also have the lab results sent to my office, and we’ll review them together next week. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. Here’s a referral for the lab and a summary of today’s visit. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything admirably. I appreciate your thorough examination, your clear explanations, and your kind manner. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll head to the lab now and get those tests scheduled. Thank you again for your time and your care. I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. You take care, and I’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
