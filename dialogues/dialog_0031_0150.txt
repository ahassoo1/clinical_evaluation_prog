DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this. I need to get this sorted. I want to be pregnant, and I want it to be…easy. No problems. I’m 51, not 20, you know. I don’t want complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, perfectly clear. You’re hoping to become pregnant and want to ensure a smooth and uncomplicated process, given your age. I understand your concerns completely. To help me assess the best course of action, let's gather some information. First, have you been trying to conceive for a specific length of time?
PATIENT: Trying? That implies effort. Let's just say… it hasn’t happened yet. And frankly, I'm a bit surprised it hasn't, considering. I was married, you know. A perfectly…functional marriage. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is, no, I haven't been “trying” for any length of time. I assumed it would just…work. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s not a problem at all, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s quite common to assume conception will be straightforward, and it's perfectly valid to feel surprised when it doesn't happen as quickly as expected. Given your age, it’s wise to explore the possibilities and understand any factors that might be involved. We want to make sure everything is optimal. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Honestly. Look, I'm perfectly healthy. I eat reasonably, I don’t smoke, I haven’t got any… dreadful diseases. Divorced, as you probably know. That was stressful, but I’m over it. I have Medicare, so I’m covered for… things. I had a bicycle accident a few years ago, but it was just scrapes. Good bicycle repairers fixed me right up. Is that what you want to know? My medical history is… unremarkable. It’s all very… pedestrian.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That's helpful. No serious illnesses, a non-smoker, and a recent bicycle accident with no lasting complications. Medicare coverage is good to know as well. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – even if they seemed minor at the time?
PATIENT: Minor? What qualifies as "minor?" I had a bad flu once, in the 90s, I think. And a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing a good rest and some tea couldn’t fix. And my knees ache sometimes, if I cycle too far uphill. But that’s just… getting older, isn’t it? Everyone’s knees ache. And a slight… irregularity with my periods for a few months, years ago. But it sorted itself out. It’s all very… fiddly. Are you writing all this down? It’s rather a waste of your time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Ms. Shteynberg. Even seemingly small details can be relevant. The flu, occasional knee discomfort, and the past irregularity with your periods are all helpful pieces of information. Regarding the period irregularity, could you recall approximately when that occurred, and how long it lasted?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years ago. Early 2000s, I suppose. It was…stop, start. Not every month. And then it just… settled down. A few months, maybe six. I didn't bother going to the doctor. It wasn't serious. I had a business to run, bicycles to fix. I didn’t have time to spend sitting in waiting rooms. Honestly, I have a very good memory for bicycle parts, but dates… not so much. It was a long time ago. Is it absolutely necessary to know this?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. It's perfectly fine if you don't recall the exact details. Knowing it occurred in the early 2000s and resolved on its own is helpful. To get a clearer picture, and to ensure we’re taking the appropriate steps, I would like to ask about your family medical history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – your mother, sisters, or aunts – have experienced any difficulties with fertility, early menopause, or any hormone-related conditions?
PATIENT: Family? Honestly, a disaster. My mother… very dramatic. Always complaining about something. I don’t discuss family. And I was an only child. No sisters. Aunts? Distant relatives I barely knew. Always meddling. No, I have absolutely no information about their… internal workings. And frankly, I wouldn’t want it. It’s all terribly… unsavoury. Look, can we move on? I’m starting to feel rather… impatient. Is there a test we can just do?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to discuss family history, Ms. Shteynberg. It's perfectly alright if you prefer not to share that information. Yes, there are several tests we can consider. To begin, I’d like to perform a physical exam and order some basic blood tests. These tests will help us assess your overall health and check your hormone levels, which are important for fertility. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. I have a business to run, you know. People need their bicycles fixed. And I need to get this… sorted. The faster we do this, the better. Blood tests. Exam. Let’s just… proceed. But please, no unnecessary chatter. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I will keep the examination as efficient as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. And while I do this, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, including any over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Really? I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And ibuprofen occasionally, for my knees. That’s it. Perfectly healthy, as I said. No… dreadful prescriptions. No… potent concoctions. Just a multivitamin and ibuprofen. Honestly, you’re making me feel rather… unwell, just asking all these questions. Is this… standard procedure? Because it’s rather… tedious. Is my blood pressure alright? I always worry about those machines. They seem… overly dramatic.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not cause for immediate concern. We can monitor it. Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. I’ll also check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. Now, I'd like to perform a pelvic exam. We'll need to check your reproductive organs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I haven’t… been to a gynecologist in… well, a very long time. Honestly, it feels rather… intrusive. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite… uncomfortable. Can't you just take more blood? Or… scan me? Anything to avoid… that. I’m a busy woman. I have responsibilities. And bicycles to fix. Is there any alternative? It feels rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Shteynberg. A pelvic exam is a standard part of evaluating fertility, as it allows us to assess the health of your reproductive organs and identify any potential issues that might be contributing to difficulty conceiving. While we could proceed with additional blood tests or imaging, those wouldn't provide the same level of information. However, I absolutely respect your boundaries. We can discuss alternative approaches, but it’s important to understand that without a proper examination, it will be difficult to determine the underlying cause of any challenges. Perhaps we can start with a discussion of the potential benefits of the examination, and address any specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. And gentle. Honestly, I'm trusting you here. I don’t do… doctors. And I really, really don't do… intrusions. Explain it to me, then. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will this… ordeal take? And please, no unnecessary chatter. Just tell me what you’re going to do, and then… do it. Quickly. Before I change my mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. The examination will allow me to assess the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries, check for any tenderness or abnormalities, and evaluate the overall health of your pelvic organs. It will also allow me to visualize your cervix. I’ll start by having you lie on the examination table with your knees bent. I’ll then gently insert a speculum into your vagina to visualize your cervix. This may cause some mild discomfort. I’ll then collect a sample for a Pap smear and check for any signs of infection. Finally, I'll perform a bimanual exam, where I’ll gently press on your abdomen to assess the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries. The entire examination should take approximately 10-15 minutes. I will explain each step as I go and stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And please, be gentle. I really mean it. And no… unnecessary prodding. I'm a fragile woman, you know. And explain everything, as you said. I need to know what you’re doing, every step of the way. Just… don't take too long. I have bicycles to fix. And a life to get back to. Just… proceed. But gently. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg, I'm just going to gently insert the speculum now. It may feel a bit cool and slightly uncomfortable. Take a deep breath… there you go. Now, I’m just going to visualize your cervix. This won't take long… Your cervix appears normal in size and shape. I'm now going to collect a small sample for a Pap smear. This may feel a bit of pressure… Okay, that’s done. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam. I’ll gently press on your abdomen to assess your uterus and ovaries. Your uterus feels normal in size and shape. Your ovaries are slightly enlarged, but there's no tenderness. Everything feels relatively normal. Okay, that’s all done. I’ll just remove the speculum now. There we go. That’s it. You did very well, Ms. Shteynberg. Now, we’ll need to send the Pap smear sample to the lab for analysis. That will take about a week. We will also review your hormone levels, which we’ll get from the blood tests. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results. Quickly. And tell me… what does "slightly enlarged" mean? Is it… serious? Honestly, I don't need a lot of detail. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about. And if I need to… do anything. And the sooner, the better. I have a business to run. And a life to get back to. No time for… complications. Just tell me the bottom line. Is it fixable? Is it serious? That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shteynberg. “Slightly enlarged” ovaries can mean a number of things, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. It could be due to a normal variation, a small cyst, or other benign causes. However, it's important to investigate further to determine the underlying cause. The blood tests will help us assess your hormone levels, which can provide valuable information. Depending on the results, we may recommend a pelvic ultrasound to get a clearer picture of your ovaries. At this point, I wouldn't say it's something to panic about, but it does warrant further investigation. We'll take it one step at a time. I'll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they're available, and I'll contact you immediately to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – such as pelvic pain, bloating, or changes in your menstrual cycle – please contact me right away. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… contact me when you have the results. Quickly. And if it's something… serious, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I’m a busy woman. And I don’t have time for… uncertainties. Just the facts. That’s all I need. Thank you. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. I'll contact you as soon as the results are available, and I'll be as straightforward as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day.
