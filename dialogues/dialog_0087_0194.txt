DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhaugh. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My hearing… it comes and goes. And I get dizzy sometimes, really dizzy. It’s been happening for a little while now, and my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come see someone. She’s worried about it, and… well, my husband, he used to have something similar. Something with his ears, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in, and it’s thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. It’s also helpful to know your husband had similar issues. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Could you describe what you mean by “comes and goes” with your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… hard to say exactly. Sometimes I can hear perfectly fine, like right now. But then, other times… it’s like someone turned the volume way down, or put cotton in my ears. Everything sounds muffled. It doesn’t happen all the time, and it’s not in one ear or the other, not usually. It just… fades. And then comes back. It's happened a few times in the last month, I think. Maybe more? I lose track, you know. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s fluctuating hearing loss – sometimes clear, sometimes muffled – and it doesn't seem to be consistently in one ear. And you've noticed it happening more frequently in the last month. When you experience the dizziness, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… that’s not a nice feeling, I can tell you that. It’s not just feeling a little unsteady, it’s like… everything is spinning. The room spins, I spin, and I have to hold onto something. It makes me feel quite sick, actually. Sometimes it happens when I stand up too quickly, but other times it just comes on for no reason at all. It doesn't last long, usually just a few minutes, but it's frightening when it happens. I get a bit panicked, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite distressing, Ms. Mayhaugh. So, it's a spinning sensation – vertigo – sometimes triggered by standing, but also occurring spontaneously. It's good you've noted it's brief, but I can appreciate how frightening it must be. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss or dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, sometimes I feel a little bit of pressure in my ears when the hearing goes. Not pain, exactly, just… fullness. And I’ve been a bit more tired lately, but honestly, at my age, who isn’t tired? I haven't noticed anything else, not that I can recall. Oh! And sometimes my balance feels a bit off, even when I don't feel dizzy. Just a little wobbly. Is that something?
DOCTOR: That's all helpful information, Ms. Mayhaugh. The fullness in your ears, increased fatigue, and the occasional unsteadiness are all things I want to consider. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be twenty years ago now. And I have a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands and knees. It flares up sometimes. Other than that… I don’t really think so. I try to stay healthy, you know? I see the doctor for check-ups when I need to. I take some vitamins, but nothing regular. Oh, and I get Medicare, of course. Is that what you need to know? I'm a bit forgetful, you see. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Mayhaugh. Gallbladder removal and arthritis are noted. Thank you for mentioning your Medicare coverage as well. And please don’t worry about being forgetful; it’s perfectly understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements – for your arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… For my arthritis, I take ibuprofen sometimes, when it's really bad. Just the over-the-counter kind. And I take a multivitamin, like I said. Nothing else, I don’t think. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. My daughter is always telling me to be careful with medications, bless her heart. She's a nurse, you know. She worries a lot. I’m pretty sure that’s all. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you may have, if you are aware of any. This includes medications, food, or environmental allergies.
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I get a bit of a runny nose sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just hay fever, I think. Nothing I need an EpiPen for, thankfully. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medications that I’m aware of. My daughter asked me this before, and I told her the same thing. She's very thorough. I’m pretty sure that’s all, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known drug or food allergies, just seasonal hay fever. That's good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your situation, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That's a bit tricky. My husband… he had problems with his balance, like I said. The doctor said something about his inner ear, Meniere’s disease, maybe? He had to be very careful. And his mother, she also had trouble hearing when she got older. Beyond that… my parents were both pretty healthy, as far as I know. They passed away a long time ago. It’s hard to remember all the details now, you know? I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. Knowing about your husband’s balance issues and your grandmother’s hearing loss is helpful. Finally, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a little when he was younger, but he quit years ago. It's a terrible habit, you know? No, I don't smoke. And I don't drink very much either, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to stay healthy, as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhaugh. That gives me a good overview. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve checking your ears, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your balance and reflexes. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… well, alright, dear. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. I always get a bit nervous with doctors, you know? But if you think it will help, then yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhaugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm just going to take a look inside your ears now. I see a little bit of cerumen – earwax – in both ears, but nothing obstructing the view. Your ear canals appear clear. Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. No murmurs, rales, or wheezes detected. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to balance for about 30 seconds with your feet together and your eyes open?
PATIENT: Oh alright. Thirty seconds… hmm. Oh dear, I'm not very steady, am I? This is harder than it looks. I think that's about thirty seconds. I never was very good at balancing, even when I was younger. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. It’s good to know where your baseline is. You do have some mild unsteadiness, which is consistent with your reported symptoms and dizziness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, I suspect your symptoms might be related to a vestibular issue – something affecting your inner ear balance system. However, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. Would you be open to scheduling a hearing test – an audiogram – and possibly a VNG – videonystagmography – which measures your eye movements to assess your inner ear function?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? Well, if you think it’s necessary, dear. I don’t like tests, but I want to know what’s going on. This dizziness is quite frightening, you know? If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, go ahead. What do these tests involve? Will they be painful? I’m a bit worried, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Mayhaugh. Both tests are non-invasive and generally painless. The audiogram – the hearing test – involves wearing headphones and listening to different tones and sounds at various frequencies. It assesses the range and sensitivity of your hearing. The VNG – the videonystagmography – involves wearing goggles and having your eye movements recorded while we vary your head position and introduce warm and cool air into your ears. This helps us assess the function of your vestibular system, which controls balance. It will take about an hour to complete both tests. We can schedule them for next week, if that works for you. We can also discuss the results and a treatment plan after the tests are completed. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sudden movements and staying well-hydrated. If you experience a severe episode of dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh alright. That… that doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. No pain is good. Next week sounds fine. I’ll try to avoid sudden movements. And I will drink more water. Thank you, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I just want to feel normal again. Alright, let’s schedule the tests for next week, then. I trust your judgement. Thank you again, Dr. Soodeen. Is there anything else I need to do before then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. I’m glad I could explain everything clearly. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for an audiogram and VNG next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. The order is being sent to the audiology department, and they will contact you to confirm the appointment. No, there's nothing else you need to do before then. Just be well-rested and arrive a few minutes early to complete some paperwork. Here's a printed summary of our discussion today, including the scheduled tests. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh alright, Tuesday at 10:00 AM. I’ll remember that. Thank you for the summary. No, I think that’s all, dear. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’m a bit worried, but I feel better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure things out. Thank you again, Dr. Soodeen. I’ll see you next Tuesday. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes before your appointment. You have a good day as well, Ms. Mayhaugh. I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
