DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up. For the insurance. Before it starts, you understand. I need to be sure I am… approved. It is a pre-insurance physical, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-insurance physical. Yes, I understand. That's perfectly reasonable. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmm. It is… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. What more is there to tell? I do not have… problems. Not that I know of. It is all… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Normal" is good to hear. Just to be thorough, and to make sure everything is as normal as you say, let’s go through a few things. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. Nothing like that. No cough. No fever. No… aches. Just… tired sometimes. From the work, you understand. It is a long day. But not… a problem. It is normal to be tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness from work, that makes sense. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? No change. I eat the same. Maybe a little more in the summer, the fruit is good this year. But not much. Appetite is… normal. I eat when I am hungry. It is simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your bowel movements and urination?
PATIENT: Doctor, you are asking… personal questions now. Is this… necessary for the insurance? I go to the bathroom when I need to. Everything is… regular. I do not understand why you need to know this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It is a bit personal, but it's standard procedure for a physical exam, even a pre-insurance one. We need to get a complete picture of your health. It helps us make sure everything is functioning properly and can identify any potential issues early on. “Regular” is good to hear, but just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in frequency, color, or consistency?
PATIENT: Changes? No. I do not… check the color. I go when I need to. It is… brown, I think. Like it always is. I do not… analyze it. It is a waste of time. Is this all you will ask about? It is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We won’t dwell on it. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. I take nothing. I do not like medicine. It makes me… feel strange. My mother, she had some problems with… something, a flower, but I do not. I am fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never needed one. Illnesses… when I was a child, the usual things. A fever, a cough. Nothing serious. Nothing that needed a… doctor. Just… sick for a few days. Nothing like… a hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries. That's good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family? They are… in Yemen. Mostly. My mother is… old now. My brother, he lives in… the city. They are… healthy, I think. I do not speak to them often. It is… difficult. They have… their own problems. I do not know of any… big illnesses in the family. Nothing that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! I am a respectable man. I do not do such things. Smoking is… bad for you. Alcohol… makes you foolish. And… those other things… I do not even know what you are talking about. I work hard. I do not need such things. This is… a strange question.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Okay, Mr. Barban, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes. Fine. As long as it is… quick. I have things to do. Just the vital signs, yes? No… poking. I do not like being poked. But yes, proceed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a quick check. Alright, first, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, let’s check your pulse. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. And finally, I'll just take your temperature. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam looks good. I'd recommend keeping an eye on your blood pressure, and try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Stress-reducing activities? I work. That is my life. That is my activity. Is this all you will say? Will this be enough for the insurance? I do not want to come back. And… what does “elevated” mean? Is it bad? I do not understand these… words. Just tell me if I am approved, yes?
DOCTOR: “Elevated” blood pressure just means it’s slightly higher than the ideal range, but it’s not a cause for immediate concern. It can often be managed with lifestyle changes, like reducing stress, as you mentioned, and maintaining a healthy diet. As for the insurance, I can certainly document everything we’ve discussed today – your medical history, the physical exam findings, and my overall assessment – and submit it to them. Based on what we’ve done, I don’t foresee any issues with your pre-insurance approval. However, I can’t guarantee approval; that’s ultimately up to the insurance company. I'm finishing up the documentation now. It may take a few days for them to process it. I will have my staff contact you when I receive a response. Do you have any further questions for me right now before I finish?
PATIENT: No. Just… contact me when you hear back. Do not keep me waiting. And tell your staff to… be clear. I do not want any confusion. This has been… enough for today. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Barban. We’ll do our best to get this processed quickly and will ensure clear communication. Have a good day. And if you do have any questions that come up later, please don’t hesitate to call the office. My staff will escort you out.
