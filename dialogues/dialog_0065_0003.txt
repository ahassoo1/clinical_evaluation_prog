DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, you know? It's this…shaking. My hand. Been happening for a while now. Gets worse when I try to…well, do things. It’s annoying, that's what it is. Mostly annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. But shaking can be indicative of several things, Mr. Baide, and we need to determine the cause of the annoyance. "A while now" is rather vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Honestly? I don't do specific. It started…sometime after Millie passed. Maybe six months after? A year? Time just…blurs. It wasn't immediate. Just slowly got worse. I used to be able to hold a glass steady, you know? Now it’s… precarious. It's not like it's stopping me from living, if that's what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: Six to twelve months… alright. And you mentioned it worsened with activity. What specific activities exacerbate the shaking?
PATIENT: Exacerbate? Really? Must you use such fancy words? Look, anything that requires…precision. Eating soup is a disaster. Writing – forget about it. Even holding a remote is getting tricky. Used to be able to change the channel like a young man. Now it’s a whole…production. It’s embarrassing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing, I understand. So, it primarily affects fine motor skills – tasks requiring delicate movements. Have you noticed the shaking when you are resting?
PATIENT: Resting? Like…sitting and doing nothing? Hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. Not always, mind you. But yeah, I’ll be sitting in my chair, watching the news, and it'll just…start. It's faint then, not like when I’m trying to eat or something. It's just…there. Annoying, still.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this shaking been accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, you know, being my age. And my knees…they ache now and then. But that’s just getting old, isn't it? I don't have fevers or anything dramatic. Honestly, doc, I just want this shaking to stop.
DOCTOR: We'll attempt to ascertain the cause, Mr. Baide. Have you experienced any changes in your gait – how you walk?
PATIENT: My gait? What is a gait? Oh, you mean walking? Look, I walk like an old man. A little slower than I used to, maybe a bit more careful. I don't stumble or anything. Millie used to say I had a bit of a swagger, back in the day. But that was before…well, before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles?
PATIENT: Stiffness… hmm. Sometimes. My hands feel…tight, especially in the mornings. Makes it harder to… grip things. Like opening a jar. Now that's a problem. I used to be able to open anything. It's just…everything is harder now. I blame it on the weather. It’s always the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I'm going to perform a brief neurological examination. This will involve assessing your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. It's a standard procedure, and will help me to narrow down the potential causes of your shaking. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? I suppose. But don't poke and prod too much, alright? I'm not a young man anymore. And frankly, I’ve got things to do. How long is this going to take?
DOCTOR: It will be relatively quick, Mr. Baide. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes. Please, have a seat here, and I'll begin with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen minutes, you said? Fine. Let’s get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. Don’t go poking around too much, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Relax your leg, please. Now, can you point your toes upwards, and then downwards?
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. There. Is that good enough? It feels a little stiff, you know. Like I said, the weather.
DOCTOR: Now, can you open and close your hands for me, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: See? Shaking. Just like I said. Are you going to fix it, or what? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, and alternate?
PATIENT: There. It's not easy, you know? This is… difficult. Honestly, I’m starting to feel foolish.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on my examination, the findings are suggestive of a possible tremor, potentially consistent with essential tremor or, less likely but requiring investigation, early stages of Parkinson’s disease. However, further testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis. I'd like to order a blood test to rule out any other underlying causes, and I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s? Now you’re just trying to scare me! I feel fine, aside from this shaking. Blood test? A neurologist? Look, doc, I’m eighty years old! I don’t need a bunch of tests and specialists poking and prodding. I just want this shaking to stop. Can’t you just give me something for it? A pill, maybe? I don't need a diagnosis, I need a solution.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but a diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment. Simply masking the symptom without understanding the cause could delay proper care and potentially worsen the condition. While I can prescribe medication to help manage the tremors, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause first. I strongly recommend the blood test and the neurological referral. The neurologist can perform a more detailed examination and, if necessary, consider further imaging studies. However, I will not prescribe medication without a clear understanding of what we are treating. It would be irresponsible of me. Would you at least consider the blood test?
PATIENT: Fine. A blood test. Just a blood test. But no neurologists, understand? I'm not going to spend my remaining years being poked and prodded by some young doctor who only cares about making a name for themselves. Just the blood test. And make it quick. I’ve got a game show to watch.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. I will order the blood test now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the sample today. The results should be available in a few days. I will contact you to discuss them as soon as they are in. In the meantime, I can offer some general advice. Avoid caffeine and excessive stress, as these can exacerbate tremors. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the blood test order. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get me out of here. Caffeine…stress… easier said than done, you know? I’ll try. Just…get it over with. And no neurologists. Remember that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. No neurologists, I remember. Here’s the paperwork with the lab order and a summary of our consultation. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Thank you for your time.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Let's get this over with.
