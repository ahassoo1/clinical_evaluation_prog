DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be quick about it, I just need some papers signed and verified. They’re health forms, you see. I don’t have insurance right now, and they need a doctor's signature to… well, to be official. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Forms, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, forms. I brought them with me. Here they are. It’s mostly just confirming I'm… well, that I am who I say I am and that I'm generally healthy enough to… do things. It's for a program, see. A senior program. They're very strict about the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Right. And you haven't actually seen a doctor for a check-up recently, just need these signed?
PATIENT: Well, not recently. It's been a while, yes. Things were fine then, you know? I mostly just need the signature so I can get started with the program. It helps with groceries, and… other things. It would be a big help. Is that a problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A problem?
PATIENT: Well, I didn’t mean to cause trouble! It’s just… they said a signature was enough. I'm feeling alright, really. Just a little creaky in the mornings, you know? Old age! I just want to get this sorted, if that’s alright. Are you able to sign them, or do I need to go somewhere else? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, simply signing a document stating you are “generally healthy” without a proper assessment is… irresponsible. I am a physician, not a notary. I can't ethically sign off on something without knowing your current medical state.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I didn't realize… I thought, well, since I brought the forms, and I am generally healthy… It's just a senior program. They need proof, but they didn’t say I needed a full check-up. So, what do I do then? Do I need to find another doctor? I don’t have a lot of time, and… well, honestly, I don't have a lot of money for a whole examination.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Tippens, I understand budget constraints. However, I can’t bypass a basic medical evaluation. At your age, even a "quick" assessment is vital. We need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, perhaps a quick look at your reflexes… it’s standard procedure. We can do a limited exam, focusing on key areas. It won't be a full workup, but it'll give me enough information to reasonably sign the forms. Will that work?
PATIENT: A limited exam… yes, that sounds… manageable. How much would that cost, roughly? And how long would it take? I really do need to get going this afternoon. If it's going to be a long, expensive thing, I might have to look at other options. I appreciate you even considering it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. A limited exam—blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, basic neurological assessment, and a quick review of your current medications—will be $75. It should take approximately 30-40 minutes. And, I'll need a complete list of any medications you're currently taking. Do you have that with you?
PATIENT: $75… yes, that's… doable. Here. It's not very neat, I apologize. It’s mostly just… something for my arthritis. And a little something for my blood pressure, when it gets high. It’s all here, I think. Is that enough? Do you need anything else before we start? I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Sit here, please, and relax your arm. We’ll get this done quickly. And, Ms. Tippens, please try to be more thorough with your medical history in the future. “Something for my arthritis” is not a diagnosis.
PATIENT: Yes, you’re right. I should have been more… organized. It’s just… everything feels so complicated these days. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much in the past few years. But I understand. Just… hurry if you could, please? The program people are very strict about deadlines.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this done. Top number is 148, bottom is 92. A little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Tippens.
PATIENT: Alright, I'm breathing. Is everything okay? It feels a little tight in my chest sometimes, but it's probably just… old age. I get short of breath walking up hills, too, but I just slow down. Should I be concerned about the chest tightness? Is that why you're listening so carefully?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs. And your blood pressure is consistently elevated. The chest tightness, combined with the shortness of breath, warrants further investigation. It could be a number of things – bronchitis, early signs of pneumonia, or even something more serious. We need to run some tests. A chest X-ray and a blood test.
PATIENT: Tests? X-rays? Blood tests? Oh dear. How much will that cost? I really can’t afford… I just needed a signature, not a whole… a whole investigation! I thought I was just a little creaky. Is this because of the chest tightness? Is it something serious? Maybe I should just… go home. Maybe the program isn’t that important after all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your financial concerns. But ignoring these symptoms is not an option. A chest X-ray will cost approximately $150, and the blood tests, around $80. I strongly advise against dismissing this. We need to rule out anything serious, and that requires these tests. You’re 76 years old. Your health is fragile. A simple signature isn’t worth jeopardizing your well-being. We can discuss a payment plan if necessary. But we will run these tests. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any other medications?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? Oh dear, I don’t even know. I haven't had tests in… decades. I… I don't have the money. Not for all of that. I just wanted to join the senior program, get a little help with groceries… I didn't want to spend a fortune at the doctor's office. Maybe… maybe I'll just go home and… rest. It's probably just a cold. It'll pass. Thank you for your time, Doctor. But I can't afford any of this.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Tippens. However, I must document that I advised you to undergo further testing, and you declined. This is against my professional judgment. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a high fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I won’t be able to sign the forms without a proper evaluation. Have a… good day.
