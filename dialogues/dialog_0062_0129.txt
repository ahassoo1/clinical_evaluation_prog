DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good morning! I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s this stool. Black as night, it is. And I take these pills, you know, for the arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. I just… I don’t have time for this, frankly. Is it the pills, or what?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black stool can definitely be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. And you're also worried about whether your arthritis medication might be playing a role. We'll figure this out. First, let’s talk about this stool. When did you first notice it being dark?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A couple of weeks now, maybe? Honestly, I don’t keep a calendar of my… leavings. It just started being dark, and I thought, well, it's probably those pills. They upset my stomach sometimes. But it hasn’t gone away. And I read things on the internet, you know, and now I’m worried. Is it serious? Just tell me straight, doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dawnetta, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Reading things online can definitely make anxiety worse. It's good you're being proactive. Okay, a couple of weeks of dark stool. We definitely need to investigate this further. While it could be related to your arthritis medication, dark stool can have several causes, some of which we need to rule out. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s get a bit more information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the color?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kind of changes? I go to the bathroom when I need to go, dear. It’s not a complicated process. It's… thinner, I suppose. Not as… substantial as usual. And sometimes it’s a little… harder to get out. But that could just be the pills, couldn’t it? I eat perfectly fine, mostly. No fancy foods. Just good, solid Czech cooking.
DOCTOR: Okay, thinner stools and a bit harder to pass, alongside the dark color. That’s helpful information. It could be the pills, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool, even a small amount?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! I would know if there was blood. I'm not an idiot, doctor. And frankly, I don’t appreciate you implying there is. I told you it's probably the pills. Why are you asking me all these silly questions? Are you even listening to me? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem silly or if I've upset you, Dawnetta. I assure you I am listening. I need to ask these questions to get a complete picture of what’s going on and to make sure we don’t miss anything important. It’s not about implying anything, it’s about being thorough. Okay, no blood in the stool. Good. Let’s talk about your arthritis medication for a moment. What’s the name of the medication, and what dosage are you taking?
PATIENT: Honestly, all these names... It's a little white pill. Two of 'em, twice a day. My husband gets it for me, I don't bother with the details. Something with a 'naproxen' in it, maybe? He handles all that. I just take 'em when my joints ache. It's enough to know it helps, really. Why does it matter what I take? It’s probably messing up my insides, that’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill twice a day, something with naproxen in it. That gives us a good starting point. It is possible the medication is causing some irritation, which could explain the changes you're seeing. Now, have you had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or any other symptoms along with the changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, a little bit of a tummy ache sometimes. Nothing to write home about. And I feel a bit tired, but honestly, who doesn't these days? I'm seventy-three years old, doctor, things ache and things get tired. I don't need a lecture on getting old. I just want to know if this black stool is something serious, or if I’m just wasting my time here. And frankly, I'd like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. You’re right, at 73, a little tummy ache and fatigue are common. But it’s important to rule out any serious causes for the changes you’re experiencing. Okay, so a little tummy ache and fatigue along with the dark stool and changes in bowel habits. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your abdomen and listen to your bowel sounds. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Poke and prod, you mean? Honestly, I’m not sure I like this. I haven’t got time for a full examination. I just want a simple answer. Is it the pills, or isn’t it? If it’s the pills, I'll talk to my husband. If it’s something else... well, I don't even want to think about it. But I suppose, if you must. Just be quick about it. And don’t expect me to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dawnetta. It’ll be a very quick exam, just to help me get a better idea of what’s going on. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It'll help me determine if further testing is needed. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It won’t be cold. Then, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't go poking around too much. My husband will be furious if I'm sore later. And I'm warning you, I bruise easily. Just get it over with, doctor. I haven’t got all day. Honestly, I don't know why they make these tables so hard. It’s like lying on a rock.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. Just relax as much as you can. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Okay. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, a little diminished but not significantly abnormal. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Hmm. A little tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Not significant, but worth noting. No masses or guarding. Everything else feels normal. Alright, Dawnetta. That’s all. You can sit up whenever you’re ready. Did you feel any pain during the exam?
PATIENT: A little bit of discomfort when you pressed on that side. Nothing terrible, just… uncomfortable. I get indigestion sometimes, you know. It’s probably just that. Honestly, I think you're making too much of this. It’s probably just old age. And those pills. So, can we just be done now? What do you think it is? Is it serious? I need to get home and have a lie-down. I'm getting too old for all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. Mild tenderness in the lower right quadrant, along with the dark stool and changes in bowel habits. Given your age and symptoms, and the tenderness I found, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on without some further testing. While it could be related to the arthritis medication, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Dark stool and abdominal tenderness can sometimes indicate a problem with the digestive tract, such as a diverticulitis, or even something less common. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, you doctors just love to poke and prod and send you off for endless tests! It's probably just the pills, I tell you! But… fine. If it will get you to stop bothering me, yes. Order your tests. But don’t expect me to come back if they're just going to tell me it’s nothing. And where do I go for these tests? I don’t drive anymore, you know. My husband will have to take me. Honestly, this is such a hassle. Just tell me if I need to worry, or if I can just go home and have a lie-down. That’s all I want. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. I understand your frustration. I’ll write you a requisition for a CBC and a stool test. You can go to the lab at City General Hospital. It’s just down the street. The receptionist will help you with the paperwork. It shouldn’t take too long. The results should be back in a few days. I’ll have the receptionist give you a call when they’re ready, and we can discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or if you notice any blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
