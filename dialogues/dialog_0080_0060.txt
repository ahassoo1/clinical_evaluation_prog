DOCTOR: Hi Blain, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Honestly? It's probably nothing, but my family… we have a history. My grandmother, then my aunt… both had… problems. Heart problems, mostly. And my mom’s always been really anxious about it. I just… I want to know I’m okay, you know? Reassurance, I guess. I’m probably fine, but it’s better to be safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain, that’s a very sensible approach. Family history is important, and it’s always better to be proactive about your health. Knowing your history helps us understand potential risks. So, you’re coming in because of concerns related to your family’s heart issues and wanting a check-up for reassurance?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And honestly, I’m a bit skeptical of doctors sometimes. My mom drags me to specialists for everything, and half the time it’s nothing. So, I’m hoping you can just… tell me straight. No unnecessary tests if you don’t think they’re needed, okay? I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just… a waste of time and money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Blain. I agree – we want to be efficient and avoid unnecessary testing. My goal is to listen to your concerns, do a thorough assessment, and give you the most honest and straightforward information possible. No pressure, no wasted time. Okay, let’s start with a bit more detail about your family history. You mentioned your grandmother and aunt had heart problems. Do you know specifically what those problems were?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother… she had something with her heart rhythm, I think. It wasn’t a heart attack, but she was always tired and short of breath. Ended up needing a pacemaker, eventually. My aunt… it was worse. She had… blockages, I think they said. She had a stent put in, but… she didn’t recover well. It was a few years ago now. My mom doesn’t talk about it much. She gets very upset. Honestly, I’m not sure exactly what happened with either of them. Just that it was… bad. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a starting point. Pacemaker for your grandmother, and a stent for your aunt – that suggests some degree of heart disease in the family. And I understand it’s difficult when family members don’t want to discuss details. Now, let’s talk about you. Have you experienced any symptoms yourself – anything like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I feel… fine. Perfectly normal. That’s why I’m probably wasting your time. I exercise regularly – I run a few times a week – and I eat pretty healthy. I don’t smoke, barely drink. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And occasionally my heart feels like it’s… skipping a beat, but it’s probably just from running. Nothing alarming. Really. I just… want to make sure it stays that way, you know? Preventative maintenance, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Blain. Being proactive and healthy is never a waste of time. The fact that you're active and don't have any current symptoms is very positive. A little "skip" in your heart rhythm after running isn’t necessarily alarming, but it's good you mentioned it. Just to get a complete picture, let’s quickly go through a few other things. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I can take pretty much anything. And no chronic conditions. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. I'm… remarkably healthy, actually. It's frustrating, because my mom treats me like I'm made of glass. She's always telling me to get checked for something or other. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very attentive mother! It’s good she cares, even if it’s a little… overzealous. Okay, no allergies, no chronic conditions. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Right. No medications. Just… vitamins, occasionally. A multivitamin, sometimes, when I remember. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Look, are we going to do a physical exam now? Because honestly, I have a meeting in a couple of hours and I'm starting to get a little anxious about being late. I really don’t want to spend the whole afternoon here if it’s not necessary.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's do a quick physical exam. It will just be the basics – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your pulse. It shouldn't take long. If you could just sit up here for me, and we’ll get started. I'm going to listen to your heart now. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 118/72. Pulse is 68 and regular. Everything sounds and feels good so far, Blain. Your pulse is strong and regular, and your reflexes are normal. Now, I’d like to check your weight and height, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Weight and height, whatever. Just… please be quick. This is really cutting into my day. I’m 181 centimeters tall, roughly six feet. And… I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but I’m probably around 60 kilograms. I’m fairly active, so I don’t weigh much. I'm a bit skinny, if anything. Are we done now? Can we just get a verdict? Am I going to die of a heart attack, or not?
DOCTOR: Okay, 181 centimeters, 60 kilograms. That gives you a BMI of 19.6, which is within the healthy range. Blain, based on what you've told me, the physical exam, and your family history, you appear to be in good health. Your heart sounds strong, your lungs are clear, and your blood pressure is normal. You're active and maintain a healthy weight. However, given your family history of heart problems, I would recommend a baseline EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – just to get a snapshot of your heart’s electrical activity. It’s a simple, painless test, and it can help rule out any underlying issues. It doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem, but it provides a useful starting point. Would you be comfortable with that?
