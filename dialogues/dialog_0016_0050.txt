DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Pavlovec. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My cough. It’s been… a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something stuck in my throat, but there’s nothing there. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been going on for a while. And you feel like something’s stuck, but you don’t see anything when you look?
PATIENT: That’s right. It’s not a bad cough, not like… hacking up anything. Just… irritating. Makes me want to clear my throat all the time. My wife… she used to make me tea for it. But… well, she’s gone now. So, no more tea.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovec. That must be very difficult. Let's focus on this cough for now, and we’ll see if we can get it sorted out. You mentioned it’s mostly dry. Does anything seem to make it worse – like lying down, being cold, or talking?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It’s just… there. Maybe a little worse when I’m doing… things. Like working in the garage. But I’m always working in the garage. I don't know if that makes sense. It just feels… old. Like I’m old, and my cough is old too.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Pavlovec. Working in the garage could definitely be a factor. Do you work with any dust or fumes in there?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Lots of dust. Sanding, grinding… things like that. And sometimes… paint. Used to use a lot of paint. Not so much anymore. My son, he does most of the painting now. I mostly just… fix things. Or try to. Still, plenty of dust. Always dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exposure to dust and potentially paint fumes in the garage. And you said it's been going on for a while, but you're not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: A long while… maybe a year? Or more? It’s hard to say. Time… it slips away. I remember my wife saying something about it, telling me to be careful. But I don’t recall… exactly what she said. She always worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's understandable that it's hard to pinpoint the exact timeframe. Let’s talk about some other things to get a better picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. No chills, no. And… night sweats? What are night sweats? I get warm sometimes, when I’m sleeping. But everyone gets warm, don’t they? I don't think I’ve ever had sweats at night. Just… old man warmth.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Just feeling warm at night, which is common. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing when you cough or exert yourself?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes. But I’m an old man, Doctor! I get winded walking up the stairs. It could just be… age. I don’t know about… wheezing. What does that sound like? I haven’t noticed anything… special. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, but it sounds like you haven’t experienced that. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart… the doctor told me years ago my heart was… strong, for an old man. Lung problems… no, I don't think so. I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I quit. Diabetes… no, never been told that. My wife… she had some trouble with her sugar. But not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you used to smoke but quit, no known lung or heart problems, and no diabetes. And you said your wife had some sugar issues. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not anymore. Used to take something for my knees, a long time ago. But the doctor said it wasn't helping, so I stopped. Now… just a little liniment for my back. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some… what is it called? Something my son buys me. A little white pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, just liniment for your back and a white pill for your arthritis, sometimes. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Not that I recall. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings. But not me. I can eat anything. Or… I used to. My appetite isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen levels, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle. My chest gets a little sore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovec. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. Your lungs have some mild wheezing, especially on exhale. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Your throat looks slightly irritated, but no significant redness or swelling. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you notice your ankles swelling often?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… a lot of things. My ankles… sometimes they swell. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… old age again. I usually put my feet up. Helps a little. It’s always worse when it’s hot.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history of a long-term cough, exposure to dust in the garage, mild wheezing, low oxygen levels, and ankle swelling, I think we need to do a little more investigating. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We'll also do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any underlying infection. Would you be able to get to the lab for a blood draw today?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and blood tests? Oh dear. Sounds serious. I… I don’t know about going to the lab today. I don't drive anymore. My son… he might be able to take me. But he’s busy. How important is it? And… what are you looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Pavlovec. The tests aren't necessarily indicating something serious, but they will help us understand what's going on and ensure we get you the right treatment. The chest X-ray will help us look for any signs of lung disease, like COPD or pneumonia. The blood test will check your kidney function, as ankle swelling can sometimes indicate kidney problems, and rule out any infection. It would be best to get these done as soon as possible, ideally within the next few days. If your son is unavailable, we can explore other options to get you to the lab, such as a medical transport service. Would you like me to look into that for you?
PATIENT: Oh… medical transport? That sounds… expensive. I don’t have insurance, you see. My wife… she took care of all that. I really don’t want to bother my son if I can avoid it. Maybe… maybe I could wait a day or two and see if my son has some free time. Is that alright? It’s just… everything feels so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and not wanting to burden your son, Mr. Pavlovec. We can definitely wait a day or two to see if your son is available. However, I do want to emphasize that it's important to get these tests done sooner rather than later to rule out any serious problems. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It won't cure the problem, but it should provide some relief from your cough and wheezing. Also, I’ll give you a list of resources for low-cost or free medical care in the area, just in case. And if your cough worsens or you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good, Doctor. An inhaler… that’s something I can manage. And a list of resources… that would be very helpful. I appreciate that. I really do. My wife… she always knew what to do. Thank you for being so patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. I’m happy to help in any way I can. And please, don’t apologize for being an “old man.” You deserve the best possible care, and I’m here to provide it. Here’s the prescription for the inhaler, and this list of resources. The pharmacy is just down the street, and they can answer any questions you have about the medication. Please call my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get these tests scheduled as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. You've been very kind. I… I just hope this isn’t anything too serious. I'll go get the inhaler now. And… I’ll ask my son about the tests. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll be in touch soon to schedule those tests.
