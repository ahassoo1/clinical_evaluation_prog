DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but when it does, it scares me a little. They told me… at the hospital… it was something about… uh… atrial… something? I don’t remember all the big words.
DOCTOR: Okay, “atrial something”... sounds like you were discharged with a diagnosis, or suspicion of, atrial fibrillation, or AFib. It's a common irregular heartbeat. And it can be scary. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say it feels "funny", can you describe that sensation more specifically?
PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Yes, that sounds right… atrial… something. It’s like… a fast flapping, inside my chest. Not pain, exactly. More… a rushing feeling? And sometimes, I feel… short of breath when it happens. Not bad short of breath, just… like I need to take a bigger breath. It lasts maybe a minute, maybe less. Then it stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, fast flapping, rushing sensation, and some shortness of breath. How often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say. Not every day. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes not for a few weeks at a time. Last time was… let me think… maybe four days ago? I was walking up the hill to the store, and it started then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do anything specific seem to trigger it, besides walking uphill?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. I drink coffee in the morning, but I always have. And I try not to get too… worked up about things. Stress, you know? But… it happens sometimes even when I'm feeling calm.
DOCTOR: Okay. And before this started happening, would you say your heart felt normal?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Always. I never had any problems before this. I work hard, but… I’m strong. I never thought anything was wrong with my heart. It just… started happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some other things quickly, just to get a full picture. Any chest pain at all with these episodes, even a mild discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Never. Just the fast flapping, and the feeling like I need to breathe a little harder. It’s mostly… worrying. It’s scary when your heart feels like it’s not doing what it’s supposed to.
DOCTOR: I understand that completely. Okay. Any dizziness or lightheadedness when this happens?
PATIENT: Sometimes, maybe. A little bit. Not enough to fall down or anything. Just… a little wobbly feeling. Like I might lose my balance for a second. It goes away when the fast flapping stops.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to work through things. But this… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any family history of heart problems – parents, siblings, anyone?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But he didn’t have any problems with his heart, not that I know of. My mother… she was healthy, very healthy. Never sick a day in her life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No. Never had any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll talk about what might be going on and what we should do next. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the table here. I’ll grab my stethoscope. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Your pulse is irregularly irregular – that confirms what you’ve been describing. I also hear a slight murmur. I'm going to feel your extremities to check your pulses. Your pulses are good and strong. Now, I'd like to order an EKG to get a better picture of your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check your thyroid function and electrolytes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Uh… an EKG? Is that… painful? And blood tests… I don’t like needles very much. But… if it helps, I guess. Is the murmur… bad? You said it was slight… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: No, an EKG is not painful at all. It's completely non-invasive – we just place some sticky pads on your chest to measure the electrical signals. And I understand your concern about needles. We'll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. As for the murmur… it’s a sound your heart makes. Many murmurs are harmless – it doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem. But we need to investigate further to be sure. The EKG and blood tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to address as well. Do you agree to get these tests done?
PATIENT: Okay… no pain, that’s good. And it’s just to be sure… that’s good too. Yes, Doctor, I agree. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s happening and what I can do to feel better. Where do we do these tests? Do I need to make an appointment somewhere?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a referral for an EKG and blood work at the lab just down the street - 123 Main Street. They’re open until 5 PM today, and you don’t need an appointment. Just bring this referral form with you, and your insurance information. Since you mentioned you're uninsured, we’ll see what options are available for financial assistance at the lab. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, and if you feel these palpitations happening, try to sit down and relax. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No caffeine… that will be hard! But I can try. And I will try to relax. What if… what if it’s something serious, Doctor? Will you… will you help me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, I understand your concern. It's natural to be worried. And yes, absolutely, I will help you. That's my job. We're going to take this one step at a time. We'll get the test results back, and then we'll discuss all your options. If it is something serious, we'll work together to find the best possible treatment. I’ll be with you every step of the way. Is there anything else on your mind right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve made me feel a little better already. Just knowing someone is trying to help… that means a lot. I’ll go do the tests now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. That’s good to hear. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. We’ll be in touch to schedule that appointment once the results are available. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
