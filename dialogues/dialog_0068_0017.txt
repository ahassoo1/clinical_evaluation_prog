DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well... it’s about this... thing. A tryout. For a team. I think. It's... sports, you know? My… someone told me I needed this check-up before I could... participate. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I don’t remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-participation physical. Yes, that makes sense. Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Very fuzzy. It was… my nephew, I believe. He was very insistent. Said it was important. A good thing, he called it. I mostly just… do what I’m told these days. Though, honestly, at my age… participating feels a little… ambitious. But, you know, gotta keep moving, right? Though I can’t recall what I’m moving towards exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to feel that way. Let's try to get a clearer picture. So, this is for a sports team… do you recall what kind of sport it is?
PATIENT: Now that is a good question. A very good question. Hmm… balls, I think? Round balls. Maybe… orange? Or brown? It involved running, definitely running. And… other people. It wasn’t… golf. Definitely not golf. Too much quiet. This was… louder. More shouting. Oh, and uniforms. Yes! Definitely uniforms. Blue, maybe? Or red? It's all… mixed up, Doctor. I apologize. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize, Mr. Bartok. We’ll work through it. Round balls, running, uniforms… Okay. Let's start with your general health. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell? Well… I get tired, of course. That's just… getting older, isn't it? And my knees… they make noises. Lots of noises. Like… little pops. And sometimes a crack. Not a bad crack, mind you, just… noticeable. But I’ve always had those noises. It's just… more frequent, perhaps. I wouldn't say "unwell," exactly. More… worn. Like an old shoe. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Bartok. Worn, like an old shoe. Okay. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not that I recall. Sometimes a little heartburn, but that's just the… spicy food. My ex-wife always said I ate too much spice. Shortness of breath? Only when I try to climb the stairs too fast. Which I don't do often. Dizziness… maybe a little when I stand up quickly. But I just hold onto something. It’s not a problem, problem. Just… a little wobbly. Nothing a good sit-down can’t fix. I don’t faint. Definitely don’t faint. That would be… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll take a look at your vital signs, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to get a better understanding of things. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Hmm. Exam, you say? Well… I suppose. As long as it’s quick. I have… things to do. Not important things, mind you, but… commitments. Listening to my heart and lungs… that sounds… thorough. And the knees… yes, they’re definitely the problem area. But quick, Doctor. Please. I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I'll be as quick as possible. Please, have a seat here. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Alright, just relax your arm for me… 130 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Not bad. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Sounds clear, no wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: Clear, you say? That's… good. I always thought I had a bit of a rattle in my chest, but… you’re the doctor. So, clear. Fine. So, what about these knees? Are they as bad as they feel? They’ve been giving me trouble for years, you know. Especially after… well, after things. After the divorce. Everything just seemed to ache more then. Though, I suppose that wasn’t the knees, was it? Still… they hurt.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There’s some tenderness here on the medial side of both knees. And some mild swelling. Can you bend these for me?
PATIENT: Ugh. Oh, that’s… not pleasant. Yes, definitely not pleasant. It feels… stiff. Like rusty hinges. And… pop. Did you hear that pop? It's always that pop. It's a very unsettling pop. And… ouch. Just a little twinge. But definitely a twinge. Not bad enough to… stop me, mind you, but… noticeable. Are you seeing this on… whatever machine you're looking at? It's probably very obvious, isn’t it? They're quite bad, these knees. Quite bad indeed.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m seeing some crepitus—that’s the popping and grinding you're feeling—and there is some limited range of motion. Stability seems intact, but there’s definitely some discomfort with flexion. It appears you have some osteoarthritis in both knees. This is quite common, especially with age and activity. Now, have you noticed any locking, giving way, or instability in your knees?
PATIENT: Locking… no. Not locking. Though, sometimes they just… stick. For a moment. Like they’re glued together. And then they… pop. Giving way… no, I wouldn’t say giving way. I’m a sturdy man, Doctor. I don’t give way. Though… once, after that softball game, I did stumble a bit. But that was probably just the heat. And instability… hmm. They feel… wobbly sometimes. Especially when I go down the stairs. But I hold onto the railing. Always the railing. So, not completely unstable. Just… cautious. Is that what you mean? Cautious? Because I am a cautious man. Especially with these knees.
DOCTOR: Cautious, yes. That's a good way to put it. Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it does sound like you’re dealing with osteoarthritis in both knees. We also need to consider your history of fatigue and the vague recollection of a sports tryout. Do you recall any other medical conditions you have, any surgeries, or medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. Medical conditions… well, my ex-wife always said I had a stubborn streak. Is that a medical condition? Surgeries… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… maybe an appendix? I’m really not sure. Medications… let me see. I take something for my… well, for something. A little white pill. Every morning. It helps me… function. I think. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… a mess. I apologize. It’s probably very frustrating for you. I really should write these things down. But I never seem to get around to it. Is it important? The little white pill, I mean?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bartok. We'll do our best. The little white pill is important. Do you know the name of it, or what it’s for?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. I really don't. It came in a… orange bottle, I think. With a white cap. And… little pills. It’s for my… pressure, maybe? Or my cholesterol? I honestly can’t recall. My nephew handles most of that now. He fills the bottles and tells me what to take. I just… take it. He says it’s important for my health. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm just going through the motions these days. One pill, one appointment, one… whatever this tryout is. It’s all a bit… hazy. Is it alright if I just… leave it to my nephew? He's very organized. Much more organized than me.
DOCTOR: While I understand, it’s important for me to have an accurate medication list. We can try to contact your nephew to find out, if you'd like. If not, we can proceed, but it would be helpful to have that information. For now, let’s focus on your knees. It sounds like they’re causing you significant discomfort. Given your fatigue and the hazy recollection of this tryout, I recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions contributing to your fatigue. Second, I suggest a referral to a physical therapist for evaluation and treatment of your knees. And third, I recommend discussing this tryout with your primary care physician to ensure it's safe for you. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… does sound reasonable. Blood work, physical therapy… yes. And talking to my doctor… good idea. I suppose it’s better to be safe. My nephew will be pleased to hear you suggest that. He worries about me, you know. A very good nephew. So, blood work and physical therapy… and a chat with my doctor. Are there any forms I need to fill out? I’m quite good at signing my name, if that’s helpful. But the writing… not so much. And… this tryout… should I cancel it? It all seems a bit… much, now that I think about it. Perhaps I’m just too old for all this running around.
DOCTOR: I’ll have my assistant provide you with the necessary forms for the blood work and the physical therapy referral. And as for the tryout… that’s entirely up to you. It’s perfectly fine to postpone or cancel it if you feel it’s not the right time. Your health is the most important thing. We'll get these referrals sent over, and I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the blood work results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds perfect, Doctor. Blood work results, follow-up appointment… yes. And the forms. My assistant will be very helpful. She's very efficient. Much more efficient than me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient. I apologize for being so… hazy. It’s just… everything is a bit of a blur these days. I suppose that’s what happens when you get older. But thank you. Really. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. It’s my job to help. Don't worry about being hazy, we’ll figure things out. If anything comes up before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and try not to overdo it.
