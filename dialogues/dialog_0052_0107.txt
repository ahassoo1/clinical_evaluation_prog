DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My heart… it feels like it’s jumping sometimes. Not always, but it happens. It’s a weird feeling, like a fish flapping. That’s why I come.
DOCTOR: I understand. A fluttering sensation in your chest – that’s certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Not when I work hard. When I sit. Or maybe when I eat… big meal. Not small. And sometimes… just when I am. You know… being. Not doing anything special. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to happen both at rest and after eating a larger meal, and sometimes without any obvious trigger. It’s good that you’ve noticed it doesn’t cause you pain, but it’s still important to find out what’s causing this sensation. How long has this been happening, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Maybe… six months? I don’t know exactly. It started slow. First, just once a week. Now… maybe two, three times a week. Sometimes more if I eat too much sweet things. Like baklava. My wife makes good baklava.
DOCTOR: That sounds delicious, and I appreciate you sharing that detail. Knowing the frequency and any potential triggers like sweets is very helpful. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this fluttering sensation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little tired. Not like sick tired, just… more tired than usual. And maybe a little… short of breath. But I smoke, so maybe that? I try to stop, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Puder. It's important to consider all possibilities. The fatigue and shortness of breath are good things to mention, and it’s certainly important to address the smoking. Before we discuss that further, let’s go through some other basic questions. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… my father had that. He take pills for it. Diabetes? No, not that I know. Heart problems… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had something. He had operation. Long time ago. I don’t remember what kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension in your father and a cardiac procedure in your maternal uncle. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. Except when my son born. My wife, she go to hospital. I go with her. But me, no hospital. I break my arm when I was little boy, but that small thing. Doctor fix it, no big deal.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No medicines. Except sometimes… I take something for my stomach. It burn sometimes. But not all the time. Just when I eat spicy food. My wife, she give it to me. I don’t know the name.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. My wife always worry I eat too much, but I’m okay. I never get sick from food. Never.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Puder. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s good. I trust you, Doctor. Listen to my heart. See what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. I’m listening to your heart now. I can hear a slightly rapid rhythm, but no obvious murmurs or irregularities at this time. Your lungs sound clear, but I do detect some mild wheezing. Your blood pressure is elevated at 148/92. Your pulse is a bit fast, and your extremities appear normal. Based on this preliminary examination, your heart rate and blood pressure are somewhat elevated, and there is some mild wheezing in your lungs. The symptoms you’ve described, combined with these findings, suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to your smoking, anxiety, or a potential cardiac issue. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some tests. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests? Okay. If you think it’s good. What kind of tests? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Mr. Puder. We’ll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. I’d like to order a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Finally, given the wheezing I detected, I think a chest X-ray would be helpful to rule out any lung issues. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood, okay. EKG, okay. X-ray… that’s with the machine? Not scary?
DOCTOR: Yes, an X-ray uses a machine to take a picture of your chest. It's a very quick and painless procedure, and it doesn't involve any needles or injections. You'll simply stand or sit in front of the machine while a technician takes the images. The technician will ensure you are properly shielded to minimize any radiation exposure. It’s a standard diagnostic tool and very safe. I’ll write the orders for these tests now. Do you have insurance that covers these procedures?
PATIENT: No insurance. No money for that. I work, but not much money. Just enough for food and rent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Puder. Lack of insurance can make things difficult. Let me see what resources are available to us. We have a financial assistance program that may be able to help cover the cost of these tests. I will also speak with the lab and radiology department to see if they offer any reduced rates or payment plans. In the meantime, it’s important to address your elevated blood pressure. I recommend starting some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your salt intake, exercising regularly, and managing your stress. I also strongly advise you to try and quit smoking. I can provide you with resources to help with that as well. Would you be open to discussing these options while we work on getting the tests arranged?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Lifestyle… what does that mean? Less salt? I like salty food. And stress… my wife says I worry too much. And smoking… it’s hard. Very hard.
DOCTOR: Lifestyle modifications simply mean making small changes to your daily habits to improve your overall health. Reducing your salt intake can help lower your blood pressure. It doesn’t mean eliminating it completely, but being mindful of how much you consume. Exercise can also be very beneficial, even just a 30-minute walk each day. As for stress, there are various techniques you can try, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or spending time doing things you enjoy. And you’re right, quitting smoking is incredibly difficult. It’s a very addictive habit. We have resources available, including support groups and medications that can help you manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. I can also refer you to a smoking cessation specialist if you’d like. Let’s start with the basics. I’ll write a referral for a smoking cessation program and some information on healthy eating and stress management. Would you be willing to try and cut back on your smoking gradually, starting today?
PATIENT: Gradually… okay. Maybe I smoke one less cigarette each day? My wife would be happy. She always tell me to stop.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent starting point, Mr. Puder. Cutting back by one cigarette each day is a very achievable goal. Remember, even small changes can make a big difference. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to check your progress and discuss the results of your tests, once we’ve arranged them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You help me a lot, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're in this together. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions along the way. Here are the referrals and information packets I’ve prepared for you. The nurse will be with you shortly to review them and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care. .
