DOCTOR: Hi Waleed, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… for a life insurance thing. They need me to get a check-up, you know, for the paperwork. I just need to get it done, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Waleed. A lot of insurance companies require a physical exam as part of the application process. No problem at all, we can definitely get that done for you today. So, this is mainly just a routine check-up to satisfy the insurance requirements, or are you having any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just the insurance thing. I’m… mostly okay, I guess. Nothing major bothering me. I try to stay active, walk around a bit. That's about it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Even just staying active is a great start. Okay, well, let’s go through some basic information to get things started. I see here you’re 49 years old, and your height and weight are listed as 174 centimeters and 97 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. About right, yeah. I haven’t… really checked in a while, to be honest. But those numbers feel about right.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. And you mentioned you’re insured through Medicare, is that still current?
PATIENT: Yep, still got Medicare. Haven’t had any problems with it. It's... what I've got. Everything’s been okay so far.
DOCTOR: Great. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. Never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… try to stay healthy, you know? No prescriptions or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. I had… chickenpox as a kid, I think? And a couple of broken bones when I was younger, playing sports. But nothing serious, nothing that needed… long-term care or anything. I don’t really have a list of illnesses. I hope that makes sense. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Waleed. Many people don't have extensive medical histories, and that’s perfectly alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Nope. Nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Never needed anything cut open or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom, she had… some heart trouble when she was older. And my dad, he had diabetes. But that was a long time ago. I'm not sure exactly what kind, to be honest. And that was back on the islands, so… it’s hard to remember details. I don’t really know much about it. They're… both gone now. Sorry, getting a little sad.
DOCTOR: I understand, Waleed. It’s alright to feel that way, and it’s perfectly okay if you don’t have all the details. It’s good you remember anything at all. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a quick physical exam. Can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What does that mean? I… I mostly just work and try to relax. I don’t really… go out much. I used to, when I was younger. But not really anymore. I don't drink much, maybe a beer sometimes. And I… I used to smoke, but I quit a long time ago. Like, twenty years ago, at least. Does that make sense? Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Waleed. That's exactly the kind of information I was looking for. Okay, so you've quit smoking for about 20 years, that’s excellent! And you only drink occasionally. Now, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I’m a lodging manager. I work at a… a small hotel, kinda out in the country. It’s mostly paperwork and making sure everything runs smoothly. Not very exciting. Long hours though. That’s about it. Pretty much just work, then come home and sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, lodging manager, that sounds like it can be demanding. Long hours can be tough. Alright, well, it sounds like we have a good overview of your history. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Just… let’s get it over with, if you don’t mind. I got things I need to do later. Just… quick is good.
DOCTOR: Of course, Waleed. We’ll keep it quick and efficient. If you could just sit up there for me, and I'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Just… hurry it up a little, if you could? I'm… kinda busy.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 92. That's a little elevated, Waleed. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some slight wheezing in your lungs. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. Never been diagnosed with asthma. I do get a little… short of breath sometimes, when I walk up hills, maybe? But I figured it was just… being out of shape. I don't take any medicine for it. I just… slow down. It's been happening for a while, I guess. But it’s never been anything… serious. I thought it was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. It could be a number of things, and it's good you've been aware of it. Now, let’s just take a look at your throat and ears. Open wide for me, please… Your throat looks clear. And your ears look clear as well. Alright, that completes the physical exam. We'll get some blood work done just to get a better baseline and check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. It’s a standard part of a check-up like this, especially for insurance purposes.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work. Fine. Just… tell me where to go to get it done, and let’s get this over with. I gotta get back to work soon, you know? The hotel… it doesn't run itself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Waleed. Here’s a lab requisition form. The nearest lab is at Rural General Hospital, about ten minutes from here. They’re open until 5 PM today. Just take this form with you, and they’ll take care of it. You don't need an appointment. Do you have any questions about getting the blood work done?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… go to the hospital, give them this paper, get the blood taken. Got it. Is that all? Can I go now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. I’ll have the nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Just to be clear, the elevated blood pressure and slight wheezing are things we want to keep an eye on. I'm recommending lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – and we'll see how the blood work looks. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I’m good. Just… don’t wanna worry about too much stuff right now. Just get the blood work done, and let’s see what it says. Okay. Thanks, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Waleed. You’re welcome. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. And again, if you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room. .
