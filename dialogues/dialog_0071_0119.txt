DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jinnie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather…awkward, to put it mildly. It’s about a…problem. A personal problem, really. I don’t usually discuss such things, you understand. It’s just…there’s a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. It’s not my discharge, of course. It’s…a gentleman friend’s. A new one.
DOCTOR: Right. I understand it can be…sensitive to discuss. No need to be embarrassed, Jinnie. We're here to figure things out. So, this gentleman friend… is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent? Yes, quite. As I said, new gentleman friend. We haven’t…well, it hasn’t been long. A few weeks, perhaps. Honestly, Doctor, at my age, one doesn’t expect these sorts of…complications. It’s terribly inconvenient. And rather unromantic, wouldn’t you agree? Is it something serious? I hope it’s not…catching.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It’s good you're thinking about these things. “Catching,” as you say, is a reasonable worry, and we will definitely address that. To help me understand, can you describe the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Must I? It’s…not pleasant. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And…thickish. Not watery, thankfully. There's a smell, naturally, but I’ve tried not to get too close to investigate. It's just…unseemly. Is that helpful? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a medical professional. I don’t have the vocabulary for these things. And frankly, I find the whole topic distasteful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Jinnie. Thank you. “Yellowish and thickish” gives me a starting point. And you’re not expected to be a medical professional, absolutely. Do you know if he's experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than this…affliction? Well, he says he feels a bit of…burning. When he…uses the facilities, naturally. And a general feeling of…discomfort. Though men are so stoic, aren’t they? One can never be sure if they’re exaggerating. He’s not one to complain, generally. Though I did hear him grumbling about it being…irritating. Is that important? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just trying to be helpful. I’m not a detective.
DOCTOR: “Burning” is definitely important, Jinnie. And irritation too. It sounds like this could be a few things. Has he had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Goodness no! This is a new development, as I've said repeatedly. He’s a…respectable man. Not the type to have…these sorts of problems. He’s always been very…particular about his hygiene. I find it rather concerning, to be frank. It makes one wonder about his past, doesn't it? Though I suppose I shouldn’t pry. It’s just…unsettling. Are you thinking it's something…serious, Doctor? I really don’t have time for a lengthy illness. I have a book club meeting next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, new and concerning. I understand your concern about time commitments, Jinnie. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about his medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor. I barely know what he had for breakfast. He’s not a man who volunteers information, you understand. He’s rather private. But… let me think. He mentioned, in passing, having had the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… that sort of thing. And a bout of…appendicitis, many years ago. Beyond that… I truly don’t know. He’s not one to discuss ailments. Are you going to need a full life story? Because I’m afraid I don’t have it.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Jinnie. Measles, mumps, appendicitis… good to know. And no worries about a full life story. Knowing he's generally healthy is a start. Now, has he ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you implying…? I should hope not! That is a rather…indelicate question! He’s a gentleman! A respectable gentleman! To even suggest such a thing is…outrageous! I find that deeply offensive, frankly. I will not answer that question. It’s simply not appropriate. Are you accusing him of something? Because if you are…!
DOCTOR: Please, Jinnie, I apologize if my question was insensitive. It was not my intention to offend or imply anything. It’s a routine question when investigating a discharge, simply to rule out possibilities. I understand your discomfort, and we don't have to discuss it further. I just want to ensure we get to the bottom of this and provide the best care. Perhaps we should focus on whether he's experiencing any other symptoms, like pain, fever, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, that's slightly better. Though frankly, the entire conversation has been rather unpleasant. Pain…he did mention a slight discomfort, as I said earlier. And perhaps a bit of…lassitude. He’s been rather quiet lately, now that you mention it. But he’s also been preoccupied with his stamp collection, so it’s hard to say. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a medical detective. I'm simply trying to be helpful. Is there anything you can do, or are we just going to sit here discussing his private ailments all afternoon? I have a hair appointment, you know. And a book club meeting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jinnie. And I apologize for the length of this discussion. Based on what you've told me – the yellowish, thick discharge, the burning sensation, the discomfort, and some fatigue – it could be a few things. It sounds like he might have an infection, possibly a sexually transmitted one, but we can’t know for sure without a proper examination and some tests. I strongly recommend he see a doctor for a full evaluation. I can provide a referral to a urologist, or he can see his primary care physician. They'll likely want to do a urine test and possibly a swab to identify the cause of the discharge. Would you like me to write a referral?
PATIENT: A referral…yes, I suppose so. Though honestly, the thought of him going to a doctor…he’s a rather private man, you understand. But it’s better than sitting here discussing it all afternoon, I suppose. Just…make it discreet, please. And perhaps suggest a doctor who is…understanding. Someone who won't ask too many…indelicate questions. And please, no mention of sexually transmitted anything. It would be terribly embarrassing. Just a simple…infection, if you please. Is that possible? I have a book club meeting, you know. And a hair appointment. And frankly, I’m quite exhausted from all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I will write a referral to a discreet and understanding urologist, and I will simply mention a possible infection in the notes. No need to mention anything further without his consent. Here is the referral information. Please encourage him to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
