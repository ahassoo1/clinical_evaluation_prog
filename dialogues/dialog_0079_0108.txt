DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but… well, things came up. I’ve been… bleeding. From down there. It’s not… pleasant. And it’s been going on for a few days now. Not a good look, honestly.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. For a few days. Alright. And can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It's blood, coming from my… rear end. Is that specific enough for you? It's not like I’m enjoying detailing this, you know. And it’s not just a little bit, either. It's enough to… well, you get the picture. I had to change my clothes twice yesterday. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “from the rear end” is… helpful, thank you. And you mentioned it required changing clothes twice yesterday. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not constant. It comes in waves, I guess. Especially after… well, after using the bathroom. And when I try to… push. You know. It’s… worse then. Not that I'm running a marathon or anything, but even just a little… effort. It's embarrassing. Look, I don't need a lecture, alright? Just tell me what's wrong.
DOCTOR: No lecture, Mr. Gentz. I assure you. It sounds as though it is exacerbated by bowel movements, and perhaps straining. Have you noticed any pain associated with this bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, some. Not like a sharp, stabbing pain, more of a… pressure. A dull ache, mostly. And a bit of cramping. It's uncomfortable, to say the least. I thought maybe it was something I ate, but it hasn’t gone away. I really don’t understand what’s going on. It’s just… frustrating. And messy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any change in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Change? What kind of change? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. I’m not a baby, I don’t keep a log of things. It’s… you know. Solid, usually. Sometimes a bit loose, depending on what I eat. But nothing dramatically different. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated here. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I’m simply trying to gather information, Mr. Gentz. It’s necessary to determine the cause of the bleeding. Have you noticed any blood in your stool other than what you’ve already described?
PATIENT: Other than… the obvious? You mean like, black, tarry stuff? No. Not that I’ve seen. It’s… red. Bright red, mostly. Which is why I'm here, honestly. It’s not like I’m ignoring something minor. It's a concerning amount of blood, and it's been going on long enough that I figured I should probably get it checked out. I'm not an idiot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Gentz, it sounds as though you are experiencing rectal bleeding, and given the location and the fact it’s bright red, it's likely originating relatively close to the anus. However, we need to determine the cause. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: A physical examination? You mean… down there? Look, I really don’t like the sound of that. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe a test? I’m just not comfortable with someone poking around. It’s… a sensitive area, obviously.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a digital rectal exam is often the quickest and most direct way to identify the source of the bleeding. It is a standard procedure. Without it, I’m essentially guessing. We could order a stool test, but that won’t tell us where the bleeding is coming from. It will only confirm the presence of blood. I understand your discomfort, but I assure you it is a necessary step. It will be brief, and I will explain everything as I go. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Brief? You keep saying brief. Look, I haven't had anyone poking around down there in… well, a long time. And frankly, the idea isn’t appealing. Is this absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we start with the stool test? Just to rule things out? And what exactly are we looking for? Don't just tell me it's "standard procedure". I want details.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, the stool test, while it can confirm the presence of blood, won’t pinpoint the source. We are looking for potential causes such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or, less commonly, something more serious. While hemorrhoids are often the culprit, we cannot rule out other possibilities without a physical examination. It is a matter of responsible medical practice. I understand your apprehension, but delaying a proper examination could potentially delay a diagnosis. I assure you I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If it makes you more comfortable, I can explain the procedure in more detail. We can also discuss alternative specialists if you prefer a different physician to conduct the exam. However, some form of examination is necessary. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Just… people poking around. Look, alright. Fine. But you better be quick. And gentle. Like you said. And explain everything. Don't just… do things. I don’t want any surprises. And no judgment, alright? This is embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. No judgment, I assure you. I understand this is uncomfortable. I will explain each step as I go, and we will proceed at your pace. First, I’ll need you to lie on your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will apply a lubricant to the area, and then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. I will be feeling for any abnormalities – masses, tenderness, or the source of the bleeding. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any pain. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Questions? Just… how long is this going to take? And what if you find something? Don't tell me it's nothing, just… be honest. I don't need sugarcoating. Just tell me what it is, alright? And… could I have a glass of water afterwards? This is making my mouth dry.
DOCTOR: The examination itself should only take a few moments, Mr. Gentz – perhaps thirty seconds to a minute. As for what I might find… well, as I mentioned, it could be hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, or something else entirely. If I do find anything concerning, I will discuss it with you in detail and recommend further testing or specialist referral. I will be honest with you, Mr. Gentz. If there is anything to be concerned about, we will address it. The water is there for when we’re finished. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a few more moments to consider?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. But be gentle. Seriously. And explain what you're doing as you go. Don’t just… poke around in silence.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie on your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I'm going to apply some lubricant to my gloved finger. This will make the examination more comfortable. I will then gently insert my finger into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities. It may feel like you need to have a bowel movement, but that is normal. Remember, please let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. This will help me adjust the examination accordingly. Here we go…
