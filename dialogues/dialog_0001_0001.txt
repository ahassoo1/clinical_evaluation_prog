DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. It is… well, it is about the cigarettes. I’ve been smoking for a very long time, you see. Perhaps too long. I’m hoping you can assist me in… stopping.
DOCTOR: Right. Cigarettes. Look, Mr. Knoch, I've heard it all before. How long is "a very long time," exactly?
PATIENT: Sixty-two years, Doctor. Sixty-two years, starting when I was twelve. My older brother, he introduced me. He… he passed away some years ago now, lung cancer. It was… unpleasant. I started when we were boys, sneaking them behind the barn. It's a habit, really. A terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two years… that’s… considerable. And you’ve tried to quit before, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Patches, gum… even those… what are they called? The little inhalers. They tasted awful. And the willpower, you see, that’s the hardest part. I’d manage a few days, sometimes a week, but then… something would happen. A bit of stress, or a social gathering… and I’d be back at it. It’s like a… a comfort, if that makes sense. A bad comfort, of course.
DOCTOR: Comfort. Right. Look, Mr. Knoch, with that length of history, you’re likely dealing with some… significant physiological dependence. And honestly, at your age, we need to be thinking about more than just the nicotine. Let's get a quick look at your lungs, just to see where we stand. Have you had any coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit of coughing, particularly in the mornings. And… well, walking upstairs, I find myself a little breathless more often than I used to. It used to be nothing, but now… it requires a pause, you see. Not terrible, but noticeable. I haven’t mentioned it to anyone, really. Thought it was just… getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s listen to your chest, and I’ll take a look at your oxygen saturation. Nothing fancy, just a quick assessment. If you could just sit up there for me, please. And breathe deeply when I tell you.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m not fond of doctors, you understand. Not that you’ve done anything, of course. It’s just… bad news usually follows, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, your oxygen saturation is… on the lower end of normal. And I do hear some diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. It’s not surprising, given the smoking history. We'll need to rule out any COPD or other lung issues. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. And no… significant conditions. A touch of arthritis in my knees, but nothing that requires any… treatment, really. Just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. I’ve always been a relatively healthy man, aside from the cigarettes, of course. This X-ray… is it going to be unpleasant?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be unpleasant. You just stand still for a few seconds. Look, Mr. Knoch, I’m going to be blunt. With your history, we need to be realistic. Quitting now is important, but we also need to understand the extent of the damage. I’m also going to refer you to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, for a more thorough evaluation. I'll have my assistant schedule those appointments for you. And honestly, I'd recommend talking to someone about the psychological aspect of quitting, too. It's not just a physical addiction. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Not insured. It became… too expensive, after I retired. It is… a predicament. So, a specialist… and an X-ray… even without insurance? Will that be… costly? I have some savings, but… I’m not certain how far they will stretch. And I appreciate you being… blunt, Doctor. I prefer honesty, even if it is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knoch, I’m going to be honest with you. Without insurance, those tests and a specialist visit will be expensive. I can give you a list of places that offer financial assistance, but I can’t guarantee anything. Honestly, at your age and with your history, even quitting now may not fully reverse the damage. I’m not trying to be discouraging, but we need to be practical. I can prescribe some nicotine replacement therapy, but it’s unlikely to be a miracle cure. I’ll have my assistant print out the information for you. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: A miracle cure, no. I don’t expect miracles. But I want to try, Doctor. I’ve smoked for sixty-two years, and I want to spend what time I have not coughing and breathless. Financial assistance, yes, please. And perhaps… a list of support groups? Something… something to help with the… habit, you see. It’s more than just the nicotine. I’ve tried to quit before, and it was the… the loneliness of it that was the hardest part. I understand it may not be easy. But I want to try. And I want your help, if you are willing to give it.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I'll have my assistant print out information on financial assistance programs, pulmonary rehabilitation, and some local support groups. I’m not a miracle worker, Mr. Knoch, but I can provide you with resources. I’ll also put in a referral to the pulmonologist. Expect a call from the office to schedule the appointments. Just… manage your expectations. And I strongly advise you to avoid any further smoking in the meantime. Next patient.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you… for your time. I will… try my best. .
