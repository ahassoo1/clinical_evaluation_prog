DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my…well, it’s about what comes out the back end, Doctor. Blood, you see. Streaked. Not a good sign, is it? I've lived 88 years, I think I’d know what’s normal and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: I understand. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate. “Streaked,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, streaked. Bright red. Not just a little, mind you. Enough to make a fella worry. I didn’t eat anything red, if that’s what you’re thinking. I’m a sensible man, I am. Keep to a proper diet, mostly. Though I did have a bit of beetroot last week… but that wasn’t today. It’s been a few days now.
DOCTOR: Beetroot can sometimes cause discoloration, as you mentioned, but if it’s been several days and you’ve ruled out dietary causes… alright. Can you describe the frequency of this occurring?
PATIENT: Frequency? Goodness. Let me think… It’s not every time, not like a constant flow, you understand. Maybe… three times now? Over the past week. Each time it surprised me, I’ll tell you that. I don't usually look, if you catch my drift, but this was… noticeable. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Three times in the past week. And you say it’s bright red blood, not dark or tarry?
PATIENT: Bright red. Like… well, like you’d expect blood to look, I suppose. Not black or… mushy. Definitely not mushy. Look, Doctor, I'm not one for details when it comes to these… bodily functions. It’s there, it's red, and it's not right. It's making me nervous, if I’m honest. I’ve always been regular, you see. Always. And this just throws everything off.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll need to get a better understanding of what might be causing this. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea – or any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I eat well enough, though my daughter keeps telling me I should cut back. She worries too much. Pain… well, a little discomfort now and then, but nothing major. Old age, you know. A few aches and groans. It's not a sharp pain, not like a stomach bug. It's just… a general feeling of being unsettled, if that makes sense. Bowels… mostly the same, actually. Not overly loose, not blocked up either. Just… normal, mostly. Except for this, of course.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I am 88, Doctor. A fella gets tired, naturally. I don’t run marathons, you know. Shortness of breath… perhaps a little more than usual when I climb the stairs, but I’ve always puffed a bit. It’s probably just the age. It's hard to tell what’s “normal” when you’re this old. Everything aches, everything’s slow… I'm not exactly a spring chicken, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. We’ll start with your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a rectal exam, Mr. Rowbottom. It's necessary to get a better assessment of the situation. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Really, Doctor? At my age? Must you? It’s undignified, you know. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. I don't much like the idea of it, but I want to get to the bottom of this, literally and figuratively. Just… try to be quick about it, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course. It will be as quick and discreet as possible. Please lie down on your left side, knees drawn up. I’ll explain what I'm doing as I go. Abdomen is soft, no significant tenderness to palpation. Some mild guarding, likely age-related. External hemorrhoids present. Palpation reveals no obvious masses. Small amount of occult blood noted on glove. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. The exam revealed some external hemorrhoids and a small amount of blood. This could be the source of the streaking you’ve been experiencing. However, given your age and the fact that this is a new symptom, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a fecal occult blood test and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids, you say? Well, that’s… comforting, I suppose. Though I’ve never had them before. So it’s not something serious? Not… internal? A test, alright. The sooner we know, the better. Just tell me plainly, Doctor, if it's something I need to worry about, alright? No sugarcoating. I’ve lived a long life, but I’d like to keep living it, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: While hemorrhoids are a common cause of rectal bleeding, Mr. Rowbottom, it’s crucial to determine if this is the sole cause. The fecal occult blood test will detect microscopic amounts of blood in your stool, which could indicate bleeding elsewhere in the digestive tract. The complete blood count will assess your overall health and rule out anemia, which could be a sign of chronic bleeding. It’s unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but we must be thorough. I’ll also want to review your medical history in more detail, if you have it available. Do you recall any previous colonoscopies or other gastrointestinal investigations?
PATIENT: Colonoscopies? Goodness, no. Not at my age! They didn't have those when I was a young man. I used to fly these big aircraft, you know. That’s what I was good at, keeping things running smoothly, not…prodding around in my insides. I’ve had the usual checkups, a bit of blood pressure, a quick listen to the heart, but nothing like… that. I don't believe I've had any trouble with my stomach, ever, apart from the occasional bit of indigestion from a rich meal.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given the lack of previous investigations, we’ll proceed cautiously. I’m going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. It's the most definitive way to determine the cause of the bleeding. They can visualize the entire colon and identify any potential problems. I understand you may be apprehensive, but it's a necessary step. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I will provide you with the referral information, and the gastroenterologist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration to help with bowel movements. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… honestly, Doctor. At my age? It seems a bit extreme, doesn’t it? But… I suppose if you say it's necessary. I don't want to be a bother, you see. I just want this sorted out quickly. High fiber, you say? I do enjoy a good prune or two, now you mention it. Will it…will it hurt? That’s my biggest concern, you understand. I’m not as sprightly as I used to be.
DOCTOR: The colonoscopy itself is performed with sedation, Mr. Rowbottom, so you shouldn’t experience any significant discomfort during the procedure. There may be some mild cramping or bloating afterwards, but that’s usually temporary. The preparation – the bowel cleansing – is often the least pleasant part, but it’s essential for a clear visualization. I will provide you with detailed instructions on the preparation process. It’s important to follow them carefully. I will also write a note to the gastroenterologist outlining your concerns regarding discomfort. They will be able to address those directly. Do you have any other questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. Just… please, make sure they’re gentle, alright? And don't keep me waiting too long for an appointment. I haven’t got forever, you understand. I’ll… I’ll take these instructions. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ve documented everything we discussed today and will send the referral to the gastroenterologist’s office. They will be in touch to schedule an appointment. Remember to follow the preparation instructions carefully. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you again after you’ve had the colonoscopy. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom.
