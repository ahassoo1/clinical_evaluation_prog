DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want much food these days. Not like before, you know? It just… doesn’t feel right. I think that’s why I’m here. It’s been… a little while now. I forget how long, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your stomach feels full or distended, and you've noticed a decrease in your appetite. And this has been going on for a little while. That's helpful to know. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… a tricky one. I think maybe… after the summer heat? It was very warm, you know. Everything feels a little… fuzzy. I used to eat good soups, with lots of vegetables. Now… not so much. I mostly just have tea. It’s hard to remember when it changed. Maybe a month? Or two? It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it started around the time of the warmer weather, perhaps a month or two ago, and you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite since then, with less interest in foods you used to enjoy, like soup. And just to clarify, when you say "big," is that bloating, feeling full quickly, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh… bloating, yes. That’s a good word. Like… after you eat too much, but I haven’t eaten much! It just… feels puffy. And hard sometimes. Not always, just… sometimes. It's uncomfortable, you know? Not painful, just… not right. And it does feel full, even if I don't eat very much. It’s… strange. I used to have a flat tummy. A long time ago! Heh.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bloating and a feeling of fullness even with a small amount of food. And it's not painful, just uncomfortable. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other changes along with this, Soila?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Changes… Oh! I go to the… the place to go, you know? For… business. Yes. And I’ve been going… less often. Because of the… tummy. It’s a little… difficult to get there sometimes. And… oh dear. I forget what I was going to say! It’s very frustrating, this forgetting. Maybe that's a change, I suppose. Not being able to remember things as easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been experiencing some changes in your bowel habits – going to the restroom less frequently – and some difficulty with memory. That’s important information. Now, when you say less frequently, can you give me a general idea of how often you usually go, and how often you’ve been going recently?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a private question, Doctor! Heh. Well… usually, every day. Most days. But lately… every other day, maybe? Sometimes longer. I don’t keep track. It’s not something I… discuss often. It’s just… different. And a little worrying. I used to be so… regular. Everything worked like clockwork! Now… not so much. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to explain it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. You’ve explained it very clearly. It’s helpful to know it’s changed from your usual daily routine to every other day, or sometimes longer. And you're right, these are things people don’t always discuss easily, so I appreciate you sharing this with me. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions? That’s… a long time ago. I used to go to the doctor a lot, when my husband was… well, never mind. I think… I had something with my… heart, maybe? A long time ago. But it was fixed, I think. And… I think I had something with my blood pressure, but I don't remember the details. I'm sorry, it was so long ago. I forget so many things these days. I'm sure it's nothing important now.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like you may have had some issues with your heart and blood pressure in the past, but those were addressed a long time ago. We can look through your records if you'd like to get more details. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. A long time ago, I had… something on my tummy. Near my… belly button, I think. They cut it out. It was small, I think. It didn't hurt too much. And… I think I had something on my leg, too. A long time ago. It was small. I don't remember much about it. Everything feels so… fuzzy. I'm sorry. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had surgeries on your abdomen – near your belly button – and on your leg, both in the past. Knowing you had those is helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. Just my tea! Heh. I drink lots of tea. Sometimes with honey. No… no pills or anything. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. I used to take something for my… heart, maybe? A long time ago, but not anymore. I don't take anything now, except for tea. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Just tea is fine. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a problem with anything, really. I eat most things. I like… fish, sometimes. And soup, when I can eat. No… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I haven’t had any bad reactions, ever. Maybe a little… heartburn sometimes, after I eat too much, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn't typically considered an allergy. Okay, Soila, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My tummy… it doesn’t hurt, usually. Just… uncomfortable. You can listen and feel… whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to feel better, you know? It's just been… tiring, feeling this way. So yes, please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern. I’m also feeling your abdomen. It is a bit tender when I press here and here , and I can feel some fullness. No masses that I can feel at this time. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine sample to get a better understanding of what’s going on. The blood work will check your overall health, including your kidney and liver function, and rule out any infection. The urine sample will help us check for a urinary tract infection. We'll also do a stool test, just to rule out any issues with your digestion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work? And… pee in a cup? Heh. Well… I suppose so. If it helps. And… stool test? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. But if you think it’s necessary, I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong, you know? And feel better again. So yes… blood work, pee in a cup, and… the other thing. Whatever you need. Just tell me what I have to do. It's all a little… scary, though.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel a little scary, Soila. We’ll take everything one step at a time. The blood work just requires a small sample of blood from your arm. We have a comfortable chair for that. The urine sample will be collected in a cup – we’ll give you instructions on how to do that privately. And the stool test will require a small sample of your stool – we'll provide you with a kit and instructions on how to collect it. It’s not as unpleasant as it sounds, and the lab will provide you with everything you need to make it as easy as possible. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid foods that seem to trigger bloating, such as beans or carbonated drinks. And make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… smaller meals, you say? And no fizzy drinks. I used to like fizzy drinks… but maybe I should try that. And plenty of fluids. Yes, I can do that. I like tea, remember? Hmm… questions? Well… will I be sick? I don't want to be sick. And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to wait too long. It’s just… tiring, waiting, you know? And… will it hurt? I'm a little worried about all this poking and prodding. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Soila. Let’s take them one at a time. First, whether you will be sick – it’s unlikely. These tests are primarily to gather information, and they don’t typically cause any discomfort or sickness. As for how long the results will take – the blood work and urine results usually come back within 2-3 business days. The stool test can take a little longer, maybe 5-7 business days. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. And finally, about it being serious – it’s too early to say. That’s why we’re doing these tests – to rule out any serious conditions and get a better understanding of what’s going on. The symptoms you’re experiencing could be caused by many things, ranging from simple digestive issues to something more complex. We’ll know more once we have the test results. I understand you’re feeling anxious, and that’s perfectly normal. We’ll take things slowly and methodically, and I’ll explain everything to you every step of the way. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I just… I don't want to be a bother. I forget things so easily, and I worry I’m not explaining myself properly. And I don't want to be a… a worry to anyone. No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please, call me as soon as you have the results. And… explain everything to me, slowly. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to use too many… fancy words. Heh.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not a bother, Soila. It's my job to listen and help you, and I am happy to do so. And I will absolutely explain everything slowly and in plain language – no fancy words, I promise. I’ll give you the instructions for the tests now, and a number to call if you have any questions. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And remember, please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you become concerned. Thank you for coming in today, Soila. I hope you feel a little more at ease. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I will try not to worry too much.
