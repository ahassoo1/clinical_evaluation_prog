DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Seil, you say? A… unusual name. Not that’s a bad thing. I’m here… well, my daughter, she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card, she said. From you. A “get well” card. I feel fine, you understand. Perfectly fine. But she worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: It’s a common name among my people, Mr. Kammer. And it’s perfectly alright that your daughter wants to ensure you're well. Sometimes a little check-up can ease everyone’s mind, even if you feel completely healthy. So, just to be thorough, let’s talk a little about how you’re feeling. When you say you feel fine, could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Fine means… fine. I go to work, I operate the boilers, I come home. I eat. I sleep. Everything works. No aches, no pains, no… dizziness. I had a little trouble with my knee last year, but that’s gone now. Old age, you know? It fixes itself eventually. I don’t go running marathons, if that’s what you’re thinking. What exactly are you trying to find out, Doctor? This feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you are very capable and maintain a good routine, which is excellent. I’m simply gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It’s not about doubting what you’re telling me, but about ensuring there aren’t any subtle changes we should be aware of. You mentioned some trouble with your knee last year. Was that a specific injury, or more gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual. Just… wear and tear, I suppose. Years of being on my feet, bending and lifting. It got… stiff. Hard to move. I used some liniment, rubbed it in good, and it went away. It hasn’t bothered me in months. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is making a big deal out of nothing. She always has been a worrier. Even as a little girl. A very nice office, by the way. Very… modern.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. We try to keep things comfortable here. It’s good to hear the liniment helped with your knee. Now, aside from that, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy? What do you mean? I get up, I go to work. I don't… collapse in a heap halfway through the day, if that’s what you’re asking. I might be a little tired at the end of the day, but who isn't? I’m 56 years old, Doctor. Things slow down a little. I’m not a young man anymore, you know. I don't need a lecture about getting enough rest.
DOCTOR: No, certainly not a lecture, Mr. Kammer. I’m simply trying to understand your baseline. You mentioned feeling a little tired at the end of the day. Has that been a recent change, or is that typical for you?
PATIENT: Typical. Always been that way. After eight hours on my feet, tending to those boilers, I’m tired. Always. It's… a boiler room, Doctor. It’s hot, it’s loud, it’s hard work. What did you expect? I go home, have dinner, watch a little television, and go to bed. Is this going somewhere? Because frankly, I have things to do. I took time off work for this… card.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. I assure you, this is going somewhere. I want to make sure we address your daughter’s concerns and also ensure your overall well-being. I’m not trying to waste your time. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Do you have any trouble with your breathing, perhaps when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I’m not… short of breath. I climb stairs, I walk around. I don’t… wheeze or cough or anything like that. Look, Doctor, I operate heavy machinery all day. If I had trouble breathing, I wouldn’t be able to do my job. It’s a safety hazard. Is there a point to all this? My daughter just wants a card. A silly card. Can we just get the card and be done with it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask if there’s a point, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if I’m being inefficient. It sounds like you’re very capable and aware of your body, which is excellent. Your daughter is concerned, and sometimes a check-up can just rule things out and give everyone peace of mind. Let's talk about your diet, if you don't mind. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Diet? Well, I eat. What do you want to know? I have breakfast, usually toast and coffee. Lunch is… a sandwich, sometimes soup. Dinner is whatever my daughter makes when she visits. I don’t have any special… requirements. I’m not one of those… fussy eaters. I eat enough to keep me going. It's not like I'm training for a marathon, Doctor. I just need fuel for the boilers.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Weight? No, not really. Maybe a little… around the middle, but that’s just age, you know? Getting older. Things shift. My clothes still fit, mostly. I haven't been on a scale in… a long time, honestly. What difference does it make? Are you trying to find something wrong with me, Doctor? Because I assure you, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, I am not trying to find something wrong with you. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m making you feel uncomfortable. As I said, your daughter is concerned, and I’m simply trying to gather information to address those concerns and ensure your overall well-being. It's a standard part of a check-up, even if you feel perfectly fine. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I don’t believe in… filling my body with all sorts of chemicals. I used liniment for my knee, that’s it. A little rub, that’s all. I had some heartburn a few years ago, but I stopped eating spicy food and that fixed it. Look, Doctor, I think we’re done here. I’ve answered all your questions. Can we just get the card? My daughter is expecting it. I don't want to waste any more of your time, or mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're very proactive about your health and maintain a good lifestyle. Given your statements, and the fact that you're not experiencing any new or concerning symptoms, I can certainly write a note confirming you've had a check-up and are currently in good health. However, given your age, it would be prudent to have some basic bloodwork done to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. It's a simple procedure, and it can help us establish a baseline for future monitoring. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? No. Absolutely not. I’m not sticking needles in my arm for no reason. I feel fine, you keep saying that yourself. I came here for a card, Doctor. A card. Not a medical examination. I’ve wasted enough time already. Just write the note, say I’m healthy, and let me go. I have boilers to operate. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I respect your decision. I will write a note confirming you've had a check-up today and report you are currently feeling well. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider the bloodwork at a later date. It's a valuable preventative measure, and it can provide peace of mind. I will have the nurse prepare the note for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just the note. And please, make sure it says I’m in perfectly good health. My daughter can be… persuasive. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I need to get back to work. And honestly, I think I’m done with doctors for a while.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will make a clear note of your good health. I understand your feelings, and I respect your decision. The nurse will be with you shortly. If you experience any changes in your health, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Thank you for coming in today. And have a safe day back at work. .
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. And thank you… for the note.
