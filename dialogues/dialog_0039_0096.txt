DOCTOR: Hello Arbin, welcome. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too. Well, it's this light sensitivity thing. It's been bothering me for a while now. Anything bright just…really gets to me. Feels like someone's shining a spotlight in my eyes, even when it’s not that strong. It's getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, light sensitivity, or photophobia, you said. And it's been getting worse… Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… It started maybe six, seven months ago? Around February, I guess. It wasn’t too bad at first, just a bit of squinting on sunny days. But now… now it's even inside, with regular lights. Like, the overhead lights in the grocery store… they really bother me. It's kind of hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly, just really uncomfortable and makes me want to close my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began gradually around February, and has slowly worsened to the point where indoor lights are now bothersome. Not painful, but uncomfortable enough to make you want to close your eyes. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I have been getting headaches more often, yeah. Not every day, but maybe two or three times a week. They’re usually in the front of my head, kind of a dull ache. And… oh! My eyes feel gritty sometimes, like there's something in them even when there isn't. Is that connected, do you think? I haven’t really thought about it too much before today.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches – dull ache, frontal – two or three times a week, and a gritty sensation in your eyes. It could be connected, yes. Let’s see… have you noticed any blurry vision, or any double vision at all?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… not really, no. Everything seems pretty clear, I think. And definitely no double vision. I wear glasses sometimes, for reading mostly, but my vision hasn’t changed that I’ve noticed. The light sensitivity is the main thing, and then the headaches, like I said. It just feels… off. Is this something serious, Doctor? I worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, Arbin, and it’s perfectly normal to worry. Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll figure things out. Now, aside from the light sensitivity and headaches, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nausea, no vomiting, and definitely no fever. I've been feeling okay otherwise, just tired sometimes. And, you know, a bit down since… well, since my wife passed. But that’s just life, I guess. The light thing isn’t related to that, is it? It just started a few months after… but I figured it was just a coincidence.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Arbin. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it’s possible stress and emotional strain can contribute to physical symptoms. But let’s explore all possibilities. Do you have any problems with your vision other than needing glasses for reading?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always had pretty good eyesight, to be honest. Just started needing the reading glasses a couple of years ago. I get them checked every year or so, and everything’s been fine. I don’t see any spots or floaters, no pain in my eyes, and I can see colours okay. It's just… this light thing, and the headaches. It’s making it hard to do things, you know? Like, going shopping is a real chore now.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No other vision changes, regular eye exams with no issues. Okay, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I did have a bit of a scare a few years back with my cholesterol, but it came down with diet and exercise. My regular doctor does bloodwork every year, and everything’s been good. I'm on Medicare, so they keep pretty close tabs on things. I don't take any regular medications, aside from a vitamin D supplement in the winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No diagnosed medical conditions, regular checkups, and just a vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My wife was the one with allergies, always sneezing and itchy. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. Is this taking long, Doctor? I don’t want to hold up your other patients.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Arbin, you're not holding anyone up. It’s important to get a good history. No allergies, good. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my wife passed. Didn’t seem right, you know? And I definitely don’t do any drugs. Just a simple life, Doctor. Really. Now, what do you think is going on? Are we talking something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. Thank you for being so open with me. So, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs, no allergies, regular check-ups with good results, and vitamin D supplement. Okay, I think we have enough information for now. I see your last eye exam was in January and was normal. Given your symptoms – light sensitivity, headaches, and a gritty sensation in the eyes – and your medical history, several things could be going on. It could be a simple migraine, tension headache, or even dry eyes. However, it's important to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, check your pupils, eye movements, and a brief neurological exam. That will give me a better idea of what we're dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what's going on and get some relief, if possible. I'm ready whenever you are. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here for me, please. I’m going to dim the lights a bit. First, I’m just going to check your visual acuity. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure. Okay, let me see… um… okay, that’s… E… F… P… Z… V… and… uh… 20/25, I think? Is that right? It's a little blurry, honestly, without my glasses.
DOCTOR: 20/25 is good, but slightly reduced. Okay, now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I just need you to focus on this point here, and tell me when you see something in your side vision.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm focusing on the point. Um… now? I see something… kind of a shadow on the left side… and now on the right… Yes, I can see it pretty well, I think. Is that okay? Do you need me to say something when I first see it?
DOCTOR: Yes, please tell me when you first see something. Good, that’s helpful. Everything seems within normal limits, at least for a quick screening. Now, I’m going to shine a light in your eyes. This will check your pupillary response. Just look straight ahead, please. I’m checking to see how your pupils constrict and dilate. They appear reactive to light, which is good. Now, I'm going to gently check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, please, don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, following your finger. Up and down… left and right… around in a circle… Is that okay? I'm trying my best not to move my head. It's a little tricky, honestly. It makes me a bit dizzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Arbin. You're doing great. A little dizziness is normal with this test. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs, please. This will just check your basic reflexes. Reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. This just involves some simple tasks, like following my finger and smelling different scents.
PATIENT: Okay, smelling scents… following your finger… I'm ready. Um… yeah, I can smell that… lavender, I think? And… yes, I can see your finger clearly. It’s a little bright still, honestly, but I can follow it. What do you think so far, Doctor? Are we getting anywhere? This is all a bit worrying, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You’re able to identify the scent and follow my finger. Based on the physical exam, your cranial nerves are intact, and your reflexes are normal. The light sensitivity is definitely present, and the headaches are concerning, but I don’t see any obvious neurological deficits at this point. Given your age and symptoms, and considering your history, several things could be causing this. It could be tension headaches, migraine without aura, or even something like dry eyes. However, because the light sensitivity is worsening, and you’re experiencing headaches, I want to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a blood test to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying inflammation. And I’d also like to get a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. They can check for any abnormalities in your eyes and rule out conditions like glaucoma or optic neuritis. What do you think about that, Arbin?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood test and an eye specialist… Yes, I’m happy to do that. I just want to know what's going on, and get it sorted out. It's good to be thorough, I think. Will the blood test tell us much? And how long does it take to get an appointment with the eye specialist? I hope it’s not too long. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. The blood test will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out any vitamin deficiencies or underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. It won't pinpoint the exact cause, but it can give us valuable information. As for the ophthalmologist, let me see… I can refer you to Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. The wait time is typically about two weeks, unfortunately. I’ll send the referral electronically to her office and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some artificial tears to help with the gritty sensation in your eyes. And for the headaches, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If those aren't effective, we can discuss other options. Here's a prescription for the artificial tears. I'll also print out a summary of our discussion and the referral information for you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. That’s all very clear. Two weeks for the eye specialist… okay, I can manage that. And the artificial tears… I’ll try those, and the pain relievers if I need them. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I feel a lot better just knowing what’s going on, and that we’re taking steps to figure it out. Thank you, Doctor Kamahele. Seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. We’re here for you. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results of your blood test and the ophthalmologist’s findings. Have a good day, Arbin. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
