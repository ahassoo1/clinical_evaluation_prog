DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Rosanova, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I've been… forgetting things. Not huge things, not yet, but enough that it's starting to worry me. Little things, like where I put my keys, or appointments... stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it now – it’s much better to figure things out early. It's not embarrassing at all; memory issues can happen for lots of reasons. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly… maybe six months ago? It started small, just misplacing things more often than usual. I always thought I was just stressed with work, to be honest. Being a dentist is… demanding. But it’s been getting more frequent, and now I sometimes struggle to remember conversations, or even… names. That’s when I started to get really worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, gradually worsening, and now impacting recall of conversations and names. That’s helpful. And you mentioned stress with work – that’s definitely something we should explore. Just to get a clearer picture, can you give me an example of a recent memory lapse that concerned you?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Just last week, a patient – Mrs. Gable, I think? – came in for a check-up. I’d seen her before, definitely. But when she told me her name, it just… wouldn't come to me. I had to quickly glance at her chart. She didn't seem to notice, thankfully, but I noticed. And it really bothered me. It’s not like I don't know her, it's just… the name slipped away. And then I worried I’d forget something important about her teeth! It’s a bit scary when it’s work-related, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand why that would be concerning, especially with your profession. It's good you're paying attention to these details. Now, let's broaden things a bit. Aside from the forgetting, have you noticed any other changes – maybe with your mood, sleep, energy levels, or ability to concentrate?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I have been feeling more tired lately. Just generally run down. And… I’ve been a bit more irritable, I think. Snapping at my assistant, things like that. I thought it was just stress again, honestly. Sleep… it’s okay. Not fantastic, but I usually get enough. Concentration… I don’t know. Work is still work, but sometimes I feel like I have to really force myself to focus. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t do my job, it just… takes more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, increased irritability, and some difficulty with concentration – requiring more effort to focus. That paints a bit more of a picture. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But as an adult? Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was 16. And… I broke my arm once, skiing. But nothing chronic. I do have high blood pressure, and I take medication for that, but it’s generally well-controlled. Other than that… no. I’m pretty healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a teenager, a broken arm, and high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril, I think. 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else. Oh! And sometimes, if I get a really bad headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Thanks for that detailed information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. No hay fever, no bee stings… nothing. I’m pretty lucky in that regard. Though, my grandmother was allergic to penicillin, if that matters? But that’s her, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and your grandmother had a penicillin allergy, good to note. Now, let’s talk briefly about your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, Alzheimer's, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she always had a terrible memory, even when she was young. Just forgetful, constantly misplacing things. But it was just “Mom being Mom,” you know? We never thought anything of it. My father… he had some heart problems, but nothing neurological. My grandfather, on my mother's side, I think he got a bit confused towards the end of his life, but we didn’t know what it was. They didn't really talk about those things back then. It could have been dementia, maybe? But I honestly don’t know. It wasn’t a clear diagnosis, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of forgetfulness in your mother and possible dementia in your maternal grandfather, but no clear diagnosis in either case. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s quickly touch on your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I cut back a few months ago. Just trying to be healthier, you know? And definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a bit of a health nut, actually, when I’m not forgetting where I put my keys, that is. I try to eat well and get regular exercise, when I can. It’s hard with work, but I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no recreational drugs, and you strive for a healthy lifestyle. Excellent. Alright, Ebony. Based on what you've told me, and looking at your chart, we have a good starting point. You’re a 38-year-old female, generally healthy, with well-controlled hypertension. The recent onset of memory issues, fatigue, and irritability, coupled with a family history of forgetfulness, is something we need to investigate further. I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your reflexes, coordination, and basic cognitive function. It's a pretty standard check. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Rosanova. I just want to figure out what's going on. A physical and neurological exam sounds good. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could sit up straight for me. First, let’s check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Next, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Strength is also good. Finally, I’ll do a quick cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, and I’ll ask you to remember a few words. Just do your best, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm a little nervous, but I'll try my best. Ask away!
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Um… today is… August 2nd. 2025. Is that right? I’m pretty sure. It’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. We’re in… well, I work downtown, so… is that enough? It's a big city. I guess I should say the name? It's… [pause] It's slipping my mind... I know this! It’s… wait. It’s… Oh, bother. I just know it. It starts with a 'C'...
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ebony. It’s okay to pause and think. No pressure at all. Do you want me to give you a hint?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A hint would be great. I feel so silly. I know this city… I live and work here! My brain is just… not cooperating today.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. It happens. Let me just say that we are in a major metropolitan area on the East Coast. Does that help trigger anything?
PATIENT: East Coast… Oh! Is it… New York? No, that’s not right. Boston? Still not… Philadelphia! Is it Philadelphia? Please tell me it's Philadelphia.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ebony, it is Philadelphia! Excellent. You got there. It just took a little prompting. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to try to remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, ready. Bring them on. I hope I can remember this time.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them to me if you can, to help you remember. And then I’ll ask you to recall them later.
PATIENT: Okay… apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Got it. I think. Apple is a fruit. Table is… furniture. And penny is… money. Hopefully, that helps! Apple, table, penny. I’m going to try and repeat it in my head.
DOCTOR: Good. Repeating them is a great strategy. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, just to get a broader picture of your cognitive function. What year is the Declaration of Independence signed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tough one. I… vaguely remember learning it in school. Was it… 1776? I think it was 1776. I'm not very good with dates, I’ve never been. But I'm pretty sure it's 1776. Is that right? I’m second guessing myself now!
DOCTOR: Yes, 1776 is correct. Very good. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not math! That’s… that’s going to be difficult. Okay, here goes… 100, 93… 86… 79… 72… 65… Ugh. I’m already losing track. 58… 51… 44… 37… 30… 23… 16… 9… 2… I think that's it? I'm really struggling. I'm so sorry! This is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ebony. You did very well to get as far as you did. It’s a challenging task. Okay, last question for now. I'm going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Do you remember what they were?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is the part I was worried about. Okay… let me think. Apple… something with furniture… and… a coin? I’m drawing a blank. I remember there being three, but I can't get them to come back to me. Table? Was table one of them? And… penny? Oh, this is terrible! I feel so hopeless. I really thought I had them memorized. Apple, table, penny… I just… can’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ebony. Thank you. That's enough for now. You remembered apple and penny correctly, but struggled with the third word, table. Based on what I've observed during the exam, and combined with your history, you're experiencing some early signs of cognitive decline. Specifically, difficulty with immediate recall and some challenges with concentration and calculation. It’s important to note this doesn’t automatically mean anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. We need to rule out other potential causes, and get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also want to order a brain MRI, to get a better look at the structure of your brain. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I want to figure out what’s happening, and if those tests are necessary, then yes, absolutely. Blood work and an MRI… okay. As long as it gets me closer to an answer, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I’m a little scared, but… better to know, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Better to know. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll write you a requisition for the blood work, and I’ll arrange for a referral to a radiology center for the MRI. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. While we're waiting for the test results, I'd like you to keep a daily journal, noting any episodes of forgetfulness, confusion, or difficulty with concentration. Also, try to engage in mentally stimulating activities, like reading, puzzles, or social interaction. This can help keep your brain active. I also want to discuss some safety precautions. As your memory issues progress, it’s important to avoid situations that could put you at risk, such as driving alone or managing finances without assistance. We can talk about some strategies for managing these risks. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, to discuss the test results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks from today sounds good. Yes, that works. A daily journal, mentally stimulating activities, safety precautions… okay. It sounds like a lot, but I understand. I’ll do my best. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Dr. Rosanova. I’m still scared, but I feel a little better knowing that we have a plan. And I’m thankful you’re taking this seriously. I’m ready to get started, if that makes sense. Let’s figure out what’s going on, and then… well, then we'll deal with it.
DOCTOR: That’s the right attitude, Ebony. And you're not alone in this. I’m here to help you every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the requisitions for the blood work, and I’ll provide you with some written information about cognitive decline and available resources. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. For now, focus on taking care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We'll get through this together.
