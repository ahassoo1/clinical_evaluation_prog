DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And frankly, it's about my eyes. They just aren't what they used to be. I’m starting to have trouble seeing things, you understand? It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, I understand. It's good to have the correct name. Trouble seeing things... can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I've gone blind overnight, if that's what you're thinking. It's gradual. Things are…fuzzy, I suppose. And it’s mostly with reading, really. Newspapers, books…even the television isn't as clear as it once was. I find myself holding things further and further away just to make out the print. It's becoming rather tiresome. I used to be able to read anything, anytime. Now…not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset of blurry vision, primarily with reading. That’s helpful to know. And you’ve noticed you're holding things further away to see them better. About how long has this been going on, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s not been sudden, like I said. Probably… six months, maybe? At first, I just thought it was the lighting. Old eyes, you know? But it’s…persisted. And gotten worse, naturally. I don’t pay much attention to these sorts of things, to be honest. It’s not as if I'm prone to worrying over every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: Six months of gradually worsening blurry vision, primarily with reading. I understand. And you haven’t noticed any other changes in your vision—like flashes of light, floaters, or any pain in your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain? No, certainly not. I’m not one for complaining, Doctor. Flashes… floaters… honestly, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. I just know I can't see as well as I used to. It’s a simple enough problem, isn’t it? Perhaps I just need stronger glasses. Though, I’ve always had excellent eyesight. It’s…disappointing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no flashes or floaters. It sounds like a change in your refractive error is the most likely cause, but we should still perform a thorough exam to be certain. Have you had any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my health? Well… my divorce was finalized last year. A rather stressful affair, if you must know. Beyond that… I suppose not. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good steak now and then. And I try to get some exercise, mostly walking. I wouldn’t say I’m unhealthy. Certainly not. I don’t go to doctors often, if that’s what you’re implying. Never have.
DOCTOR: I see. Stressful life events can sometimes have an impact on overall health, so thank you for sharing that. It's good to hear you generally eat well and exercise. And no, I wasn’t implying anything, just trying to get a complete picture. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Honestly, I avoid them whenever possible. Never been one for popping pills. I can’t say I’ve ever been allergic to anything, though. Perhaps a mild reaction to penicillin as a child, but my mother handled that. I wouldn’t know the details now. It was a long time ago. And I haven't taken anything regularly in decades. Do you really think that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven’t had any significant allergic reactions. Even a mild reaction in the past is helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. As I said, I avoid medications. Vitamins? Supplements? Goodness, no. I get all the nutrients I need from a balanced diet. I believe in taking care of myself naturally, Doctor. Not relying on artificial things. It's a matter of principle, really. I wouldn’t poison my body with those…chemicals.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Diabetes? High blood pressure? Heart disease? Absolutely not. I’ve always been a very healthy man, Doctor. A little thin, perhaps, but certainly not prone to any of those…ailments. My family has good genes, you see. We live long lives. My grandfather lived to be ninety-five. Ninety-five! And he ate steak every day. So, no. I've never been diagnosed with anything like that. Are you sure you need to ask all these questions? It's rather…invasive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel invasive, Mr. Alcorta. I ask them to ensure I have a complete understanding of your health. Alright, so no history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Heavens, no. I’ve never had cause for surgery. I take very good care of myself, as I've said. Hospitalized? Not unless you count a bout of the flu as a child, but that was decades ago. A minor inconvenience, really. I’ve always been able to handle things on my own. I’m a very… resilient man. This is starting to feel like a waste of time, Doctor. I just want to know if I need stronger glasses.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. I want to assure you I'm trying to gather all the necessary information to provide the best possible care. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What precisely are you looking for? My parents lived long lives, as I mentioned. My father died at eighty-two, a perfectly respectable age. My mother made it to eighty-nine. They both… lived quiet, healthy lives. No major illnesses, as far as I know. My siblings are all doing well, though I don’t see them often. We’re… not close. Is this really relevant? I mean, I’m here because I can’t read, not because my grandmother had some obscure ailment.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that information. Knowing your family history of longevity is helpful. Now, just to finish gathering some information, what is your current occupation?
PATIENT: Human Resources. Though, don’t let that fool you. It's mostly paperwork these days. Filing, some basic correspondence. It’s… not a demanding job, shall we say. Though I do have a certain…authority in the department. I've been with the company for twenty years, you see. They value my experience. It's not as if I'm exerting myself physically. Mostly sitting at a desk. Does that answer your question? Honestly, I fail to see the connection between my occupation and my eyesight.
DOCTOR: It's good to know, Mr. Alcorta. It helps me understand your daily activities. Now, before we proceed to the examination, is there anything else you would like to tell me?
PATIENT: No, I believe I’ve covered everything. I’m starting to feel rather impatient, Doctor. I came here for a simple assessment of my vision, not a life history. If you could just take a look and tell me if I need new glasses, I would greatly appreciate it. I have an important meeting this afternoon and I really need to be able to read the reports. I’m starting to think I should have just gone to the optician. They wouldn't waste my time with all these… questions.
DOCTOR: You are right to be frustrated, Mr. Alcorta. I apologize for the lengthy questions. Let's get to the examination, then. We'll check your vision and see what we can determine. I'm going to start with a visual acuity test. Could you please sit in the chair and look at the eye chart on the wall?
PATIENT: Fine. Finally. Let’s get this over with. Just point and tell me when I see something, I presume? I have never had trouble with these charts before. Hopefully this won't take long.
DOCTOR: Yes, just tell me when you can see the letters. We'll start with both eyes open. Okay, can you read the top letter on this line for me?
PATIENT: Is that… an F? Yes, definitely an F. It’s rather blurry, I must say. Though, I can see it. It's just not as crisp as it used to be. You might want to adjust the lighting. It’s rather dim in here, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, the next line. What about this letter?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That one is… difficult. Is that a… P? No… wait. It looks like an R, but very fuzzy. I can barely make it out. Are you sure the chart is in focus? It seems… distorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s try that one again. Just take your time. Can you read this letter?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, this is proving rather difficult. It’s…it’s an L, I believe. But I'm not confident. It’s very faint. And it seems to be shimmering. Honestly, I'm starting to get a headache. Perhaps I should just get the glasses and be done with it. This is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your frustration. It sounds like your vision is significantly reduced, and you're having difficulty with even the larger letters. Based on this initial assessment, it does appear you need a new glasses prescription. However, given the degree of vision loss and your age, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to perform a more thorough examination, including checking your eye pressure and examining the back of your eye. This will help me determine if there are any underlying medical conditions contributing to your vision loss. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Underlying medical conditions? Honestly, Doctor, I told you I’m a perfectly healthy man. I simply need new glasses. But… if it will expedite the process, and if it’s a quick procedure, I suppose I can allow it. But I expect a clear explanation of everything you’re doing, and I want to know what you’re looking for. And don’t keep me waiting. I have a meeting to attend, you know. This is rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I will explain everything as we go, and it won’t take long. The eye pressure test is quick and painless—it feels like a gentle puff of air. And examining the back of your eye will allow me to check for any signs of glaucoma, macular degeneration, or other conditions. It’s just a standard part of a comprehensive eye exam. First, let’s start with the eye pressure test. I’ll need you to look straight ahead while I gently blow a puff of air into each eye. It might make you blink, but it doesn't hurt. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it stings, I'm stopping you immediately. And don’t expect me to be grateful. It’s simply a matter of principle. Get it over with. And be quick about it. I have important things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That was quick. Your eye pressure is reading 14 in the right eye and 15 in the left. Those are within the normal range, so that’s good. Now, I’m going to use a special instrument to look at the back of your eye. It will be close to your eye, but it won’t touch it. I'll need you to focus on a point in the distance while I shine a light. It might be a little bright, but please try to keep your gaze steady. Are you ready?
PATIENT: I suppose so. But if you get too close, I’m warning you now. And don’t shine that light directly into my eyes. It’s…unsettling. Just be quick about it. I don’t like having things near my eyes. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Just relax and focus on that point. … Hmm. I'm seeing some mild drusen in both eyes, particularly in the macula. And there appears to be a slight pallor of the optic nerve. No hemorrhages or exudates. Alright. Those findings suggest some early signs of age-related macular degeneration. The pallor of the optic nerve could indicate some mild glaucoma as well. It's too early to say for certain, but these findings warrant further investigation. I recommend a visual field test and an optical coherence tomography scan. The visual field test will assess your peripheral vision, and the OCT scan will provide a detailed image of the retina, allowing us to get a better understanding of the extent of the macular degeneration. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Macular degeneration? Glaucoma? Doctor, are you serious? I told you I am a perfectly healthy man! This is preposterous. All I need are new glasses! This sounds like a…a sales tactic. You're trying to sell me unnecessary tests. I refuse. Absolutely refuse. I came here for a simple eye exam, not a…a medical diagnosis. I want a prescription for glasses, and I want it now. And I'm leaving. This has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your frustration, but I’m obligated to inform you that ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. While new glasses will certainly help with your vision, they won’t address the underlying causes. I cannot, in good conscience, provide a glasses prescription without further investigation. I strongly advise you to schedule the recommended tests. Here is a referral to a local ophthalmologist who can provide a comprehensive evaluation. Please, consider it carefully. I wish you all the best, Mr. Alcorta. .
