DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with Medicare and we are at the rural clinic today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, Medicare is right. Well… it’s my water, you see. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops, sometimes. It's been happenin' for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Trouble with complete bladder emptying for several weeks, perhaps a month. That can certainly be concerning. Could you describe it a little more for me?
PATIENT: Well, I feel like I gotta go, you know? Normal feelin’. I sit down, start… and it goes for a bit. But then it just… slows way down. Feels like there’s still plenty left, but nothin’ comes out. I gotta… strain, sometimes. And then, after a while, it might start again, but it's never a full emptyin’. It's… frustrating. And a little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Hilber. It is frustrating, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about the stream itself when it is flowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… the stream? Let me think. When it is goin’, it’s… not as strong as it used to be. It's not a trickle, nothin' like that, but it ain't a powerful push, either. More like… a steady flow, but kinda weak. And I sometimes have to… wait a bit to get it started. It don't just come right away, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a weaker stream and some hesitancy starting the flow. Have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating, or any sense of urgency – a sudden, strong need to go – before you actually get to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Dribblin’… not really. Maybe a drop or two sometimes, but nothin’ major. Urgency, though… yes, that happens. Especially when I’m out. I'll be walkin' or somethin', and suddenly I gotta go, right away. It's been happenin' more and more lately. Makes me nervous about goin' places, to be honest. I don't want any accidents.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. That sounds quite bothersome. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And… I had some trouble with my heart a few years back, but they put a little… thing in my leg, and that seemed to fix it. A stent, they called it. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, workin’ hard my whole life. I used to work at the fish plant, fixin' the shoes for the workers. Kept me on my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in your youth and a stent placed for heart trouble. Thank you for letting me know. And you said you’ve generally been a healthy man, which is wonderful. Have you ever had any problems with diabetes or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never been told I have that. My mother had it, but I haven't. Prostate… I don't know much about that. The doctor checked it a few times over the years, I think. Said it was… normal. But I don’t remember much detail. It was a long time ago, and I don't always remember what the doctors tell me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. We can always review things. So, no personal history of diabetes, and prostate checks were normal in the past. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me after my heart trouble. It’s a small white pill. I take it every mornin'. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothin' else. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I ain’t ever had a problem with pollen or animals or nothin'. I'm a pretty simple man, really. Don't have many sensitivities.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to check your prostate with a digital rectal exam. It's important to rule out any physical causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? You mean… checkin’ with my… finger? Oh. Well… I ain’t ever had one of those before. It don’t sound very pleasant. Is it… necessary? I don't like the sound of that at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's not the most comfortable exam, I'll be honest. However, it is a very important part of evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate, which can provide valuable information about what’s causing your difficulty with urination. It's relatively quick, and I will explain everything I'm doing as I go. We can discuss alternatives if you are truly uncomfortable, but it may delay getting to the bottom of this. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if it's important… I guess I can do it. But please, be gentle. And tell me what you're doin’ the whole time. I don't like surprises. What exactly does it involve? You're checkin' the size… of what, exactly? And will it hurt? I’m a little nervous, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I understand your nervousness, and I will absolutely explain everything as I go, and proceed gently. The prostate is a small gland located between the bladder and the rectum. During the exam, I’ll ask you to lie on your side with your knees bent. I will then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of the prostate. It may feel like you have the urge to urinate, but it won't be painful. We’re looking for any enlargement, tenderness, or irregularities. It typically takes less than a minute. I’ll let you know when we’re finished. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… less than a minute, you said. And you’ll tell me what you’re doin’… Okay. I guess… let’s get it over with. But please, be gentle, Doctor. And tell me when you're startin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain each step as I go. I'm going to let you know now, I’m just going to apply a little lubricant… and then I’ll gently insert my finger. It may feel a bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, here we go... “I’m just applying a little lubricant now… and gently inserting my finger. Just relax your muscles as best you can. I’m feeling the size and shape of your prostate now… It feels… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. There is some… mild tenderness on the right side. I'm rotating my finger slightly to get a better feel…” "Alright, we're finished now. How did that feel for you?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t as bad as I thought, but it wasn’t pleasant either. It felt… uncomfortable. That pressure… and that tenderness you felt… that's been botherin’ me for a while. Not all the time, but it’s definitely there sometimes. It felt… sensitive, you know? Like somethin' ain't right. So, what does it mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. The tenderness you felt, along with the slight enlargement, suggests that there may be some inflammation of the prostate, also known as prostatitis. It's not always serious, and there are several possible causes, including infection or non-infectious inflammation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen test, which can help us assess your risk for prostate cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Prostate cancer? Oh dear. That sounds… scary. I don’t want cancer. Is it likely? Is that what you think it is? What happens if it is cancer? I'm gettin' nervous again, Doctor. A urine test and a… what was it, a PSA test? What does that involve? Just more pokin’ and proddin’?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Hilber. It’s natural to be concerned when you hear the word “cancer.” However, it's important to remember that an elevated PSA doesn't automatically mean you have cancer. Many things can raise your PSA level, including inflammation, infection, and even age. The PSA test is a simple blood test. It just involves a small blood sample taken from your arm – no more pokin’ and proddin’ than any other blood test. We’ll run the urine test to rule out infection first. Then, if the PSA is elevated, we can discuss further steps, which may include a more detailed examination or, if necessary, a biopsy. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That sounds better. Infection first… that’s good. And if it's just infection, can it be fixed with… pills? I don’t want any big procedures, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. So, a urine test and a blood test… and then we see what happens? Can I still go fishin’ while we’re waitin’ for the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the plan, Mr. Hilber. Urine test and a blood test for PSA. If it’s an infection, it's usually treated with antibiotics, pills, as you said. We'll know more once we have the results. As for fishing, absolutely! There’s no reason to put your life on hold while we wait. In fact, staying active is a good thing. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples for you now, and we’ll get the urine sample collected as well. It’s just a routine test, nothing to worry about. I'll also give you a prescription for some ibuprofen to help manage any discomfort while we wait for the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Ibuprofen and get the tests done. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. And lettin' me go fishin'. It helps to keep my mind off things. Tell me… how long will it take to get the results back? A few days? A week? I don't like bein’ in the dark, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I understand your desire to know as soon as possible. The lab usually takes about 3 to 5 business days to get the results back. Once I have them, my nurse will call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If we don’t hear from the lab within 5 days, please give us a call. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you again for takin’ the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I'll try to stay positive while we're waitin’ for the results. And I'll go fishin’. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. That’s excellent. Staying positive and enjoying your time fishing is a great idea. If anything changes or you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and good luck fishing!
