DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tarin. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become frequent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s primarily in my left leg, though sometimes it feels…distant in my right one, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. And you said it’s primarily in the left leg, with some sensation in the right as well. Could you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. More like…a pins-and-needles sensation, combined with a sort of dull ache. Sometimes it feels cold, even when the room is warm. It’s not constant; it comes and goes, and the intensity varies quite a bit. It’s most noticeable after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been sitting in one position for too long working.
DOCTOR: Alright, pins-and-needles, a dull ache, and sometimes coldness – fluctuating in intensity and related to positioning. That gives me a starting point. When did this start?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Let me think… it began approximately three months ago. I initially dismissed it as simply fatigue from a particularly demanding project I was working on, animating a short film. However, it hasn’t subsided, and, if anything, it seems to be… more persistent now. I’d say it became truly concerning about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around three months ago, initially thought it was related to your work, and more concerning in the last month. Now, does anything specific seem to trigger the numbness, besides standing or sitting for extended periods?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Thinking about it… I’ve noticed it seems slightly worse after I’ve been doing a lot of fine motor work, like detailed sculpting or very precise animation. Not every time, but frequently. And… this is a little odd, perhaps, but it feels a bit more pronounced on days when the weather is particularly damp or cold. Though, I’m not entirely certain if that’s a correlation or just coincidence.
DOCTOR: Okay, fine motor work and potentially damp/cold weather. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous injuries to your back, hips, or legs?
PATIENT: Certainly. No major injuries, thankfully. I did sprain my ankle—my right ankle—about five years ago playing basketball, but that healed completely after physical therapy. Aside from that, nothing significant that I can recall. No fractures, dislocations, or surgeries in those areas. I generally consider myself quite healthy, and reasonably coordinated, despite spending long hours hunched over a computer.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the ankle sprain. And you haven’t had any other prior injuries or surgeries to your back, hips, or legs. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Nothing diagnosed, at least. I had a fairly persistent case of the flu a couple of years ago, but that resolved on its own. Otherwise, I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing much in the way of medical attention. No chronic conditions, no allergies that I’m aware of, and I don’t currently take any medications. I maintain a fairly healthy diet, and I try to get regular exercise when my workload allows.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no current medications, and generally healthy. Let's briefly touch on family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – with conditions like diabetes, neuropathy, or back problems?
PATIENT: That's a pertinent question. My maternal grandfather—on my mother’s side—did have diabetes, type 2, I believe. He developed it later in life, though. And my uncle—her brother—suffered from chronic back pain for a number of years, stemming from a logging accident when he was younger. Other than that, as far as I know, there aren't any other notable instances of similar conditions within the family. I can inquire further with my mother if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your maternal grandfather and back problems in your uncle. That’s good information. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed at your convenience. I'll do my best to remain still and cooperate as needed. I assume this will involve some range of motion tests and checking my reflexes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. We'll assess your range of motion, reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Please lie down on the examination table. Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. We'll test the patellar reflex first. Good. Now the Achilles reflex. Both reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, let's check your muscle strength. Could you please point your toes, and then pull them back towards your shin?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, here we go. Is that sufficient? I believe I have full range of motion in those movements, although I admit I haven’t purposefully focused on testing that recently. Please let me know if you need me to exert more force or hold the position for a longer duration.
DOCTOR: Good. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, I’m going to assess sensation. Close your eyes for me. Tell me when you feel this. …and now this. …and now the top of your foot. Okay, good sensation in your left foot. Now let's repeat that on your right foot. Alright. Sensation appears intact bilaterally. I'm going to palpate your lower back now. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed. Yes… and… yes, I feel that. And that one as well. Okay. No, that feels… normal. Perhaps a slight discomfort along the lower lumbar region, but nothing particularly acute or painful. It’s the sort of baseline tension I experience after a long day working, if that makes sense. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache, similar to the sensation in my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, some baseline lumbar tension with a dull ache. Based on the exam, I’m not detecting any gross neurological deficits. However, given your description and the intermittent nature of the symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests to rule out some possibilities. A vitamin B12 level, to rule out deficiency, and an MRI of your lumbar spine to assess for any nerve compression. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds entirely reasonable. A vitamin B12 level and an MRI of my lumbar spine seem like prudent steps to take. I am perfectly amenable to those tests. Could you please explain the process for scheduling those, and any preparatory steps I might need to take prior to the MRI?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will write the orders now. The lab will contact you directly to schedule your blood draw for the vitamin B12 level – that should be fairly straightforward. For the MRI, the radiology department will also contact you directly to schedule an appointment. They’ll give you specific instructions, but generally, you’ll need to remove any metal objects and may be asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding any implants or metal in your body. They will also likely advise you on whether fasting is required. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to avoid prolonged standing or sitting in one position if possible. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. Do you have any allergies to those medications?
PATIENT: No, I have no known allergies to ibuprofen or naproxen. I’ve taken both in the past without incident. Avoiding prolonged positioning is somewhat challenging given my profession, but I will certainly make a conscious effort to incorporate more frequent breaks and stretching into my work routine. I appreciate you outlining those recommendations. Is there anything else I should be aware of in the interim, or any specific symptoms that would warrant contacting the clinic sooner rather than later?
DOCTOR: Good. Just try to be mindful of your body. If you experience any new symptoms—weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain—please contact the clinic immediately. Those would be red flags. Otherwise, we'll get the test results back and discuss them at a follow-up appointment, which we’ll schedule once the radiology department confirms an appointment time. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent. I understand the red flags to watch out for, and I’ll be sure to contact the clinic promptly should any of those arise. I appreciate your thoroughness and clear explanations, Dr. Soodeen. I look forward to hearing from the radiology department regarding the MRI appointment. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. I will have the orders sent to the lab and the radiology department electronically. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a good day.
