DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Pirl. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, see? They just won’t stop. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, feels like a week now. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go. Quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week. Started last Tuesday, I believe. Though, to be fair, my days do tend to blur a little these days! But definitely since then. It’s not painful, just… startling, you know? And a bit embarrassing when I'm out and about.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Quite disruptive, indeed. And, if you don’t mind me asking, has anything specific seemed to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I can pinpoint, no. I was gardening last Tuesday, before they started, but I garden all the time! Didn’t have anything unusual to eat, wasn’t particularly stressed… I did have a lovely chat with my grandson on the phone Monday evening, but that was a good thing! I really can’t put my finger on it. It just… started. Sometimes they come after I eat, sometimes not. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no clear trigger identified. And they occur sporadically, not consistently linked to meals. Do you recall anything else unusual happening around the time they began?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Now that you mention it, the neighbours had a very loud party Monday night. A proper bash, went on until the wee hours. I didn't sleep terribly well, but I've slept through worse, to be honest. Could that have something to do with it? It just seemed like… noise. A lot of noise.
DOCTOR: A late night with a noisy party… potentially. Now, besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms, Doctor. Just the hiccups! No heartburn, no tummy trouble, no dizziness… nothing like that. I'm still eating normally, drinking plenty of water. Feel… well, I feel my age, of course! But not sick, if you know what I mean. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I did have a bad spell with penicillin when I was a girl, but that was ages and ages ago. They don’t give me that anymore, anyway. Other than that, I'm pretty clear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure tablets, Doctor. A small dose, been on them for years. And sometimes, if my joints are particularly achy, I take a little glucosamine. That's all. Nothing else, I promise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, may I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, in my fifties, but that was all straightforward. And arthritis, of course, like most people my age. Nothing major, just the usual aches and pains. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Oh, and a broken wrist when I was a teenager, being a bit of a tomboy! But generally, I've been quite lucky, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-five, so I suppose I have good genes!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. And, if you're comfortable sharing, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father had heart trouble, eventually needed a pacemaker. And my sister, bless her soul, developed diabetes in her sixties. It runs in the family, I think. As for my mother’s side… well, they all lived to be very old, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses, just general good health and a lot of gardening!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mirriam, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to just listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps take your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Happy to help in any way I can. My heart is getting a bit old, but it’s still ticking! Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a few deep breaths for me… and again… Good. Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, sometimes persistent hiccups can be caused by simple things like irritation to the diaphragm, or even just stress. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and the fact that they’ve been going on for a week, I’d like to rule out a few other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Rule out? That sounds a bit… serious, doesn’t it? What sort of possibilities are you thinking of, Doctor? I do try not to worry, but one always gets a little anxious when they start talking about “ruling things out.”
DOCTOR: It's simply a precaution, Mirriam. Nothing to be alarmed about yet. I'm thinking it could be related to your blood pressure medication, or perhaps a minor electrolyte imbalance. To be certain, I'd like to order a simple blood test and an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm and kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test and an EKG… Alright. Yes, that sounds sensible. If it puts your mind at rest, then certainly. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Will I need to fast for the blood test, Doctor? I had a rather nice breakfast… wouldn’t want to waste it!
DOCTOR: No need to fast for this one, Mirriam. Just a routine check. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and get you set up for the EKG. It’s a very simple test, just some stickers on your chest. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if the hiccups become particularly troublesome, or if you experience any other symptoms, like chest pain or shortness of breath, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. And stickers? That doesn’t sound too bad at all! I’ll keep an eye on things, and I’ll contact you if anything changes. Thank you again. Hopefully, it’s just something simple.
