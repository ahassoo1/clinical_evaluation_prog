DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor… Soodeen, was it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. They bother me. A lot. It keeps… happening. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Just… recently. It's unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. “Waterworks” – could you describe what's happening specifically?
PATIENT: Oh… specific… hmm. It feels like I need to… go. All the time. Even when I don’t need to, you see? And it burns. A stinging burn. And sometimes… sometimes it's a bit… difficult. To… start. Does that make sense? I just… it’s a nuisance, mostly. A very bothersome nuisance. I keep having to… rush.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Wease. So, frequent urination, a burning sensation, and occasionally difficulty starting… Is there any pain when you urinate, besides the burning?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, Doctor. More like… discomfort. A heavy discomfort. Low down, you see? It's not… sharp. Just… a dull ache, sometimes. After I… finish. Does that… is that what you mean by pain? I'm not good with these things, you know. Everything feels a bit… mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. Discomfort is a very good way to describe it. And yes, that’s exactly the type of pain I was asking about. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. Not that I recall. I… I try not to look, you see? It’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I just… quickly finish and then… well, you know. I haven't noticed anything… red. Not recently, anyway. It could have been… a long time ago, maybe? My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. No recent visible blood in your urine. And you said this has been happening recently, but your memory is a little unclear on exactly when it started?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. “Recently”. A few weeks, perhaps? Or maybe a month? It all blurs together, you see. Everything does. I just… I know it’s been happening more and more often. And it’s… tiring. Very tiring. Having to go all the time. It interrupts… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very disruptive, Ms. Wease. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical… history. Hmm. That was a long time ago, you see. I… I had a bad divorce, many years ago. Does that count? Other than that… I don’t recall anything. I had the usual… colds, and the flu, I suppose. Nothing… serious. The doctor… the old doctor… he didn’t say anything about anything… lasting. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. So, no known medical conditions that you’re aware of. And you haven’t been seeing a doctor regularly. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. A… a problem with my stomach. Appendicitis, I think it was. And… and something with my… gallbladder. That was… very unpleasant. But that was… decades ago. Everything feels like decades ago, you see? I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. Appendectomy and gallbladder surgery in the past. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? Oh dear. That’s… complicated. My mother… she had… aches and pains. A lot of aches and pains. And my sister… she had problems with her… joints. Rheumatism, I think it was. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t know… she didn’t tell me much. We weren’t… close. It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of aches and pains, possible rheumatism. Now, just a few more questions, Ms. Wease. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I recall. I eat… most things. I used to enjoy shellfish, but… I haven’t had that in years. It was… expensive. And… I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. Nothing… serious, anyway. A bit of a rash sometimes, from… plants, perhaps? But that’s… hardly an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. No, I don't take anything. Never have. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. A bit of chamomile tea, sometimes. Helps me… relax. But that’s… hardly a medication, is it? I don’t like… pills. They make me… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. No current medications. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your abdomen and take your blood pressure. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Hmm. I suppose so. If it must be done. But… please be gentle. I’m… a bit fragile, you see? And… quickly, if possible. I have… things to do. And… I don’t like being poked and prodded. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. Please lie down on the examination table when you’re ready. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. There’s a little tenderness when I press here, on your lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. I’ll need to repeat that measurement in a few minutes. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a urine sample. It will help us check for infection or other abnormalities. We can also do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? Hmm. A urine sample… I suppose that’s… unavoidable. And… blood tests? Oh, I really don't like needles. Not at all. But… if you think it’s necessary. Just… please be quick about it. And… don’t poke too deep. I’m… easily bruised. And… is this going to take long? I really must… get home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wease. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle and efficient with the blood draw. We'll take just a small sample. And yes, we'll try to be as quick as possible. Let's start with the urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll show you the instructions. I’ll also have the nurse come in to draw the blood after you’ve had a chance to provide the sample. While we are waiting for those results, I'm going to start thinking about possible causes for your symptoms. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary exam, it could be a urinary tract infection, though we need the urine test to confirm. It could also be related to bladder irritation, or even something else entirely. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A urinary tract… what did you call it? It sounds… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. And… bladder irritation? What does that even mean? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just… tired of all this. It’s all so… confusing. Just… tell me if it's serious. Please. If it’s something… bad. That’s all I want to know. I don't want a lot of… explanations. Just… the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. You want to know if this is something serious. I will be upfront with you. Based on your symptoms, it's unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, but it is something we need to investigate and treat. Urinary tract infections, if left untreated, can lead to more serious kidney infections, so it's important to rule that out. Bladder irritation can cause similar symptoms, and while less serious, it can be very uncomfortable. We need the test results to determine the exact cause. In the meantime, to help with your discomfort, I recommend drinking plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary drinks, as these can irritate your bladder. We’ll also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers, if needed, once we know the results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Water… eight glasses. That’s… a lot of water. I suppose I can try. And… no caffeine? Oh dear. I enjoy a little coffee in the mornings. But… alright. If it helps. And… pain relievers? What kind? The ones I used to take… they made me… drowsy. I don’t want to be… asleep all day. I have… things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. We can discuss different options for pain relief. There are several over-the-counter medications available, some of which are less likely to cause drowsiness. Ibuprofen or naproxen can be effective, but they can sometimes cause stomach upset, so you’d want to take them with food. Acetaminophen is another option, but it doesn’t have the same anti-inflammatory properties. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Acetaminophen… that sounds… less unpleasant. Less drowsy, you said? Yes, that’s… preferable. And… a specific treatment plan? You mean… something to actually fix it? I just… want this to be over with. I’m tired of all this… bother. Yes, a specific treatment plan would be… good. Very good. Now… can we hurry, please? The nurse… is she here yet?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease. The nurse is just outside and will be in momentarily. And yes, that’s exactly what we're working towards – a specific treatment plan to get this resolved. Once we have the lab results, we’ll have a much clearer picture and can decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you, or any other questions you have before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s… all. Just… hurry, please. And… be gentle. That’s all I ask. Just… gentle. And quickly. I… I don’t like needles. I think that’s… enough questions for now. Yes. Enough.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I’ll let the nurse know your concerns. We will be as quick and gentle as possible.
