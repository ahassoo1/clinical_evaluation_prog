DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s a bit awkward to talk about, actually. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom a lot more often than usual, recently. It’s been… unsettling, to be honest. I don’t quite know why it’s happening, and it’s a bit disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, right. Okay. "A lot more often"... can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… right. Well, before, I’d say… maybe four or five times a day, normally? Now it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes even more often if I drink a lot of water, which is… difficult, since I should be drinking water. It's just… constant, really. I don’t really keep track, I suppose. It just feels like all the time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Feels like all the time"... vague. And is it…daytime only?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that's the strange part. It’s not just during the day. It’s… at night too. It’s woken me up a few times, actually. Which is… not ideal. I’m usually a very sound sleeper. I don't know if that makes a difference. I really wish I could pinpoint when it started, but it’s all a bit… blurry, to be honest. I apologize for not being very precise.
DOCTOR: Nighttime… right. Any pain or burning?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully no pain. And no burning either. Just… the frequency, really. It’s more… inconvenient than anything, and a bit worrying, because… well, I don't know what it means. It doesn't hurt, though. Just… a constant urge. Is that… normal? I truly don't know what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: "Normal"... everyone's worried about what's normal. Any change in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh… well, let me think. Not drastically, no. I've been trying to eat healthier, perhaps? More fruits and vegetables… less processed food, if that counts. But nothing major. And I started drinking more water, as I mentioned, which… perhaps that's contributing? I'm really not sure. I wish I had a better answer for you. I don't usually pay very close attention to those sorts of things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: More fruits… water… Okay. And do you have any… family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother… she had some health problems, but I honestly don't recall specifically what. It was… a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in her care, I’m ashamed to say. I believe she had some issues with… her kidneys, perhaps? But I’m really not certain. I don’t have much information, I apologize. I don't recall anything being… inherited, though. Is that useful? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your… life recently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Yes, actually. I… got divorced about six months ago. It was… a difficult time. And I’ve been… adjusting. Still am, I suppose. It's been a bit… stressful, to be honest. I've been trying to focus on… rebuilding, but it’s… a process. Could that be… related? I hadn't even considered that. I just thought… it was the water. Or the fruits. It's so confusing.
DOCTOR: Stress... yes, that can cause all sorts of things. Okay. Let me just listen to your abdomen. Just lie back on the table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Or just… relax? I apologize, I’m not very good at this part.
DOCTOR: Relax. Nothing remarkable. Soft, non-tender. No masses. Look, it could be a number of things. Stress, as we said. Increased fluid intake. Possibly a mild urinary tract irritation. I'll order a simple urine test, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urine test… yes, that sounds sensible. Will it be… unpleasant? I’ve never really had many tests done, I confess. And… how long will it take to get the results? I do apologize for all the questions. I just… want to understand what’s happening. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I really do.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple sample. They'll give you a cup. Results should be back in a couple of days. If it’s nothing serious, which I suspect it isn’t, we can discuss stress management techniques. Here. Take this to the lab. They're down the hall. And try to cut back on the water for a day or two, see if it makes a difference. Next.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you very much. Cut back on the water… yes, I can certainly try that. And stress management… I suppose that's a good idea. Thank you again for your time, Dr. Ruocco. I appreciate your help. .
