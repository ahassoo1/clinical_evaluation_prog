DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, hello Doctor... Pfennig, is it? Right. Well, my ear, it feels… full. Like something’s blocking it. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Honestly, I can’t quite put my finger on when it started, exactly. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, “full” is a good way to describe it. And you said it’s been going on for a while – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. It feels like… weeks? Maybe a month or two? It’s difficult. Things… blur, you know? I just noticed it one day and thought, “Oh, that’s new.” Then another day passed and it was still there. It hasn't gotten worse, thankfully. Just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or two of persistent fullness. And no worsening symptoms, that’s good to know. Do you have any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not like a sharp pain, no. It's… uncomfortable, I suppose. A bit of pressure sometimes. Like when you’re on a plane, you know? That stuffed feeling. But it’s not painful. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. Just… annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Annoying is a perfectly valid symptom, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear – what we call tinnitus – or any dizziness along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Ringing… dizziness… Now that you mention it… perhaps a little dizziness? Not falling-over dizziness, just… off balance sometimes. Like when I stand up too quickly. And… yes, maybe a faint ringing. It’s not constant, though. Very quiet. I wouldn’t have even noticed it if you hadn't asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing and occasional dizziness when standing up. Have you had any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Changes in hearing… That’s… a tricky one. My wife, God rest her soul, she always said I didn’t listen very well. But I don’t know if it’s worse than before. It just… is. Sounds seem a bit muffled, maybe? But I mostly work outside, with tractors and things, so there's always noise. Hard to tell, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly some muffled hearing, but difficult to say definitively due to your work environment. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your sinuses?
PATIENT: Ear infections… sinuses… Oh dear. My medical history… It’s… patchy. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but I don’t remember details very well. I think… as a child, maybe? Ear infections? It was a long time ago. And I’ve had a few colds, definitely. Sinus issues, yes, sometimes. But nothing major. I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright, patchy is okay. We can work with that. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think... No, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had my appendix out when I was young, I think. But that was… a very long time ago. No major hospital stays or anything like that, no. Mostly just… the usual colds and flus.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, and generally healthy otherwise. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing for any specific condition. I try to stay healthy, you know? Fresh air, good food… that sort of thing. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I'm aware of. I eat everything my wife used to make, and she made everything. No hives, no breathing problems… nothing like that. I might get a little sniffly during pollen season, but that's just… spring, you know? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's do a quick examination. I'm going to look in your ears with an otoscope, and then listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… please be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, I'm looking at your left ear now... There's a little bit of cerumen – earwax – but nothing significant. The ear canal looks clear. Right ear looks similar - a little wax, but no obvious inflammation or blockage. Heart sounds are regular and within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, everything sounds and looks relatively normal so far. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might have some mild fluid build-up in your middle ear, possibly from a mild viral infection or Eustachian tube dysfunction. However, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a tympanometry test, which measures the movement of your eardrum, and an audiometry test to check your hearing levels. Would you be willing to do those today?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping we could get this sorted out quickly. I understand you need to be thorough, but I have a farm to run, you know? Alright, alright. If it will definitely help figure out what’s wrong, I suppose I can spare the time. But please, make it as quick as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and efficient as possible. These tests will give us a much clearer understanding of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. It'll take about 20-30 minutes total. We'll start with the tympanometry – it just involves placing a small probe in your ear – and then we'll move onto the audiometry, which involves wearing headphones and responding to different tones. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Headphones… tones… Alright. Twenty to thirty minutes… very well. Let’s just get it over with, then. The sooner we know what’s wrong, the sooner I can get back to work. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step into this booth, and I’ll explain the procedure to you once we’re inside. It’s a quiet room, so we can get an accurate reading. I’ll be just outside if you have any questions.
PATIENT: A booth, you say? Alright. Just… please don't take too long.
