DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather… unpleasant. I have something going on in my mouth. It’s quite bothersome, really. I don’t usually bother with these things, but my wife insisted. She says it looks… bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in, and it's always wise to listen to your wife. “Something going on in your mouth” is a little vague, though. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… white. Patches. Inside my mouth. On my tongue, mostly. And it hurts a bit when I eat anything sweet. Honestly, it’s quite undignified. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain a very strict oral hygiene routine. This is… unexpected.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Schieber. It’s good to know you take good care of your oral health. White patches inside the mouth, particularly on the tongue, and pain with sweets… that gives us a few possibilities to consider. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me how long you’ve noticed these patches?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Not long, truthfully. Perhaps a week? Maybe a little less. It came on rather suddenly, which is what’s so concerning. I don't recall doing anything different. I haven’t been ill, haven't changed my toothpaste… it’s a mystery, really. And a rather inconvenient one.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week. And no recent illnesses or changes to your routine. That’s helpful. Has anything made it worse, besides sweets?
PATIENT: No, not really. Perhaps… hot beverages aggravate it slightly. But I drink coffee. A good, strong coffee. I’m not about to give that up for a bit of… discomfort. It's not debilitating, Doctor. I’m a busy man. I simply want to know what it is and, ideally, a quick solution.
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… no, not really. Perhaps a little… fatigue, now that you mention it. But I work long hours. That’s to be expected, isn’t it? And… my wife says my breath isn't as fresh. But she always notices these things. Honestly, I think she enjoys finding fault. No, no other symptoms of any consequence, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and your wife mentioning your breath. We'll keep those in mind. Now, Mr. Schieber, I'd like to take a quick look inside your mouth. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Must you? I assure you, it’s not a pretty sight. But… very well. If you insist. Just… be quick about it, please. I have appointments. And I prefer not to dwell on these… unpleasantries.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please open wide and say “Ah.” Okay. I see what you mean. There are some white patches – what we call leukoplakia – on your tongue and inner cheeks. There's a little bit of redness too. Have you used any tobacco products in the past?
PATIENT: Tobacco? Absolutely not! I find the habit… barbaric. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, Doctor. I assure you, that is not the cause. My father smoked, and I made a conscious decision very early on to avoid such… vulgarity. No, that is quite out of the question. It must be something else. Perhaps a vitamin deficiency?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schieber. Thank you for clarifying. It’s good to rule things out. A vitamin deficiency is certainly a possibility, as is a fungal infection, or even irritation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Goodness. This is rather tedious, isn’t it? Well… I had my appendix removed when I was a boy. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. Other than that… nothing significant. I’ve always been a very healthy man. A bit of the flu now and then, naturally, but nothing that required… extensive medical attention. I take pride in my constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… well, he enjoyed his cigars, as I mentioned. He died of… complications, I think. It was quite a long time ago. Nothing particularly… relevant, Doctor. We weren’t a particularly sickly family. Mostly… hardworking people.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I believe in maintaining a natural state of health. I don't pollute my body with unnecessary chemicals. I might take an occasional aspirin for a headache, but that's it. No supplements, no vitamins, nothing of the sort. I get everything I need from a balanced diet. A good steak, a glass of red wine… that’s my medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve always been quite robust, Doctor. I don’t succumb to such… weaknesses. No allergies to food, no allergies to medications… nothing. I’m perfectly… resilient. Really, I can't imagine what’s causing this. It's quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it’s most likely a case of oral leukoplakia. It's often caused by irritation, and in your case, could be related to the shape of your teeth, or even your diet. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to take a small scraping of one of the patches to send to a lab for analysis – a biopsy. It’s a quick and painless procedure, and it will give us a definitive answer. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scraping? A biopsy? Doctor, really! Must we resort to such… invasive measures? I thought you said it was likely just irritation! This sounds rather… serious. And time-consuming. I have a very busy schedule, you know. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… try something else? Perhaps a mouthwash? Or a change in diet? I’d rather avoid any… procedures if possible. It all sounds rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Schieber. You’re right to ask. While it's likely irritation, it’s crucial to rule out other possibilities, including precancerous changes. The biopsy is a small precaution, and early detection is always best. It's a very quick procedure – it takes only a few minutes, and we can do it right here in the office. It's a tiny sample, and it doesn't usually cause any discomfort. It will give us a definitive answer, and allow us to create the most appropriate treatment plan. If it is just irritation, then we can simply focus on managing that with changes to diet or oral hygiene. If you'd prefer, we could try a strong anti-fungal mouthwash for two weeks and see if that improves things. However, if the leukoplakia persists, or worsens, we’d still need to do the biopsy. It’s better to be certain. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Two weeks of mouthwash… Hmm. Very well. I suppose that's… acceptable. But if it doesn't work, I expect a prompt appointment. And I trust it won’t stain my teeth. I have a very important meeting next month. And please, Doctor, be quick about it. I really haven’t the time for lengthy procedures. It's a waste of my valuable time, quite frankly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I understand your concerns. We'll prescribe a strong anti-fungal mouthwash – Nystatin – to use twice a day for two weeks. It's unlikely to stain your teeth, but if you notice any discoloration, please let us know immediately. I’ll also give you a prescription for a fluoride rinse to help strengthen your teeth. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to reassess the situation. If the leukoplakia doesn't improve, or if it worsens, we'll proceed with the biopsy. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding hot or spicy foods and drinks, and maintaining excellent oral hygiene – gentle brushing and flossing. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… please ensure the prescription is accurate. I don’t want any complications. And the appointment should be at a convenient time. I have a very full schedule, you know. Thank you. And now, if you’ll excuse me… I have matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I’ve made a note of your schedule preferences. I’ll have the nurse send the prescriptions to your pharmacy, and she’ll confirm the follow-up appointment time. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
