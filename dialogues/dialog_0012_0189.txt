DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, I suppose. Though I usually don't bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. It's just... well, I saw something in the toilet this morning that wasn't quite right. Blood. In my stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be alarming. And you're a young one, aren't ya? Not much experience, I'd wager.
DOCTOR: Thanks for coming in despite that, Arbie. It’s always good to get things checked out, and you’re right to want to investigate. And you’re right again, I’ve been practicing for 13 years now, but I always approach each patient with a fresh perspective. It’s important. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to talk about. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Thirteen years. Still just a pup, really. Alright, alright. It was... bright red, mostly. Not dark, like... well, I wouldn't know what dark blood looks like, truthfully. Just... noticeable. And it wasn't a huge amount. A streak, more like. And it only happened once, this morning. I haven’t changed my diet or anything, either. Eat the same things I always have. Mostly fish, when I can get it. And toast. Plain toast. Don't need any fancy things.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood, a streak, and just this morning. And no changes to your diet – mostly fish and toast, that’s good to know. Have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, or with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… rumblin’ sometimes, you know? Old age, probably. But nothing sharp. Nothing that sent me running for anything. Bowel movements… regular as clockwork, usually. Though maybe a bit… harder than they used to be, now that you mention it. But that’s just getting older, isn't it? Everything slows down eventually. Don't see what the fuss is about a little blood. People get cuts all the time. It's probably just a little scratch, somewhere along the way.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're having regular bowel movements, even if they're a bit harder than usual. And you're right, changes with age are common. However, any bleeding from the rectum needs to be investigated, even if it seems minor. It's good that you noticed it. Let's talk a little more about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms lately – like fatigue, weight loss, or feeling weak?
PATIENT: Weak? Always a bit weak, honestly. Old bones, you know. I get tired easily, but that's just life. Weight loss… haven't been weighing myself. Don't see the point. I eat when I'm hungry. And I haven't noticed… dramatically shrinking, if that's what you're asking. Just… old. Everything's just… slower. I used to be able to haul a salmon upriver without breaking a sweat. Now… well, now I take it easy. Is this going somewhere? You're asking a lot of questions for a little blood.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve noticed some natural changes with age, which is perfectly normal. I'm asking these questions to get a full picture of your health and rule out anything more serious. Sometimes, even small changes can be important. Now, have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for colon cancer?
PATIENT: A colon-what-now? Sounds… unpleasant. No. Never had one of those. Never needed one, as far as I know. My father didn’t have one. My grandfather didn’t have one. We were fishermen, not… whatever people do with those things. Just didn’t come up. Never felt the need to poke around in there. And frankly, don’t want to start now. Is that necessary? Is this about the blood? Because if it's just a little scratch, I’m not sure why all this fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arbie. A colonoscopy is a screening test to look for any abnormalities in the colon and rectum, like polyps that could potentially become cancerous. It’s a routine part of healthcare, especially as we get older, even if you haven’t had any issues before. Given your age and the bleeding you experienced this morning, I do recommend we consider it. It's the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding and ensure there's nothing serious going on. It's not necessarily about assuming something is wrong, but about being proactive and making sure everything is healthy. Before we talk about scheduling that, though, let's quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. I’ve taken a few things over the years… pain pills when I broke my wrist falling off a boat, some cough syrup when I had a bad cold. Nothing ever… reacted badly, as far as I can remember. Though, like I said, my memory isn't what it used to be. Mostly just fish oil these days. For the joints, you know. Everything’s creaky. And I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I quit… oh, goodness, forty years ago, maybe more. Not much use for it anymore. Now, this colon-whatsit… is it painful? Because if it’s going to be terribly unpleasant, I’m not sure I’m willing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you haven’t had any allergic reactions to medications. And quitting smoking forty years ago is fantastic! That’s a huge accomplishment. As for the colonoscopy, we do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. You'll be given medication to make you relaxed and drowsy, and you won't feel any pain during the procedure. Most people don’t remember much of it at all. The preparation beforehand – cleaning out your colon – is the least enjoyable part, but it’s necessary for a clear view. Before we go into the details of that, let’s just quickly cover your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have had colon cancer or any other gastrointestinal problems?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family history. Now you're getting to things I really don't remember. My mother… died young, influenza, I think. Didn’t talk much about ailments, back then. My father… a fisherman, like I said. Tough old bird. Worked right up until the day he… well, until he didn't anymore. Never complained much, either. And I had a brother, but he… disappeared at sea when we were young. Never knew much about his health. No one talked about these things. It was just… life. Tough and hard and you carried on. So, no. I don't have any family history of… whatever you're asking about. Is this all necessary for a little bit of blood? I’m starting to feel like a specimen.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Arbie, and I apologize for asking so many questions. It feels intrusive, I know. But knowing your family history helps me assess your risk and make the best recommendations for your care. Given your age, the bleeding, and the lack of family history information, I still recommend we pursue further investigation. While it could be something minor, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Before we discuss scheduling a colonoscopy, let’s talk about some alternative options. There's a stool test we can do, called a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test. It detects blood in your stool. It's not as accurate as a colonoscopy, but it's a less invasive way to screen for colon cancer. If it comes back positive, we would still need to do a colonoscopy to investigate further. Would you be open to starting with the FIT test?
PATIENT: A… fit test? Sounds less awful than poking around in there. Is it painful? Does it involve… anything unpleasant? Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit worn out just thinking about all this. And frankly, I don’t want to spend my remaining years running to doctors over a little bit of blood. If it’s just a little scratch, I’d just as soon leave it be. But… a fit test. Alright. As long as it doesn’t involve any… major procedures. Is it expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. These things add up.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Arbie. And you're right to be concerned about cost and inconvenience. The FIT test is a very simple test. It involves collecting a small stool sample at home, using a kit we can provide. There's no pain involved, and it doesn't require any special preparation. The cost is relatively low – around $25, which we can potentially cover through a financial assistance program. We'll discuss that if you decide to proceed. If the test comes back negative, we can likely rule out any serious concerns and you can go back to enjoying your life. If it's positive, we'll discuss the next steps, which would likely involve a colonoscopy. But we'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Does the FIT test sound like something you'd be comfortable trying?
PATIENT: $25? That’s… manageable. And no poking around? Alright. As long as it's just a little sample, and no expensive procedures unless absolutely necessary. And you promise to take it easy on me if it's positive? I'm an old man, Dr. Yoshino. I've lived a long life, and I don't want to spend my remaining days worrying about… things. Alright. Let’s do the fit test. Give me the kit, and let's get this over with. Just… please don't make me come back if it's nothing. I have better things to do. Like fish. If I can still manage it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. I promise to take it easy on you. We’ll take things one step at a time, and only do what’s necessary. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make this as smooth and stress-free as possible. Here’s the kit. It comes with instructions, and we have a nurse who can go over them with you as well. It just involves collecting a small sample and mailing it back to the lab. We'll get the results in about a week. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the instructions. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… alright. Just get me through this, Dr. Yoshino. And thank you. For not making me feel like a complete… specimen. And for not pushing me into anything I’m not comfortable with. That's all I ask. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to get home and… rest. All this talking is exhausting. .
