DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it hurts. Lower back, mostly. Been hurting for a while now, and it’s getting… not better, you know? It’s just a dull ache, but it’s always there.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent lower back ache can be quite bothersome. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Hmm… well, it’s worse when I stand for too long. Or if I try to lift something, even something not that heavy. Sitting isn’t so bad, usually. But getting up from sitting… oof. That’s a killer. It’s been like this for… oh, maybe six months, I think? Hard to say exactly. I just figured it was my age, you know? Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: I see. Six months of persistent pain is definitely something we should investigate. And you're right to seek it checked out, regardless of age. It’s good you’ve noticed it's worse with standing and lifting, and when getting up from a seated position. That gives us some clues. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you describe the pain itself a little more?
PATIENT: Clues, you say? That’s good. I like that. The pain… it’s not sharp. Not like a sudden thing. It’s more… a heavy ache. A dull, constant pressure. Sometimes it feels like it’s right in the bone, if that makes sense. And sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not all the way to my foot. Just… the upper part of my leg. Not every time, though. And it’s worse in the mornings, usually. I feel… stiff, you know? Like an old tree.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. A heavy ache, radiating to the upper leg, worse in the mornings with stiffness… those are all important details. It sounds like it could be related to several things. To get a more complete picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever had any back problems before – injuries, surgeries, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries, definitely. Never needed those, thank goodness. Injuries… well, when I was younger, working in the fields back in Lebanon, I pulled my back a few times. Nothing serious, just… strains. I’d lie down for a day or two and be okay. Nothing like this, though. This is… different. And I think I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that was a long, long time ago. Doesn’t seem relevant, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that's all helpful information, even the broken arm. It helps me understand your overall health picture. So, some past back strains, but nothing that lingered like this current pain. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, the doctor told me. But I took pills for it, and it went down. Haven’t needed pills for it in… oh, maybe ten years? And my wife… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. But I never had that. Just the blood pressure, for a time. And I don’t take any other medicine now, just… a little something for my sleep sometimes, if I can't get to rest. But that's not regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that’s now controlled, and your wife had arthritis. You occasionally use something to help with sleep. That's good to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. I can eat anything, take anything, no problem. My wife, she was allergic to… dust, I think? Sneezed all the time, poor thing. But me? Nothing. Clean as a whistle, I always say. Though I don’t drink much alcohol, if that counts for anything. A little wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. No allergies, occasional wine – good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had any back problems, arthritis, or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… let me think. My mother, she had… aches and pains all over, when she got older. Not just her back, everything. But she didn't go to the doctor much. Old-fashioned woman, she was. My father, he was strong as an ox. Never sick a day in his life. My sister, she had… diabetes, I think? Yes, diabetes. And her husband… he had problems with his heart. But no one, that I know of, had bad back problems, like me. Just the general aches and pains of getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of general aches and pains, diabetes in your sister, and heart problems in her husband. No specific back issues that you're aware of. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was a young man, back in Lebanon, but I didn’t like it. Made me sick. I always said it was a foolish habit. And my wife, she didn’t smoke either. We both believed in fresh air and good food. That’s what keeps you healthy, you know? Not those things.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Avoiding tobacco is very good for your overall health. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your current activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay active. I walk to the store most days, if the weather is nice. And I like to garden. That keeps me busy. But I can’t do as much as I used to. This back… it makes it hard. I used to be able to lift heavy bags of soil, no problem. Now… I have to ask the store owner to help me bring them to the car. And I sit a lot, too. Watching television, reading… old man stuff, you know? It's not much, but I try.
DOCTOR: I understand. Staying active is good, even with limitations. Gardening and walking are excellent. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, that gives me a good understanding of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to assess your back and see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I want to figure out what’s wrong with my back. It’s just… frustrating, you know? Can’t do the things I used to. So, yes. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. I will be as gentle as possible. I'm going to have you lie on your back on the examination table. We'll start with a visual inspection, then I'll gently feel along your spine to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll also ask you to move your legs and back in a few different directions to see how that feels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Just… let me know if you see anything bad, okay? I worry sometimes. I’m getting old, and things break easily, you know? Alright, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I’m going to start by just looking at your back. I'm not touching anything yet. I'm looking for any obvious signs of asymmetry, swelling, or skin changes. I don't see any significant swelling or skin changes. Your spinal curvature appears normal. Now, I’m going to gently feel along your spine. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness right here, in the lower lumbar region. And there’s a bit of muscle spasm on both sides. It’s not severe, but it’s present. Does that match what you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly where it hurts. Right there, in the lower back. And the muscle… yes, it feels tight. Like a knot. That’s what it feels like. It’s been like that for weeks now. Not too hard, please. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vankampen. I apologize if that caused any discomfort. I’ll be very gentle. Now, I’m going to ask you to move your legs and back in a few different directions. This will help me assess your range of motion and identify any areas of pain. First, could you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s… difficult. Can’t quite reach. And it hurts, Doctor. Right in the lower back. Not sharp, just… a heavy ache. Not as easy as it used to be, you know? Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vankampen. It's alright to stop when you feel discomfort. You didn't reach your toes, and I noticed some limitation in your forward bending. Now, could you lie on your back and lift your right leg straight up in the air, keeping your knee straight?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s hard too, Doctor. Can’t get it very high. And it hurts a little in my hip. Not bad, just… a twinge. Feels stiff, you know? Like an old tree. Not much bend in these old bones.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited range of motion and some discomfort in your hip. Now, let’s try the other leg. Could you lift your left leg straight up in the air, keeping your knee straight?
PATIENT: A little easier than the other one, Doctor. But still… hard. And it’s still a little twinge in my hip. Not a sharp pain, just… a reminder that I'm getting old. Maybe I should have stayed a farmer. Less bending, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, that's enough for now. I’ve assessed your range of motion and palpated your back. Based on what I've found, you have some tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower lumbar region, limited range of motion, and some discomfort in your hips. I don't believe this is an emergency situation, but it is something we need to address. Based on your history and physical exam, it appears you likely have a lumbar strain. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some X-rays of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays, you say? Alright, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s wrong with my back. Can’t keep living with this ache, you know? Alright, X-rays it is. Just… tell me if they see anything bad, okay? Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. We’ll take all necessary precautions during the X-ray. We'll get those scheduled for you right away. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend some conservative treatment options. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm and an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, to help manage the pain. It’s important to take these as directed. I'll also recommend you start some gentle stretching exercises and low-impact activities, like walking, to help improve your range of motion and strengthen your back muscles. I have some handouts here with some examples. And, very important, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions about the medications or the exercises?
PATIENT: Handouts, you say? Yes, that would be good, Doctor. I’m not very good with remembering things these days. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… alright. And gentle stretching. No heavy lifting. I can do that. But… what if it doesn’t get better? What if it’s something bad? And… is ibuprofen okay with my blood pressure? I had trouble with that before, I think.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Vankampen. I understand your concerns. Let’s address them one at a time. First, regarding your worries about it not getting better or being something serious: The X-rays will help us rule out any underlying issues like fractures or significant arthritis. Most lumbar strains improve with conservative treatment within a few weeks. If your pain doesn’t improve after a reasonable period, or if it worsens, we can consider further investigation, such as an MRI or referral to a specialist. Now, regarding ibuprofen and your blood pressure: That’s a very good point to bring up. Ibuprofen can sometimes raise blood pressure. Since you had previous issues with it, I’m going to recommend you use acetaminophen instead. It’s a good alternative for pain relief that doesn’t carry the same risk to your blood pressure. I'll make a note of that in your chart and provide you with information on acetaminophen. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen, you say? Yes, that sounds better. Good thinking, Doctor. I always worry about those side effects. Alright, acetaminophen. No ibuprofen. I can remember that. And if it doesn’t get better… we’ll get more X-rays. Or an MRI. Handouts, you said? Yes, please. I need to write everything down. Old man stuff, you know? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I ask a lot of questions, I know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. Please, ask as many questions as you need. It's my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with your treatment plan. Here are the handouts. The stretching exercises are a good place to start, but listen to your body and don’t push yourself too hard. And the other handout details the dosage and precautions for acetaminophen. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing and review the X-ray results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Gentle stretching. Acetaminophen. Follow-up in two weeks. And call if anything gets worse. I can remember that. Thank you very much for your time and patience. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
