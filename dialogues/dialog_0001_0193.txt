DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein, 39… look, I've got a packed schedule today, so let's just get straight to it. What brings you in here?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I have… a lot of gas. More than usual, I mean. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It is… disruptive, and frankly, uncomfortable. I apologize for bringing this to your attention, but it is causing me some worry.
DOCTOR: Gas?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Flatulence. Excuse me. A lot of… passing gas. It is not painful, exactly, but it is… frequent. And sometimes… quite loud. I am a bit concerned something is… not right, even though I understand it happens to everyone. It just feels different this time.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Goodstein, people come in here with real problems. But alright, alright. A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately one week, Doctor. It began, I believe, after I ate a… a rather large cabbage. But I have eaten cabbage before, and never with this… consequence. I eat a fairly simple diet, mostly. Sandwiches, soups… not much spice. Do you think the cabbage is the cause, even if I have eaten it before without issue?
DOCTOR: Cabbage… right. And what else have you been eating?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, yesterday I had a… a ham and cheese sandwich on rye bread. And a small tomato soup. The day before… a chicken salad sandwich. Mostly things you would find at a… a deli. I do drink a lot of water, if that is relevant. And sometimes, a small soda with lunch. Is the soda a problem? I am not usually one for… sugary drinks.
DOCTOR: So, a fairly standard diet. Water’s good, soda… not so much. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not traveled recently. I live here, in the city, and I have been here for… oh, almost ten years now. I mostly go between my work and my apartment. I work at the… the fast food place, down on Elm Street. It is a… a burger shop. No changes to my routine, aside from this… gas issue. Do you think it could be something I am doing at work? Perhaps the food they serve?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Goodstein, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms, Doctor? Let me think… No pain, as I said. No… stomach cramps. Perhaps a little bit of… bloating, sometimes, after I eat. And a bit of… feeling full, even if I haven't eaten very much. But nothing serious, I assure you. Just… the gas. And the bloating, occasionally. Is bloating a cause for concern with… excessive gas? I apologize for asking so many questions. I do not mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s have you lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just… try to relax. And try not to… well, you know.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will lie down on the examination table. I shall attempt to relax, and… be mindful of my… condition. Please let me know if there is anything specific I should do, or if you require any further information. I am a bit nervous, I must admit. It is not every day one has their abdomen… listened to.
DOCTOR: Okay… sounds… normal. Bloated, yes, but no obvious signs of anything… alarming. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any known allergies to medications. I have taken… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches, but nothing prescription. I have never had a… reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a… strong constitution. Is that… a good thing, in this situation?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a basic blood panel. Rule out anything… obvious. And I suggest you try an over-the-counter gas remedy. Simethicone, something like that. And maybe cut back on the soda. Next.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A blood panel and an over-the-counter remedy. I shall certainly cut back on the soda. And I will look for… Simethicone. Thank you for your time and attention, Doctor Pehrson. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Will someone be contacting me to schedule the blood panel?
DOCTOR: The lab information is on that slip. Go when you have time. And really, Mr. Goodstein, try not to worry about it. It's probably just gas. Next.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I understand. I will visit the lab as soon as possible. And I shall try not to worry. Again, thank you for seeing me. Have a good day, Doctor Pehrson. .
