DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were more cheerful. I’m here because… well, I haven't been myself lately. A bit down, you understand. I don't quite know where to begin, truthfully. I just feel… heavy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, so thank you for coming. “Heavy” is a good way to describe it. Let’s try to unpack that a little bit. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It hasn’t been sudden, you see. More of a… slow creep. Perhaps six months ago? Around the time of my grandson’s birthday, I think. Though, to be honest, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s frustrating, really. But I believe it was around then. Everything just… lost a bit of its colour.
DOCTOR: Six months… that gives us a good starting point. And it’s perfectly normal for things to feel a bit fuzzy sometimes, especially as time goes on. It sounds like this has been a gradual change, not a sudden event. Okay, so around six months ago you started noticing things felt less… vibrant. Can you tell me a bit more about how this “heaviness” manifests?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as though I’m constantly weeping, Doctor. It’s more… a lack of enjoyment. Things I used to find pleasure in… knitting, tending my garden, even a good film… they just don’t… spark anymore. I go through the motions, but the joy isn't there. And I've been… less inclined to socialize. My friends keep asking where I’ve been, and honestly, I haven’t much of an answer for them. Just… not feeling up to it, I suppose. It’s terribly unlike me.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It sounds like you're experiencing a loss of interest and pleasure in activities you normally enjoy, and a withdrawal from social interactions. Those are important things to mention. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Both, actually. My sleep… it’s fitful. I wake up frequently, and sometimes I just lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling. And my appetite… it’s diminished. I used to enjoy a hearty meal, but now… food just doesn’t appeal as much. I’ve lost some weight, my daughter tells me, though I haven’t bothered to check. I just… haven’t felt hungry, you see. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep and decreased appetite, along with the loss of enjoyment and social withdrawal. Those all fit together. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your concentration or memory, aside from what you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… frustrating. I used to be quite sharp, able to recall names and dates with ease. Now… I find myself forgetting things constantly. Misplacing items, struggling to follow conversations… it’s quite worrying. My daughter says I repeat myself sometimes, which is… rather embarrassing. It makes me feel… less myself, you understand. It’s not just the sadness, it’s this… fogginess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties – problems with memory and concentration. Those are definitely important things to note. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed with hypertension—high blood pressure—about fifteen years ago. It's well-managed with medication, thankfully. I also had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I made a full recovery. Other than that… nothing significant, I believe. I've always been rather… robust, you see. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication, and a history of pneumonia. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… oh, let me think. Sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. But that’s only as needed, you understand. I try to avoid it when possible, as it upsets my stomach. And… that’s it, I believe. Just the Lisinopril regularly, and Ibuprofen occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't believe so. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, perhaps that’s changing now, eh? It seems everything is changing now.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother lived to be 92, quite a remarkable woman. She suffered from arthritis, like myself, but otherwise remained healthy. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart condition. And… my only brother, he… struggled with anxiety for much of his life. He passed away several years ago. I don't believe there’s much history of… what you’re suggesting, though. No one I know suffered from… a prolonged sadness, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My mother instilled in me a strong aversion to it. And smoking? Absolutely not. Dreadful habit. And recreational drugs… well, that’s simply out of the question. I've always lived a very… temperate life, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a simple neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Please proceed. Though, I must warn you, my joints are rather stiff, so please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things slowly. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your gait is slightly unsteady, but you’re able to walk without assistance. And I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment. I’m just going to ask you a few simple questions about dates and current events. Okay, thank you. Based on the initial assessment, there aren't any immediate red flags, but your slightly unsteady gait and diminished reflexes warrant further investigation. Your memory appears a bit… foggy. It is likely related to the symptoms you are describing, but we should rule out other causes.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your diligence. Foggy, you say? Yes, that’s a good description. It’s not as though I'm completely lost, but things aren’t as… crisp as they once were. What sort of investigation are you thinking of? I hope it won’t be too… invasive. I’m not fond of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles. We’ll try to minimize any discomfort. I’m thinking a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels – particularly B12 and D – and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. We should also consider a CT scan of the brain to rule out any structural issues, but let’s start with the blood tests first. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, I suppose that’s reasonable. Better to be thorough, as you say. And a CT scan… oh dear. That sounds… rather daunting. Perhaps we can hold off on that for now? Unless you feel it's absolutely necessary. I’d prefer to see what the blood tests reveal first, if that’s possible. I truly don't relish the thought of being… scanned.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. You’re right to want to start with the less invasive tests. Let’s absolutely start with the blood work. We can review the results, and if they don’t provide a clear answer, then we can discuss the CT scan further. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests now. They should be able to draw them here at the clinic. It will take a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose antidepressant to help lift your mood. It’s not a sign of weakness, and it can often make a significant difference. It may take a few weeks to feel the full effect, so please be patient. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An antidepressant… hmm. I must admit, I’m a little hesitant. I’ve always prided myself on my strength, you see. To think I need assistance with my… spirits. But… if you believe it will help, I suppose I’m willing to try. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And yes, please proceed with the blood tests. The sooner we have answers, the better. Though, please be gentle with the needle. I do have a bit of a… aversion.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely. It takes courage to even consider medication, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit apprehensive. Think of it as assisting your body to restore its natural balance, rather than a sign of weakness. It’s about giving yourself a little help when you need it. I'll prescribe a low dose of Sertraline. It’s a commonly used antidepressant with relatively few side effects. I’ll also give you a pamphlet with information about the medication and potential side effects. Please read it carefully. If you experience any concerning side effects, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Now, the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very skilled and gentle. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything quite thoroughly. You've been very… understanding. Perhaps just one small question. What sort of side effects should I be looking out for? You mentioned some, but my memory… well, you know. I'd like to be prepared, if possible. And thank you again for your patience. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course. The most common side effects of Sertraline are nausea, diarrhea, and some sleep disturbance – either difficulty falling asleep or feeling a bit drowsy. Some people experience a decrease in libido, but that’s less common. It's also important to be aware that it can sometimes cause feelings of anxiety or agitation initially, but those usually subside within a week or two. The pamphlet lists all of the potential side effects in more detail. If you experience any severe side effects, like suicidal thoughts or a persistent feeling of hopelessness, please seek immediate medical attention. It’s rare, but it’s important to be aware of. Otherwise, if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We’re here to help. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you. You’ve… eased my mind considerably. Suicidal thoughts… that’s rather unsettling to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. I will be sure to call if anything… changes. I just hope this medication works. I long to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s a big step, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and hopeful at the same time. Many people find that antidepressants can make a significant difference, but it’s important to remember that it can take several weeks to feel the full effect. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and we can adjust the dosage if necessary. I have confidence that we can find a solution that works for you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Thank you for coming in today, Nani. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss the results of the blood tests and how you’re feeling.
