DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I've been getting this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a couple weeks now, and it’s… annoying, to say the least. I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears – that's what we call tinnitus. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two weeks. Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, but it's pretty constant now, if that makes sense? Like, there's always some level of ringing, sometimes it’s just quieter. I’m hoping it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant with varying intensity is definitely good information to have. And it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Let's try to get a better understanding of it. Could you describe the ringing itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? It’s hard. It’s like… a high-pitched whine, mostly. Sometimes it sounds like a buzzing, like a really faint electrical noise. It’s not loud, but it’s there, you know? It's hard to focus when it’s really noticeable. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at explaining things like this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly helpful, actually. A high-pitched whine or buzzing… and you’ve noticed it interferes with your concentration. It's common to have trouble describing these sounds. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it’s in your head?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes it feels like it’s bouncing between both, but it’s definitely stronger on the right side. It doesn’t feel like it’s deep inside my head, if that makes sense. More… just in the ear itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the right ear, feeling more in the ear itself, not deep within your head. Good. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Um… I think it gets worse when it's really quiet. Like, if I'm trying to sleep, or if I'm in a quiet room, it’s much more noticeable. Loud noises kinda… cover it up, I guess? But they don’t make it go away, just drown it out. I haven't noticed anything making it better, unfortunately. Just hoping it goes away on its own, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so quiet environments exacerbate it, and louder noises mask it. And nothing specifically alleviates it. Now, have you been exposed to any particularly loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of, really. I work as a waiter, so there's the usual restaurant noise, but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe a few loud parties lately, but I always try to stay away from the speakers. Nothing like a construction site or anything like that. I used to go to concerts a lot, but it’s been a while. A year or so maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, usual restaurant noise, some parties, but no recent significant noise exposure. Concerts a year ago… that's good to know. Before we proceed, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s about it. And I don't take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter stuff when I get a cold, like paracetamol. Oh, and I have private insurance, if that's relevant. It’s with… Pacific Health, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no regular medications, just occasional paracetamol for colds, and you have private insurance with Pacific Health. Good. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll just take a look in your ears, and do a quick hearing screening. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… hopefully it’s nothing too serious. I really just want to get back to normal, you know? I’m a bit anxious about this ringing.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and we'll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Alright, let’s start with your ears. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside. It doesn’t hurt, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… your ear canals appear clear. There’s no sign of any obvious wax buildup or infection. Your eardrums look normal as well. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing screening. I'll put headphones on you, and you just tell me when you hear a beep. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. A beep sounds easy enough. Hopefully I won't mess it up. Just let me know if I do anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and let me know when you hear the beep, not how loudly, just when you first detect it. Alright, screening complete. Findings: You have mild hearing loss in the higher frequencies in your right ear. It's not dramatic, but it is present. The left ear is within normal limits. This aligns with your report of the ringing being primarily in the right ear. I'll document that. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the screening, this is most likely tinnitus related to some degree of noise exposure. It can happen even without you realizing you've been exposed to loud sounds. The mild high-frequency hearing loss is consistent with that.
PATIENT: Okay… noise exposure. Even without realizing it? That’s… worrying. So what does that mean? Is there anything I can do about it? Will it get worse? I just want to get rid of the ringing, honestly. Is there a pill or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it's good you're asking these questions. It's not necessarily cause for major concern, but it’s important to address. "Noise exposure" doesn't always mean a concert or construction site. Prolonged exposure to even moderate noise can contribute. Your job as a waiter could be a factor, as well as those parties you mentioned. Unfortunately, there isn't a single "pill" to get rid of tinnitus. Most cases don't have a quick fix. However, there are several things we can do to manage it, and in many cases, people learn to live with it and it becomes less bothersome. We can explore some options. First, we should protect your ears from further noise exposure. Earplugs are a good start. Secondly, there's a therapy called tinnitus retraining therapy , which can help your brain filter out the sound. We can discuss a referral to an audiologist specializing in TRT. Thirdly, we can rule out other potential causes, just to be safe. A complete blood count and thyroid function test can help eliminate other possibilities. Finally, if the tinnitus is significantly impacting your quality of life, we can discuss options for managing anxiety and stress, which can sometimes worsen the symptoms. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay… earplugs, therapy, tests… that’s a lot. The tests sound okay, I guess. I’m just worried about the therapy… does it actually work? And is it expensive? I’m divorced, so… money’s a little tight. I think earplugs are a good place to start, definitely. And maybe the blood tests. I just don't know about the therapy yet. Could we hold off on that for now, and see if the earplugs help?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a very reasonable approach. We can definitely start with earplugs and the blood tests. There’s no need to rush into anything you’re not comfortable with. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes like anemia or thyroid issues. I’ll write you a requisition for those. You can get them done at any local lab. I'll also give you a prescription for custom-fitted earplugs. These are more comfortable and effective than the foam ones. I’ll also provide you with some informational pamphlets about tinnitus and noise protection. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to discuss the test results and see how the earplugs are working. If the tinnitus hasn't improved, or if it gets worse, we can revisit the therapy option. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Six weeks to try the earplugs, and then see where we’re at. That gives me a little bit of hope, I think. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything really well. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or should I just go get the blood tests done and then come back in six weeks?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. No, that's it for today. Just get the blood tests done at your convenience, and then we'll see you back in six weeks. The receptionist will book you in before you leave. Here are the requisitions and the pamphlets. And a list of local audiologists if you decide you'd like to research TRT further. If you experience any sudden changes in your hearing, or if the tinnitus gets significantly worse before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. You've been really helpful. I appreciate your patience. I think I’ll go talk to the receptionist now and get everything scheduled. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you have a good day too. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. .
