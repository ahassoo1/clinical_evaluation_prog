DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Nadene! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough, you see. It just won’t go away. Been hacking for weeks now. It’s worse when I lie down, and it feels… heavy, if that makes sense. My heart, it isn’t what it used to be, and I worry it’s getting worse with all this coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been lingering for weeks and feels worse when you lie down, and you're understandably concerned about it affecting your heart. That is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn't really bring anything up, if you know what I mean. No phlegm, no… stuff. Just a dry, raspy cough. It starts as a tickle, then gets worse and worse until I have to really push it out. And like I said, lying flat makes it ten times worse. I usually sleep propped up with a lot of pillows. It wakes me up at night, too. Every few hours, I have to get up because I’m coughing so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a dry cough, no mucus production, and it's significantly worse when you lie down, disrupting your sleep. That's helpful to know. And just to clarify – when did this cough start roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, oh, goodness… probably about a month ago now. Maybe a little longer. It was just a little tickle at first, I didn't think much of it. I thought it was just a little cold or something. But it just kept getting worse and worse, and now… well, now it's this. I remember it being around the time of my grandson’s birthday, which was July 2nd. He turned eight. A good boy, that one. Always visits.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been about a month, starting around July 2nd. And it began as a mild tickle and gradually worsened. Do you remember if anything happened around that time that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggered it. Not that I recall, really. I hadn't been sick, hadn't been around anyone sick. The weather was… well, it's been hot, you know? Maybe the heat? I do try to drink plenty of water, but it’s been so humid, hard to stay cool. I hadn’t traveled anywhere, hadn’t started any new hobbies or anything. Just the usual, cooking for my family. Maybe it just came on its own. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear trigger that you can recall. And you haven't been sick or exposed to anyone sick recently. Let's talk about other symptoms. Besides the cough, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I get a little… breathless sometimes. Not all the time, but when I walk even a short distance, like to the mailbox, I find myself getting winded. And my ankles… they swell up at the end of the day. They haven't been too bad, but noticeable. Also, I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, even after a good night’s sleep – well, as good as it gets with all this coughing. I do get a little dizzy now and then too, but I thought that was just my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, increased fatigue, and occasional dizziness. That's quite a bit to consider. Do you have any pain anywhere – chest pain, back pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes I feel a little…tightness in my chest, but it’s not a sharp pain, more like a…pressure, maybe? It comes and goes, and it’s not too bad. Like someone is sitting on my chest, but a light someone. I’ve had this heart checked before, you know. Years ago. They gave me some medicine, and it helped for a while. I still take it, every day. Can’t remember the name of it now… old age, you know. But it's a little white pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild chest tightness, but no sharp pain. And you're already taking medication for your heart, a small white pill. I’ll need to check your records to see what that medication is. Ah, here we are. You’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Besides your heart, do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a little bit of diabetes, type 2, the doctor said. I try to watch my sugar, but sometimes it's hard, you know? I like my plantains. And my knees are bad. Arthritis, they say. Makes it hard to get around sometimes, which doesn’t help with the breathlessness. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. But that was a long time ago, no trouble with that now. Is that everything? I probably forget something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have type 2 diabetes, arthritis in your knees, and you had your gallbladder removed previously. And you're managing your diabetes, but find it challenging sometimes. That’s all helpful information. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long story. My mother… she had a weak heart, too. She passed away when I was still young. My father, he lived a long life, but he had high blood pressure. And my brother, he had diabetes, like me. He wasn't as good at taking care of himself, though. It seems to run in the family, this sort of thing. It's always something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes. That's important to know. And finally, let’s talk about social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, goodness, I can’t even remember. Not since my husband passed away, that's for sure. Years ago now. I mostly just stay home and cook, you know? My family visits when they can. It’s a quiet life, but it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't smoke or drink alcohol. A quiet life at home with family visits. That’s good to know. Now, before I listen to your lungs and heart, let’s quickly review allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of medicines over the years, and never had a problem. As for medication, I told you about the Lisinopril for my heart, 20 milligrams every day. And I take Metformin for my diabetes, maybe 500 milligrams twice a day, but I forget sometimes. I just take it when I remember. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Lisinopril 20mg daily for your heart, and Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes – though not always consistently taken. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything. It’s a little difficult getting old, you know? Everything creaks and groans. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. I’ll be gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a bit fast, around 98 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight murmur. Your lungs have some crackles at the base, both sides, which could indicate some fluid buildup. I'm going to tap on your chest now. This helps me assess the underlying structures. Your lungs sound a little dull at the bases, which again supports the possibility of some fluid. Now, let’s check your ankles. You have some moderate swelling in both ankles. And your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/85. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I'm concerned about potential heart failure, exacerbated by fluid retention. The crackles in your lungs, ankle swelling, and elevated blood pressure are all consistent with that. It's also important to consider your diabetes and ensure it’s well-controlled, as that can also contribute to these symptoms. I want to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure… That sounds serious. My mother… she had something similar, I think. Yes, of course, whatever tests you think are necessary. Blood tests and a chest X-ray… alright. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. I just want to feel better. And to be able to sleep at night again. Is it… is it bad? Will I need to be in the hospital?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re getting it checked out. We’re still gathering information, so it’s too early to say definitively. The tests will help us understand the extent of the problem and determine the best course of action. It could require hospitalization, depending on the results, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. I’ll also want to review your diabetes medication and potentially adjust it to better control your blood sugar. And we should discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your salt intake and monitoring your fluid intake. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the tests and schedule the chest X-ray. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just… what kind of lifestyle modifications are we talking about? Salt… I like my cooking. And fluid… well, I always have a glass of water nearby. It sounds… difficult. Will I have to stop cooking altogether?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern – it can feel overwhelming. We're not talking about drastic changes, just mindful adjustments. Regarding salt, it’s not about completely eliminating it, but reducing your intake. We'll aim for less than 2000 milligrams per day. You can achieve that by being careful with processed foods, using less salt when cooking, and reading food labels. We can also discuss some salt substitutes. As for fluids, it’s about limiting your intake to around 1.5 to 2 liters per day to help prevent fluid buildup. I know you like to stay hydrated, but too much fluid can worsen your symptoms. And definitely not stopping cooking! We can find ways to modify your recipes to make them healthier without sacrificing the flavor you enjoy. Perhaps we can talk to a dietician who can help you with some meal planning?
PATIENT: A dietician? That sounds… helpful. Yes, I think that would be good. Someone to help me figure out how to still cook my favorite dishes. Alright. Salt, fluids… and a dietician. I can try. As long as I can still make my plantains. When will I hear about the test results? And where should I go for the dietician?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, and yes, we can absolutely work around your plantains! The blood test results should be back within a couple of days, and we'll call you as soon as we have them. The chest X-ray results usually come back a bit quicker. The nurse will give you a call tomorrow to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. As for the dietician, we have one on staff, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. Her schedule is quite full, but the nurse can also get you a referral to an external dietician if needed. I’ll have her give you all the information you need. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – increased shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, or any chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little bit better knowing there’s a plan. I’ll wait for the nurse to call about the follow-up and the dietician. And I’ll be careful with the salt and fluids. And if things get worse, I’ll go to the emergency room. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we're in this together. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
