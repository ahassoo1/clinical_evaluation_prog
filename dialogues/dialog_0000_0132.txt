DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's this heat, really. Can't stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building, painting… now? Forget about it. Feel like I'm gonna melt just walking to the car. It’s ridiculous. Never been like this before.
DOCTOR: Heat intolerance, you say. And this is a new development?
PATIENT: New as in, the last couple of summers. But this year? It’s worse. Much worse. I mean, I'm a hardy man, you know? Lived in the mountains most of my life. This isn’t some city-slicker complaining about a little warm weather. It’s… oppressive. Makes my head spin, honestly. And I sweat like a… well, a lot. More than usual, even for hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excessive sweating with dizziness... and you said this is progressively worse over the last two summers. Any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My legs feel… heavy, sometimes. Like they’re filled with lead. Not all the time, just after I've been out in the sun for a bit. And I get really thirsty, even if I’ve been drinking water all day. It’s a… dry thirst. Does that make sense? Not like a refreshing thirst, but… like I’m just sucking the moisture out of the air. And I haven't been sleeping well either, too hot to sleep. But that could just be the heat.
DOCTOR: Heavy legs, excessive thirst – a ‘dry thirst’ as you describe it – and difficulty sleeping. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. Still eat my dal bhat, same as always. Maybe not as much when it's really hot, but that’s just common sense, isn't it? Don't fancy a big meal when you’re sweating buckets. But no, haven't lost my taste for it or anything. I’m a practical man, doctor. I eat to live, not live to eat, you know? This isn't some delicate condition. I just want to be able to work again without feeling like I'm gonna pass out.
DOCTOR: Right, practical. Okay. Let’s go through some basics then. Any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… My father, he had a bit of trouble with his blood pressure towards the end, I think. Not sure, didn’t pay much attention to that sort of thing back then. We were too busy doing things. My mother was strong as an ox, never sick a day in her life. Nothing else, really. We weren’t a family for sitting around talking about illnesses. Just… got on with it. But the blood pressure, maybe? He did get a bit… puffy around the ankles, now that I think of it. But he was getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible family history of hypertension. And you yourself, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Never. Not once. I’ve only been to the doctor a handful of times in my life. Broke my arm when I was a boy, that’s about it. And a bad flu once, but you don’t need a doctor for a bit of the flu, do you? I take care of myself. Eat good food, work hard, get plenty of fresh air. That’s all you need. This heat… this is something new. It’s not something I brought on myself.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s just do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can talk about some possible causes. It's good you take care of yourself, but sometimes even healthy people experience changes. It's best to rule things out. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Roll up my sleeve, eh? Fine. But don’t go poking around too much. I’ve got work to do, you know. And I’m telling you, it’s this heat. It's different this year. Really different. Just get on with it. The sooner I know it's nothing serious, the sooner I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your pulse is a little fast, but not alarming. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142/88. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's faint, but worth noting. Murmur isn't loud but could be related. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Supplements? No. Never. What would I need those for? I eat my vegetables, that’s enough. And I certainly don't go swallowing pills just because some advertisement tells me to. This… this murmur, you say? Is that serious? Sounds complicated. Look, I’m a simple man, doctor. Just tell me if I can go back to work or not. I don't need fancy medical terms and complicated explanations. Is it something this heat brought on?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, it's good you're so resilient, but dismissing potential issues isn't the best approach. The murmur is subtle, and could be harmless, but we need to investigate further. The elevated blood pressure and your symptoms – the heat intolerance, excessive sweating, heavy legs, and dry thirst – could be related to several things. It's unlikely this heat caused the murmur, but it could be exacerbating your symptoms. I'm not saying you absolutely can't work, but I would advise against strenuous activity until we have more information. I'd like to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart function. I also recommend a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist for a more detailed evaluation of the murmur. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Tests? Look, I’ve got deadlines, people depending on me. This is a waste of time and money. I’m telling you, it's the heat. Just give me something for the sweating and I’ll be fine. A fan, maybe? I don't need to be poked and prodded by a specialist. I'm perfectly capable of knowing my own limits. This is ridiculous. No tests. No cardiologist. Just tell me what I can do to get back to work. This is starting to feel like you’re not listening to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I am listening to you. And I understand your frustration. However, as your doctor, my priority is your health and safety. Dismissing potential issues based on your own assessment, while admirable, isn't responsible medical care. The combination of your symptoms and the findings during the examination warrant further investigation. I am not suggesting you have a serious condition, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. While a fan might provide temporary relief, it won't address the root of the problem. I understand your concerns about time and cost, and I will do my best to expedite the process. However, I strongly recommend the tests and the cardiology consultation. I won't prescribe anything for the sweating without knowing the underlying cause. If you absolutely refuse, I can document your refusal in your chart, but I will strongly advise against strenuous activity. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I feel a strong responsibility to advise you to prioritize a thorough evaluation. Are you willing to reconsider the tests and consultation, even just to put your mind at ease?
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m telling you, this is a waste of time. And if it turns out to be nothing, you’re getting an earful. But… alright. Tests. Consultation. But make it quick. And no unnecessary poking around, understand? I've got work to do, and I don’t have all day to spend in waiting rooms. Just get it over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I appreciate you reconsidering. I assure you, I'll do my best to expedite the process. First, the lab tests. I'll write you a requisition for a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and it should only take about 30 minutes. They’ll draw some blood. Second, I’ll get a referral scheduled for a cardiology consultation. I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma; she’s excellent. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. It might take a week or two to get in. In the meantime, I advise you to limit strenuous activity, stay hydrated, and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll also give you a written summary of these instructions and the requisition for the lab. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… get it done. And tell Dr. Sharma I don't have time for a lot of chatter. I need a quick diagnosis, not a life story. Alright, I'll go get the blood drawn. But if this turns out to be nothing, I’m letting everyone know you wasted my time. Thank you… I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Get well soon. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any changes in your condition. .
