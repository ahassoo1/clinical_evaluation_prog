DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s about my… complexion. It’s darkening. And I feel quite tired, naturally. At my age, one expects a certain… decline. But this is… noticeable. I haven’t much time for this, Doctor. Let’s be quick, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, I understand you want to be brief. Darkening complexion and fatigue… Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this darkening?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Perhaps a month ago? Two? It’s difficult to say. I work, I sleep, I eat… the days blend. Is it truly necessary to pinpoint the exact date? My wife noticed it, of course. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. A rough estimate is fine. And is this darkening all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on my face, I suppose. And my arms. The places the sun… gets to. Though I’m careful. Relatively careful. I don’t spend hours baking in the heat, you know. I have… responsibilities. It’s not a uniform shade, if that matters. And frankly, Doctor, I'm not a dermatologist. I’m a practical man. I work with iron, not… pigments.
DOCTOR: Alright, so darkening primarily on the face and arms, not uniform… Have you noticed any other changes along with the darkening?
PATIENT: Changes? At 85? What hasn't changed? My knees ache more, my memory… is not what it once was, clearly. But specifically? No, I can't say I've observed anything… remarkable. Perhaps a slight… thirst. But I always drink water. It's common sense, really. This is all rather… tedious, Doctor. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Aches, memory… and increased thirst. Okay. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalized recently?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Good heavens, no! I’m a sturdy man, Doctor. I’ve never needed… coddling. A few colds, perhaps, a touch of the flu… nothing that requires a visit to… that place. I’ve been perfectly capable of tending to myself. And my wife, naturally. She's very… meticulous about hygiene. No, no hospitals. Absolutely not. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent hospitalizations. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? A small something for my blood pressure, years ago. The doctor insisted. I don't take it religiously. It lowers my energy, you see. I need that for work. Besides, it didn't seem to be doing much good anyway. My wife handles the pills, mostly. I just… get on with things. It’s a small blue one, I think. Or maybe white. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to such details. It's not important. Let's move on.
DOCTOR: Small blue or white pill for blood pressure, not taken regularly. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve eaten things, breathed things, been stung by things. If I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now. No, I don't have allergies. It's a waste of time to dwell on hypothetical sensitivities. Now, are we finished here? I have work to do, you see. Iron doesn't reinforce itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be swift, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And do try not to… poke too much. I'm a delicate man, despite appearances. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 150/90. A little elevated. And your pulse is 72, regular. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, a little muffled, but within acceptable limits for your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Skin is… hyperpigmented, as you mentioned, particularly on sun-exposed areas. No lesions or unusual findings. Palpating your lymph nodes… no swelling detected. Now, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but that's common at your age. Overall, you seem to be in relatively stable condition, considering… everything.
PATIENT: Well? Is it something serious? I trust you have a diagnosis. I haven't the patience for vague observations and… murmurs. Just tell me what’s wrong, Doctor. And how long will it take to fix it. I have commitments, you know. Important commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it’s difficult to give a definitive diagnosis without further testing. The darkening of your skin, along with the fatigue and thirst, could be a number of things. One possibility is simply age-related changes – sun damage and natural pigmentation changes. However, given your fatigue and increased thirst, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as adrenal insufficiency or, less likely, an underlying medical condition. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an adrenal function test. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated and try to get some rest when you can. Also, it would be a good idea to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can give you a device.
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Doctor, this is becoming ridiculous. I’m an old man, not a specimen. And "monitor my blood pressure"? I haven't time for such… fancies. Honestly. Look, I appreciate your… efforts, but I think I’ll just manage it myself. I’ve been managing things for 85 years, I think I can handle a bit of darkening and tiredness. Just… forget the tests. It's a waste of time and money. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just old age, as I said before. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your reluctance, but I strongly advise against dismissing these symptoms without further investigation. While it could be nothing serious, it's important to rule out anything potentially concerning. I’m concerned about the fatigue and thirst, especially given your elevated blood pressure. I can at least provide you with some resources on managing your blood pressure, and recommend a follow-up appointment in a month to reassess. But I really urge you to reconsider the blood tests. Here's some information to take with you. Please, call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms – increased weakness, dizziness, or confusion. .
