DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… keeps coming back. And I seem to be getting water infections quite a bit lately. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Recurring pain and frequent water infections – that definitely warrants a closer look. Let’s start with the pain in your side. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… well, it’s on my right side, mostly. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you understand? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times it’s quite uncomfortable. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific… eating, moving, nothing like that. Just… appears.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on your right side that comes and goes, and doesn't seem to be related to any specific activity. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… I suppose it's been… at least a year now. Maybe longer. It started off very mild, and I just put it down to getting older, you know? But it’s definitely been getting more frequent these past few months. And that’s when I started worrying about it, and decided to come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if it started mild and progressed slowly. A year of intermittent right-sided pain is something we need to investigate. Now, you also mentioned frequent water infections. How often would you say you're experiencing those?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s probably every couple of months now. Sometimes a bit more often, sometimes less. I always go to the doctor when I feel one coming on, and they give me antibiotics, and it clears up. But then it just comes back again. It's a bit of a cycle, you see? I suppose it’s been like that for… oh, maybe six months or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly every couple of months for the past six months. And each time you see your doctor, you're treated with antibiotics and it resolves temporarily. Do you remember what your doctor said about the cause of the infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… to be honest, not really. They just said it was a water infection, gave me the medicine, and told me to drink plenty of water. I don’t recall them saying anything specific about why I keep getting them. I suppose I didn’t push it, you see? I just assumed it was something old age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to not remember all the details, especially if the explanation was brief. Recurrent UTIs definitely need further investigation to determine the underlying cause. Okay, let's switch gears for a moment. Aside from the pain and the infections, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not constantly exhausted, but just… lacking energy. And I’ve been going to the toilet a bit more often, even when I don’t feel the urge. It’s not a huge amount, just… more frequent trips. It’s hard to say if that’s related to the water infections, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and more frequent urination. Those could be related to the UTIs, or they could be separate issues. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A few years ago, the doctor told me I have… something with my kidneys. Polycystic something, I think? They said I have lots of little sacs on my kidneys. It wasn’t causing any problems at the time, so they just told me to keep an eye on it. I don’t really understand all the medical terms, you see? I just remember it involved my kidneys and lots of little bubbles.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That’s important information. Do you remember approximately when you were diagnosed with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must have been… about ten years ago, I reckon. Maybe a little longer. I had a scan done when I was feeling unwell, and that’s when they found it. They explained it all, but as I said, it didn’t cause any problems then, so I didn’t really pay much attention to the details. Just remembered it was something to do with my kidneys.
DOCTOR: Okay, about ten years ago. And it wasn't causing any symptoms at the time. That's alright, it’s not a test on remembering medical details. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any surgeries, no. I've been quite lucky, thankfully. Just the usual things, you know? Doctor visits for colds and flu, but nothing serious enough to require an operation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart, I believe. But other than that, not that I’m aware of. We weren’t a very close family, you see? Didn’t really talk about medical things. I suppose it’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your father. And now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Never liked the smell of it, you see? My wife… she used to smoke, but she gave it up years ago. I always encouraged her to, and thankfully she did.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had any for a while now. Not since… well, not since my wife passed away. I just don’t have the same appetite for it anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'm sorry for your loss. Now, finally, let’s talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. As for medications, I just take a tablet for my blood pressure, that’s all. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. It’s a small, white tablet, I think. I can't recall the name of it, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and a tablet for blood pressure, name unknown. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Espinueva. That gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your vital signs. This will help me narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, please. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Lung sounds are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. This might be a little uncomfortable, so please let me know if you feel any pain. Hmm… there's some mild tenderness in your right lower quadrant. And I’m noting some fullness in that area as well. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88. Overall, your vitals are slightly elevated, and there's tenderness in your right lower quadrant. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease and recurrent UTIs, it’s important to investigate further. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count to start. And given the tenderness, I think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be helpful to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate everything so carefully. A CT scan sounds a bit daunting, but if it’s what’s needed to find out what’s causing this pain, then yes, please go ahead. Urinalysis and blood tests too, of course. Whatever you recommend. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good you want to be proactive. A CT scan can sound a little intimidating, but it’s the best way to visualize the organs in your abdomen and pelvis and identify any potential problems. I'll write the orders for the urinalysis, complete blood count, and CT scan. The lab can draw the blood here, and you can schedule the CT scan at the imaging center across town. They'll likely want to discuss the scan with you beforehand to ensure you don't have any contraindications. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s important to continue drinking plenty of fluids to help prevent further UTIs. And if you experience any fever, worsening pain, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Drinking plenty of fluids, and watching out for fever… I can do that. And I’ll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I feel a bit better already, just knowing we're doing something to find out what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we'll discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's a summary of our plan and the orders for the tests. I’ll also have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once we have the results back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A follow-up appointment in a week… excellent. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think that’s all for now. I’ll go and schedule that CT scan and look forward to hearing from you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and care. You have a good day as well.
