DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Billman. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as I understand it, I’m here to get… cleared, is the word? For a senior living place. My niece, bless her heart, thinks it’s time I had a bit less space to worry over. Just want to make sure I'm fit enough, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-placement exam. Yes, that’s… sensible, I suppose. Plenty of places require those. Okay, let’s get some information down. You said your niece suggested this… how long have you been considering this senior living option?
PATIENT: Oh, not long at all, really. Just a few weeks now. She’s been talking about it for a bit, but it’s only recently I’ve started to… think about it seriously. It's a big change, you understand. I’ve lived in my own place for a good long time, and… well, it feels strange to even think about moving. But she worries, and I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is a significant adjustment. We’ll get through it. Alright. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I’ve always believed in a good check-up. I had Doctor Henderson for… oh, goodness, nearly thirty years. He retired a couple of years back, though. Been going to Doctor Schmidt since then. Regular visits, yearly physicals, that sort of thing. Nothing… major, thankfully. Mostly just the usual aches and pains for an old man.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me pull up your records from Doctor Schmidt… Ah, here we are. Okay, I see yearly physicals, some blood pressure monitoring… anything specifically diagnosed?
PATIENT: Let me think… Doctor Schmidt did mention a touch of arthritis in my hands, a few years back. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. He gave me some cream for it, and it helps. And… oh, he said my cholesterol was a little high, so I've been trying to eat better. Not always successful, I confess, but I try.
DOCTOR: “Trying” is good. We'll need to see some recent labs, though, to get a clear picture. Do you remember when you last had blood work done?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it was in March. Yes, March 12th, I recall because it was my birthday. Doctor Schmidt always scheduled it close to my birthday. He was a thoughtful man. I have a copy of the results at home, if you’d like. My niece helps me keep things organized, you see.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful. While we're at it, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a few things, Doctor. I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, as you likely saw in the records. And I take ibuprofen now and then for my arthritis, when the pain is bad. And… well, I take a daily vitamin. A general one. Can’t hurt, I always thought. My niece keeps track of those, too. She’s very good with details.
DOCTOR: Right. Lisinopril, ibuprofen PRN, multivitamin… Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been lucky in that regard, I suppose. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I did get a bad rash once, when I was a boy, from poison ivy, but that wasn't a medication. Just a plant, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Standard procedure. Do you mind if I take a look at your hands as well, given the arthritis?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, proceed. I understand it’s all part of making sure I’m fit enough for this move. My hands do bother me some days, so examining them is a good idea. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgement, sir.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Not concerning, but we’ll document it. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let me take a look at your ears… Okay, a little wax buildup, but nothing major. Now, your hands... Moderate swelling in the knuckles, some visible joint deformity. Range of motion is… limited. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: There. It’s… not as easy as it used to be, you see. The pain flares up when I try to squeeze too hard. It's mostly just stiffness, though. I can still manage most things. It’s just… slower, that’s all. I can still bake, thankfully. That’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Moderate swelling, limited range of motion, pain with grip. We’ll need to consider that when looking at your overall suitability for the senior living facility. Do you have any difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not at all. I walk just fine. I used to go for long walks out in the hills, before my knees started to bother me a little. Now I mostly stick to shorter walks around town. But my balance is good. I haven’t fallen or stumbled in years, thank goodness. I’m still steady on my feet, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. We’ve covered quite a bit. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, you’re… generally stable, but there are a few areas that need to be addressed. We’ll need to review those recent labs to get a better handle on your cholesterol and kidney function, and we need to consider the arthritis in your hands and its impact on your daily activities. Before we proceed, have you had a recent cognitive assessment?
PATIENT: A… cognitive assessment? Oh, goodness. No, sir. I don’t believe so. Doctor Schmidt never mentioned anything about that. My niece hasn’t said anything either. I’ve always felt… sharp, you see. I can still remember things perfectly. Dates, names, faces… It’s all clear as a bell. But… if it's standard procedure, I suppose I don’t mind. I trust your judgement, Doctor. What exactly does it involve?
DOCTOR: It’s just a brief series of questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Many facilities require it as part of the admission process, especially for independent living. It’s… a precaution. We have a short form here, it shouldn’t take more than five minutes. We’ll just start with your date of birth, if you don’t mind…
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No trouble at all. August 14th, 1944. I remember it well. It was a hot summer day, and my mother had just finished baking a cherry pie. Though, now that I think about it… it might have been blueberry. She made a lot of pies that summer. But the date is correct, I'm certain of that.
DOCTOR: Right. August 14th. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. It is 2025. August 2nd, to be precise. A warm day, not as hot as my mother's summers, thankfully. I keep track of the date, you see. Important to know what day it is, keeps things in order.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a tricky one. I try not to pay too much attention to politics, you see. It all seems so… contentious these days. Let me think… Is it still Mr. Biden? Yes, I believe it is Mr. Biden. Joseph Biden, if I recall correctly. Though I could be wrong. I don't keep up with those things as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Based on what we've discussed and this brief assessment, I recommend a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. And given the arthritis, I'd like to have you seen by a physical therapist to assess your functional limitations. I’m also going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a complete blood count. We’ll need those results before we can proceed further. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… a lot. A comprehensive evaluation? A physical therapist? I had hoped it would be simpler, you see. But… if it's necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgement, Doctor. My niece will likely have questions, though. She's very thorough. And… where do I go for these things? And who do I talk to about the cost? I have private insurance, as I mentioned. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, all at once.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take it one step at a time. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for the cognitive evaluation with Dr. Ramirez – she’s the specialist we use here. And I'll write a referral for the physical therapy assessment with Ms. Jensen. She'll evaluate your range of motion and help determine if you need any assistive devices. The receptionist will also verify your insurance coverage for both assessments. I’ll need to see the bloodwork results before making any final recommendations regarding your suitability for independent living. Here’s a printed summary of today’s visit and the necessary referrals. Please schedule those appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any other immediate concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A lot of information, yes. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain it all. I’ll let my niece handle the scheduling, she’s much better at these things. And thank you for the summary, that’s very helpful. No, I don’t think I have any other concerns at the moment. Just… a little worried, I suppose. Moving is a big change, and all these tests… it feels a bit like I’m being… scrutinized. But I understand you're just doing your job, Doctor. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Right. Just standard procedure, Mr. Tkac. We need to ensure you're safe and can manage independently. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
