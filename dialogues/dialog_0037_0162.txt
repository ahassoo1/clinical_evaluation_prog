DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for pleasantries, Doc. Just… my stomach’s been puffed up. Like a balloon. It’s annoying, alright? Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re experiencing abdominal distension and you’d like to get to the bottom of it. I appreciate you being direct. “A bit now” can mean different things to different people, could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Roughly? Ugh… a few weeks, maybe? Honestly, it all kinda blends together. Work's been busy, you know? Pile driving doesn’t exactly leave you time to catalog your… internal feelings. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it doesn’t feel right. Like there’s too much… stuff in there. Does that make sense? I don’t know medical terms, obviously.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds frustrating to have something ongoing that’s interfering with your work and daily life. A few weeks is helpful to know. And no need to apologize for not knowing medical terms – that’s what I’m here for. When you say "too much stuff," can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Look, it’s just… full. Like I ate way too much, but I haven’t. And… gassy. Lots of gas. It’s embarrassing, honestly. I’m a grown man, not a teenager. It’s not… dignified. I don't know what else to tell you. It’s just… bloated. Like a freaking beach ball. Is that helpful? Seriously, just fix it, Doc. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, fullness, and increased gas – I'm getting a clearer picture. And I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. We'll try to figure this out as efficiently as possible. To help me narrow down the possibilities, can you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger the bloating or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. Like I said, work keeps me pretty busy. I eat when I can, usually something quick. Sandwiches, maybe. Sometimes I grab something from that diner down the road. It’s all pretty standard. I don’t go out of my way to eat anything… fancy. Doesn't matter what it is, really. It just… happens. Though, I did have some… beans, a few days ago. Maybe that did something? I don't know. I'm not a food scientist.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem consistently linked to anything specific in your diet, and the beans might have been a factor. That’s good information. Now, aside from the bloating and gas, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kinda symptoms? Look, I told you about the stomach, alright? It’s puffed up. That’s the main thing. I haven’t been throwing up or anything. No… changes in… bathroom habits, if you wanna know. Just… uncomfortable. And tired, I guess. Work's tiring, naturally. But maybe… more tired than usual. I don’t know. Really, it's just the stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no vomiting, no changes in bowel habits, just bloating and increased fatigue. That’s helpful. When you say fatigue, is it a general feeling of being worn down, or more like weakness?
PATIENT: Worn down, I suppose. Like… I finish work and just want to collapse. Usually I can at least watch some TV or something. But lately… I just sleep. And even then, I don't feel rested. It's… annoying. I got things to do, alright? I can’t be spending all my time sleeping. Pile driving isn’t exactly a job you can do on empty, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right, pile driving requires a lot of energy. Okay, so fatigue could be related, or it could be separate. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. Honestly, Doc, I don't really… keep track of that stuff. I had… something with my stomach a few years back. But it was years ago. They gave me some pills, it went away. That’s all I remember. And… my wife… she handled all the doctor stuff. It's been a while. I’m widowed, you know? I’m not good with… details.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. That’s perfectly alright, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s common to have difficulty recalling details, especially after a significant life event. Do you happen to remember what that stomach issue was, even roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Something about… acid? Or ulcers, maybe? Like I said, it was years ago. I took some pills, it went away, and I didn't think about it again. It wasn’t… serious, as far as I know. They didn’t keep me in the hospital or anything. Just… a few pills. I’m really not good with this stuff, Doc. Can’t we just… fix the bloating?
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of acid or ulcer issues treated with medication. I’m noting that. We will get to fixing the bloating. To help me rule things out, and since you mentioned the previous stomach issue, have you ever had an endoscopy or colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Endo… what now? Colon…oscopy? Look, Doc, you're losing me. I told you, my wife handled all this stuff. I just went to the doctor when she told me to, and took the pills she gave me. I don't know about fancy procedures with… scopes. I'm a pile driver, not a medical professional. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time here. Can't you just give me something for the bloating?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. You're right, I'm asking a lot of questions about your past medical history, and it's clear it's not something you're comfortable with. We can focus on the current issue. I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your abdomen. Just so I can get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I got stuff to do. Don’t poke around too much, alright? And tell me what you find, if anything. No medical jargon, though. Just… plain English.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Take a few deep breaths for me. I do notice some mild distension, as you described. There’s some air in the abdomen, and it’s a little bit tender to the touch in the lower abdomen, but nothing concerningly sharp. No obvious masses. Your bowel sounds are present, which is good. It doesn't sound like anything is blocked. It’s also a little bit firm. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything obvious. Everything sounds clear there as well.
PATIENT: Air? Firm? Look, you're just telling me things I don't understand. So… what does that mean? Is it serious? Am I gonna need surgery? Just tell me straight, Doc. I don't have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I understand your concern and I apologize if I used terms that weren’t clear. “Air” just means there’s extra gas in your stomach and intestines, which explains the bloating. “Firm” means your abdomen feels a little bit more solid than usual, which can happen with distension and gas. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it doesn’t sound like anything immediately serious, and I don’t believe you need surgery. It’s likely related to gas and possibly some mild digestive upset. However, since you’ve had stomach issues in the past, and because of the fatigue you're experiencing, I’d like to run a few simple blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes. This will give us a clearer picture and make sure we’re not missing anything. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh, fine. Whatever it takes. Just… can’t this be done quickly? I got a schedule to keep. And tell me what you're looking for, in plain English, alright? No fancy medical terms. I just want this bloating gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. We can definitely work quickly. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, and a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and your electrolyte levels. We’ll also check a thyroid test to see if that’s playing a role in your fatigue. Basically, we’re just looking to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms, or contributing to them. It's a standard set of tests, and it shouldn’t take long. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. After the tests, we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan to get that bloating under control. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And don't make me come back for more tests if you can help it. I’m a busy man, Doc. Really busy. And tell that lab tech to be quick, alright? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. I’ll make a note of your concerns. I’ll personally let the lab tech know you’re on a tight schedule. Here’s a lab requisition. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of you. They’ll need a small blood sample. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of hours – you can come back, and we'll discuss them. Or, if you prefer, we can schedule a quick follow-up appointment for tomorrow morning. Would you prefer that?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning. Definitely tomorrow morning. I don’t wanna waste any more time than I have to. Just… get it done. And hopefully, you’ll have some answers. If you don't, I’m gonna be very unhappy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. Let's get you scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. That should give the lab enough time to get the results back. Okay, you're all set. 9:00 AM tomorrow. In the meantime, try to avoid any foods that seem to make the bloating worse, and stay hydrated. If your symptoms get significantly worse—severe pain, vomiting, fever—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get this bloating fixed. That’s all I ask. Alright, I’m gonna go. Thanks… I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM.
