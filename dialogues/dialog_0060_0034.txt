DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi. Thanks. Um... I just moved here, actually. And I guess... I need to get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, and someone said I should come see you. It's, like, a check-up, I think? I don't really... remember everything.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient check-up. That's perfectly fine. It's good you're getting things sorted so quickly after moving. We'll get everything documented and make sure you're healthy. I see you have Medicare, excellent. And you said you just moved to the area?
PATIENT: Yeah, just moved. Um… a few weeks ago? From… somewhere. It was… a long drive. Not too far, I don't think. It's all kinda blurry, honestly. Sorry! I just... don't have a good memory for places.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about it. It happens. We’ll focus on what’s important now. So, let's start with a little bit of background. I see your age is 21, and your height and weight are listed as 150 and 82, is that correct?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, I guess so. Those numbers sound right... I haven't really checked in a while. I mostly just... work. Does that matter? I mean, the numbers?
DOCTOR: Well, it's helpful information, of course. It gives me a baseline. But we can always recheck if you’re concerned. Let’s not dwell on it for now. You mentioned you work. What kind of work do you do, Emileigh?
PATIENT: Oh! Um... I'm a... a technician. Mechanical stuff. Like, fixing things and... building things. It's kinda hard to explain. I work with... machines. Is that good enough? It's at a shop, not too far from here, I think.
DOCTOR: Right, a mechanical technician. Good to know. A physical job, then?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty physical. Lots of... lifting and stuff. And sometimes it's kinda loud. It's okay, though. I mean, I get by. It's just... sometimes my shoulders ache, I guess. But it's probably just from working. I don't know. Does that sound weird?
DOCTOR: Not weird at all. Shoulder aches are common with physical labor. We can certainly address that later if it becomes a problem. For now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Um... I... don't think so? I mean, I haven't been to the doctor much, ever. I remember being sick as a kid, like, colds and stuff. But not like... anything serious. I don't think. My mom... she used to take care of everything. I really don't remember. Sorry. This is hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that's alright. We'll work through it. No need to apologize. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even… tonsils? I don’t think so. I really don't remember ever being in a hospital. Just... regular sick days, with my mom. I think. It's all a bit fuzzy. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's not a bother, Emileigh, but it's rather difficult to get a proper medical history when you don’t recall much. Let’s try family history then. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, grandparents, siblings – have had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um... My mom... she had... problems with her heart, I think. But she... she passed away a long time ago. I don't remember much about it. And I don't really have any siblings. My grandparents... I never met them. They lived far away. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more. It's just… all very blurry. Is this... making things harder?
DOCTOR: It is making things rather difficult, to be frank. Alright. Let's move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat... pretty much anything. And I haven't taken much medicine, ever. Except... maybe when I was a kid? I don't remember. I really don't. Does that mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t mean something is wrong, Emileigh. It simply means we have very little to work with. Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not even… vitamins? I don't take anything. I just... work. I don't really think about that stuff, I guess. I’m sorry. I feel like I'm not being helpful. This is just… hard for me to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, in that case, let’s do a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure for a new patient, and it might jog your memory. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it going to hurt? I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt. It’s just a blood pressure cuff and a quick pulse check. No needles yet. We’ll save those for bloodwork if necessary. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Ears and nose look normal, throat is clear. Everything seems normal on initial examination, although you do appear a bit… tense.
PATIENT: Oh. That's... good? I just... get nervous at the doctor, I think. And I’ve been working a lot. Lifting heavy things. I don’t really know what ‘tense’ means, though. Does that mean something is wrong? Is it my shoulders? They ache sometimes, like I said.
DOCTOR: ‘Tense’ simply means your muscles are tight. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. It’s likely related to the physical labor you do. We can discuss some exercises or stretches if it continues to bother you. Given your limited medical history, and the normal findings on this initial examination, I recommend we order some basic bloodwork to get a baseline. It will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It's just a precaution. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Okay. Bloodwork... that means needles, right? Um... I guess so. If you think it's important. I just... don't like them. But if it helps... yeah, okay. Bloodwork is fine. When do I need to go? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: It will involve a small needle, yes. But it’s very quick. You can go to the lab across the street anytime tomorrow. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. They'll send the results to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here’s the requisition form. Take this to the lab. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Um... No, not really. Just... the lab is across the street? It's easy to find? I don’t really know this area very well. And... will they call me if there's something wrong? I just... don’t want to forget. I always forget things.
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is directly across the street. You can’t miss it. And yes, they will contact me with the results, and I will contact you if anything is concerning. I will make a note to call you in a week to follow up. And to reiterate, if you experience any concerning symptoms – chest pain, severe headache, shortness of breath – go to the emergency room immediately, do not wait for me to call. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. Thank you... I guess. I hope it doesn't hurt too much. And I hope I don't forget anything. I'm really bad with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome. Try not to worry. Have a good day, Emileigh. And please, if anything changes, don’t hesitate to call the office.
