DOCTOR: Hi Elijiah, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey, good to meet you too, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird. I just… have a really hard time getting out of chairs, sometimes. Not every time, but often enough it’s a problem. It started a few months back, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A difficulty getting out of chairs, started a few months ago. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It’s not like I can’t get up. It’s more… a struggle. Like my legs feel really heavy, and it takes a lot of effort to push myself up. Sometimes I feel a little shaky when I do finally get going. It’s happened with all kinds of chairs – my kitchen chair, at work, even… well, even at the movies. It just seems random.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a struggle to get up, legs feel heavy, and some shakiness when you stand. And it’s happened in different types of chairs. Do you have any pain when you try to get up, or at any other time?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's not like a sharp ache or anything. More just… tiredness. Like my muscles are really worn out, even if I haven't been doing much. And like I said, the shakiness. It’s mostly in my legs, but sometimes I feel it a little in my arms too when I’m pushing off. It doesn't last long, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just heaviness and shakiness, mostly in your legs, sometimes arms, when getting up. How about this – on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being hardly noticeable and 10 being completely debilitating, how would you rate the difficulty you have getting up on a typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It really depends on the chair, honestly. Some days it's a 3 or 4, just a little bit annoying. Other days… like if it’s a really low chair, or I’ve been sitting for a while, it can get up to a 7, maybe even an 8. It’s kinda scary when it gets that bad. Makes me feel really unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates between a 3-8, depending on the chair and how long you've been sitting. And it makes you feel unsteady. Have you noticed if anything specifically triggers it, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. I think… maybe when I'm really tired? Like after a long shift at work. Definitely worse if I haven't had much water that day, I think. And… this might sound weird, but sometimes it feels worse when it’s really hot out. Like, the heat just seems to make everything harder. But I can’t say for sure if that’s just me thinking things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially worse with fatigue, dehydration, and heat. Let’s talk about your work for a second. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I work as a roustabout in oil and gas. It’s… physical labor. Lots of lifting, moving things, being on my feet all day. We mostly do site prep and maintenance, that kinda stuff. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. It’s pretty demanding, though, even on a good day. Lots of time spent outdoors, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, physically demanding work, outdoors. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms, anything at all, that seem to come along with this difficulty getting up?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling kinda thirsty a lot lately, even when I'm drinking water. And… I've been a little more clumsy than usual, I guess. Dropping things, bumping into stuff. Nothing major, but my wife – well, used to notice it. She’d always point it out. It’s been a few months now, since… since she passed. Sorry, didn’t mean to get all down. It just makes it hard to keep track of things sometimes.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry for your loss, Elijiah. It’s understandable that it would be hard to keep track of things right now. And thank you for sharing that. So, increased thirst and some clumsiness along with the difficulty getting up. Just to be thorough, have you had any muscle cramps, weakness, or changes in your skin or nails?
PATIENT: No cramps, not really. And no weakness, not that I’ve noticed. Skin… I don't know. I spend a lot of time in the sun, so it’s usually just kinda… weathered, you know? Nails are okay, I guess. I don’t really pay much attention to them. I haven’t noticed anything different, but like I said, I’m not really one to check those things. I mostly just try to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cramps, weakness, or changes in skin/nails. Now, let's go through a quick medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Never had any major health problems. Just the usual colds and flu stuff, nothing serious. My wife… she took care of all the doctor stuff when we were together. I didn’t really get involved. It’s kinda silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I’m a pretty healthy guy, usually. This whole chair thing is just… weird. It’s been getting worse lately, though. That’s why I finally decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom is still alive, she’s doing okay, I think. She lives back in Mexico. My dad passed away a long time ago. I don’t really know much about his health history, to be honest. He wasn’t around much when I was growing up. My wife’s family… they’re all pretty healthy too, as far as I know. No major heart problems or anything like that. But I don’t really have a lot of details. Sorry. I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. So, mom is alive and doing okay, father passed away, no known major health problems in either family. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, if I pull a muscle at work. But nothing serious. I've never had a reaction to anything, that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or medications. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Can you step off the exam table and we’ll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70, and your pulse is 68 and regular. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, could you stand up and I’d like to check your strength and balance?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Alright, go ahead. Feels… normal so far. Still a little heavy, but I guess that's just me. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now, can you try squatting down and standing back up a few times?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. That’s… harder than it looks. Feels kinda wobbly. And my legs are definitely burning now. It’s like they’re just… not responding right away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that was a bit difficult, and you had to use your arms to help you stand. Your reflexes seem normal, but there's some mild weakness in your legs. And your gait – the way you walk – looks a little unsteady. Given your symptoms – the difficulty getting up, the weakness, the shakiness, the increased thirst, and the lower blood pressure – I suspect you may have some degree of dehydration and possibly some electrolyte imbalance. It's also possible that you have a mild form of orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when you stand up. However, it’s important to rule out other possible causes. I want to order a few blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm also going to check your Vitamin D levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Blood tests are fine. Vitamin D… never even thought about that. Dehydration makes sense, I guess. I haven't been drinking enough water, especially with the heat. But the shakiness… and the weakness… that’s still kinda scary. So, blood tests… and then what? Will I need more tests after that?
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood tests first. Then, depending on the results, we may need to consider a neurological exam to rule out any nerve or muscle issues. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough. For now, I want you to focus on increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, especially when you’re working. Also, try to incorporate more electrolytes into your diet – things like bananas, oranges, and sports drinks can help. And please, take it easy for a few days – avoid any strenuous activity until we get the blood test results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have those results, and we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. More water, electrolytes, take it easy… I can do that. And a follow-up appointment… okay. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s been kinda worrying, this whole thing. So, where do I go to get the blood tests done? Is there a lab nearby?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I understand your concern. There's a lab just across the street, inside the medical building. I'll print you out a lab requisition form with all the necessary tests listed. You can take this to the lab, and they'll draw the blood samples. They’ll send the results directly to me, and my nurse will contact you to schedule the follow-up appointment once they’re available. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Lab across the street, they send the results to you, and someone will call me about a follow-up. Sounds good. Thanks again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. Take care, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember to stay hydrated.
