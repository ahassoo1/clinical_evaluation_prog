DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this…going to the bathroom. Or, not going, really. It’s just…difficult. Takes me a long time, and I have to strain, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with urination… and you said it’s been happening for about a month?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer, hard to say exactly. It’s not painful, exactly, just…effortful. Like there’s something blocking it, but there isn’t. Does that make sense? I used to be able to go right away, no problem at all. Now…well, now it's a project.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Kandy. It sounds frustrating. And it's good you're able to describe it like that. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, could you tell me a little more about how often you're needing to go?
PATIENT: Well, that’s funny you ask. Usually, I go…oh, three or four times a day, maybe? But lately…it feels like I go more often, but less comes out each time. Like I’m trying and trying, and it’s just a little trickle. And then I feel like I still have to go, even though I just did! It's a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frequent, small amounts… and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine…let me think. Hmm. I don't think so. It looks…normal, I suppose. The color is the usual, you know? Not cloudy, not bloody…nothing like that. Maybe a bit darker when I haven’t had enough to drink, but that’s just common sense, isn’t it? I try to drink my water.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. And it’s important that you are staying hydrated. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back…well, I get the usual aches and pains, you know, being my age. But nothing different, nothing sharp or sudden. Just the normal old lady creaks, I suppose. And no pain in my side either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any problems with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Hmm…no, not really. They're…regular enough. Maybe a little constipated sometimes, but nothing terrible. I eat enough fiber, usually. I've always had a good appetite, thank goodness. Does that matter? Is that connected to the…bathroom problem?
DOCTOR: It's good to rule things out, Kandy. Constipation can sometimes contribute to urinary issues, so it’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a touch of high blood pressure, the doctor keeps an eye on it. And my knees aren't what they used to be, so I get arthritis pain. But other than that…not much. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Oh! And I have Medicare, of course.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and arthritis. And Medicare – thank you for letting me know. Have you ever had any surgeries, Kandy?
PATIENT: Let me think…no, not any surgeries. Never had a need for them, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago, but that’s about it. Nothing major, nothing recent. I always try to avoid hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, is there a family history of any kidney problems, bladder issues, or prostate issues – on either side of your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history... That’s a tough one. My mother had…well, she had some sort of trouble with her waterworks when she got older, I remember that. But she never talked much about it, you know? My father, he was healthy as a horse. And my brothers…I don’t really know. We haven't kept in touch much since we moved away. So, I’m not really sure. Sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Kandy. It’s understandable. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see... I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they're acting up. That’s about it. Oh! And I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. But that’s just a small one, once a day.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be afraid of bees, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I eat just about everything, thankfully. My mother was a wonderful cook, and I learned to enjoy all sorts of flavors.
DOCTOR: No, a fear of bees isn't an allergy, Kandy. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a brief neurological assessment. It will also be helpful to do a simple urine test.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable. And a urine test…I suppose that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please follow me and we'll start with the urine test. After that, we can return to the examination room for the rest of the physical exam. It shouldn’t take too long. It is important that we rule out more serious possibilities.
PATIENT: Alright. Lead the way. I hope it’s nothing too serious. My knees are already giving me enough trouble these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, I’ve received the preliminary urine test results. The results indicate no infection or blood in the urine. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. Your reflexes are normal, and there are no neurological deficits. Now, I'm going to perform a gentle digital rectal exam to assess the tone of your pelvic floor muscles and to evaluate your prostate. This will give us a better understanding of the cause of your difficulty urinating. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A…digital rectal exam? Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I suppose I trust your professional opinion. I’ve never had one of those before, so I’m a little nervous, to be honest. But if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, alright. Just…be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I will be as gentle as possible. It’s a standard procedure to help understand what’s going on, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll take it slowly, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. It's important to rule out any structural abnormalities, and this will provide valuable information. Now, if you could just lie on your side with your knees bent… Let me know if you have any questions before we begin.
PATIENT: Alright. I... I think I understand. But...what are you looking for exactly? And is it common to feel…embarrassed? It’s just… a little awkward, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed, Kandy. Many patients feel the same way, and it's a very common concern. We are looking for any enlargement of the prostate gland, which can sometimes cause difficulty with urination as men age. We'll also assess the tone of the surrounding muscles and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It is a quick exam, and it will provide valuable information. I’m just going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger… Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Take a deep breath, and try to relax your muscles. It will only take a moment. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it’s not significantly firm. The surrounding muscles are normal in tone. No tenderness noted. Now, I'll just clean up and we can discuss the findings.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy. Based on the physical exam and the preliminary urine test results, it appears you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men as they age, where the prostate gland enlarges, which can cause difficulty with urination. However, it's important to remember that this is not cancer, and it is often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. We'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment with a urologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and to discuss treatment options. Do you have any questions about that?
