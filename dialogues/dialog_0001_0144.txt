DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. I was telling my neighbor, Eunice, that I hadn't been to a doctor in ages, and she said I really ought to just… check in. You know, make sure everything's still ticking. Not that I feel anything's wrong, mind you. I just figured… why not? It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. “Curiosity checkups.” Look, I appreciate you taking preventative measures, I guess, but we have a lot of patients who actually need to be seen. Still, we’ll do a quick run-through. Just to get it over with. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you worry about me taking up your time, Doctor. I'm not a complainer, never have been. Specific symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, my knees sometimes ache a bit when the weather changes, but that's just old age, isn’t it? And I get a little… winded, climbing the stairs, but I’ve always been out of shape. Nothing serious, I assure you. Honestly, I'm probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Right, knees and stairs. Okay. And…any chest pain with that shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Oh, goodness no. Not at all. Just… puffing, you know? Like a little steam engine going uphill. Not a pain, definitely not. Eunice keeps telling me I need to walk more, but honestly, who has the energy these days? Everything feels like such a chore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other issues?
PATIENT: Other issues… let me see. Oh! My hands get a little shaky sometimes, when I’m trying to thread a needle. It's been happening for… well, I can't quite remember when it started, but it's always been just a little thing. I used to be so good at embroidery, but now… it's just a bit fiddly. Nothing to bother you with, really.
DOCTOR: Shaky hands, embroidery… Okay. Do you have any family history of…anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. Or maybe it was her lungs? She was always a smoker, you see. And my father… he was a strong, silent type. Never complained about anything, so I don’t really know what ailed him, if anything did. They’re both gone now, a long time ago. It’s all a bit… hazy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… I don’t really take much. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said it was making me dizzy. I think it was… a water pill? And I had a reaction to… penicillin, I think? When I was a little girl. Made me break out in hives. But that was ages ago!
DOCTOR: Okay, hives with penicillin. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I used to get terrible headaches, back when I was working long shifts in the operating room. But those stopped when I retired. I think it was just stress, really. And… no, I don't think that's all. Everything else is just… old age creeping in, I suppose. I really don't want to take up too much of your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to be thorough. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Standing… yes, I can manage that. Though my balance isn't what it used to be. Be careful, dear. I don't want to fall and cause a fuss.
DOCTOR: Pulse is… elevated. Lungs are clear, but a little… diminished. Blood pressure's okay, surprisingly. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Yes, there's a tremor there. And your reflexes… a little sluggish. Overall… it’s what I expected. Now, sit back down. I'll need to enter some information into the computer.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound very good, does it? Elevated pulse… diminished lungs… It’s probably just the stress of being here, honestly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, I can’t even remember how long. You’re not going to send me to the hospital, are you? I really don't want to be stuck in one of those places.
DOCTOR: No, no hospital. Look, Ms. Calvery, you're… generally healthy for your age. The tremor is likely benign, and the diminished lung sounds could be from a number of things. I'm going to recommend… a low-sodium diet, some light exercise if you're able, and maybe a multivitamin. And… come back in six months for a follow-up. Here’s a printout with some basic information. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. A multivitamin… and light exercise. Eunice has been telling me that for years. That’s… good. I suppose. I really don’t want to bother you with anything else. I’m just glad I came, just to… check in. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, you’ve had your “curiosity checkup.” If anything changes, or you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, call the office immediately. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery. .
PATIENT: Alright, yes. I will. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll try to remember all that… diet, exercise… and call if anything changes. Though what “anything” is… well, never mind. .
