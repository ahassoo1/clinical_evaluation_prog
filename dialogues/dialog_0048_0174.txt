DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s… difficult to explain. I just haven’t been myself lately. Everything feels heavy, you know? I suppose that’s why I’m here. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. I haven’t much time, so if we could be efficient, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," alright. Vague symptoms are… less than helpful, but we'll try. By "heavy," do you mean physically, emotionally, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Mostly emotional, I think. Though, I have been rather tired, come to think of it. But it’s not like a… a physical tiredness. It’s just… a weariness in my soul, perhaps? Does that make any sense? I really don’t know the proper words. It’s been going on for… oh, a few months now, at least.
DOCTOR: A weariness in your soul… right. And has anything specific happened in the last few months that might be contributing to this… weariness?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Well, my grandson, David… he moved to Canada for work. A very good opportunity, of course, but I miss him terribly. We were very close. And… my divorce was finalized last year. It wasn't a happy affair, and the paperwork just kept reminding me of… everything. But truthfully, I don't know if those are it. It just feels… constant.
DOCTOR: Divorce finalized last year, grandson moved to Canada… alright. And you say this feeling is constant?
PATIENT: Yes, constant. It doesn't come and go, not really. Some days are… worse than others, certainly. But it’s always there, a sort of… grey cloud hanging over everything. It makes it hard to enjoy things, you know? Even things I used to love. Gardening, for example. I haven’t touched my roses in weeks. And I’m a lifeguard, Doctor! I should be energetic, positive... it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: A lifeguard?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, I do a bit of everything, really. Lifeguarding in the summer, ski patrol in the winter. Keeps me active, usually. Or used to. It’s… it’s harder now, focusing. I worry I’m not as sharp as I need to be. That’s… concerning, naturally. I've been doing it for decades. A long time to feel… this way.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat very little, other days I find myself snacking constantly, but not out of hunger. Just… to fill a void, I suppose. And sleep? It's… fitful. I wake up several times a night, thoughts racing. I used to sleep like a log. Now? It’s a struggle. I find myself getting up and just… wandering around, sometimes. It's quite unlike me.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, disrupted sleep… Alright. Do you have any family history of… let's say, emotional difficulties?
PATIENT: Emotional difficulties? Hmm. My mother… she was a very anxious woman. Always worrying. And my sister… she suffered from spells of… sadness, I suppose you could call it. Nothing formally diagnosed, mind you. Back then, you didn’t talk about such things. But yes, a bit of it on both sides. It wasn’t… a cheerful family, if I'm honest. Though, I always thought I escaped it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them, if possible. Always have. I believe in letting the body heal itself, generally. Though, clearly, that isn't working at the moment. I do take vitamins, a general multivitamin. And sometimes, if I have a bad headache, I’ll take paracetamol. But that’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying physical causes. It's standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… basic things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. I understand. Efficiency is appreciated. Let's get on with it, shall we? I do have another appointment this afternoon, you see. Though, I trust you know the drill. A quick check-up is just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical… Strength is 5/5 in all extremities… No obvious focal neurological deficits. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Everything appears within normal limits physically.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though, I told you, it’s not physical. It’s… here. It’s this… weight. So, where does that leave us, Doctor? If everything is normal, what am I to do? I haven’t much patience for endless tests and speculation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it’s possible you’re experiencing symptoms of mild depression. Loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbance, changes in appetite… these are all common indicators. However, it’s important to remember that I cannot make a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation. Given your desire for efficiency, I can offer you a referral to a psychiatrist for a more thorough assessment. They can discuss potential treatment options, including therapy or medication, if appropriate. Or, we can monitor your symptoms for a few weeks and revisit this if they worsen. Which course would you prefer?
PATIENT: A psychiatrist… Honestly, the thought of more appointments and discussions… It’s rather daunting. Could we… monitor for a few weeks? Perhaps if I just… try to occupy myself, get back into the garden, see if things improve on their own? I’m reluctant to jump into anything drastic just yet. And I'm rather hesitant about medication, as I mentioned. A few weeks seems… manageable. But if it gets worse… I'll come back, of course. I don't want it dragging on unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. We can monitor for four weeks. I’ll write a note recommending you resume your normal activities, focusing on things you enjoy. If your symptoms worsen, or do not improve within that timeframe, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience any thoughts of self-harm, seek immediate medical attention. Here’s a list of local resources, including crisis hotlines, just in case. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Four weeks, keep busy, and come back if it gets worse. I appreciate your… direct approach. It's a relief. Thank you for your time. I believe that's all I needed. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Derasmo. Have a good day.
