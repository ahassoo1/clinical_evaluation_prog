DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my husband, he thinks it's a good idea to have… one of those forms. You know, in case something… happens. He worries too much, if you ask me. It’s about what I want, should I become… incapacitated. That sort of thing. He called it an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? Honestly, I don’t keep up with these things. I just want to get it done, if it puts his mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Right. An advance directive, yes. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though often unnecessary at your age. It outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment if you are unable to communicate them yourself. Your husband is… proactive. Before we proceed, let me just clarify – are you experiencing any current health concerns that prompted this request, or is this purely a preventative measure as he suggests?
PATIENT: Preventative, entirely. I assure you, Doctor, I am in perfect health. I eat well, I exercise – I walk every morning, rain or shine. It’s my husband who has a tendency to catastrophize. He read something online, no doubt. Honestly, I find it rather insulting that you would even ask if I’m ill. But, if it makes him feel better to fill out a form stating I want everything done to keep me alive, then so be it. Just… let’s not waste too much of my time, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand your… frustrations, Ms. Chilla. It's simply standard procedure to ascertain the full context. However, if you are adamant that this is solely to allay your husband’s anxieties, we can proceed directly to the documentation. Before we do that, just to be absolutely clear, when you say “everything done,” do you have any specific wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments – mechanical ventilation, for example?
PATIENT: Mechanical… what now? Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea what that entails. I just mean… do everything possible. If my heart stops, restart it. If I can’t breathe, help me breathe. It's common sense, isn't it? I don't want to be left to… fade away. My husband always says I'm a fighter, and I intend to keep fighting, no matter what. I expect you to do everything in your power to make that happen. Honestly, these questions are rather… morbid.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “everything” can be…open to interpretation, Ms. Chilla. Mechanical ventilation is a machine that assists with breathing, often used in cases of severe respiratory failure. It's a rather…aggressive intervention. To ensure your wishes are accurately documented, we need to be precise. Would you be comfortable with the use of mechanical ventilation should you be unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, are you questioning my intelligence? Of course I’m comfortable with it! If I can’t breathe, I’d be dead without it, wouldn’t I? It’s a machine that helps me. Why are we having this conversation? It’s perfectly obvious what I want. Just write down that I want all life-sustaining measures taken, and let’s be done with this. My husband is waiting in the car, and I have errands to run. I really don’t have time for semantics. It’s… frankly, a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I am documenting your wishes for full life-sustaining treatment, including mechanical ventilation. However, I must advise you that these interventions can sometimes prolong suffering without necessarily improving quality of life. It is important to consider all aspects. Before we finalize this, do you have any preferences regarding resuscitation?
PATIENT: Resus… what? Doctor, you are deliberately trying to confuse me! Look, if my heart stops, you restart it. That is what doctors do, isn't it? I don’t understand why you keep asking these… ridiculous questions. Is this some sort of test? My husband said you were a good doctor, but frankly, I am starting to doubt that. I want everything done to keep me alive. Is that clear enough? Write it down and let’s finish. I have a luncheon with my friends later, and I’m already running late. Honestly, this is an awful waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, perfectly clear. I am documenting your wishes for full resuscitation, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, should your heart stop. However, I must again emphasize that these interventions can be… physically traumatic. Now, to complete the Advance Directive, we need to designate a healthcare proxy – someone who will make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Is your husband willing to serve in that capacity?
PATIENT: Of course my husband is willing! Who else would it be? He worries too much, yes, but he is a good man, and he knows what I want. He’s always been the sensible one. Write him down. Write his name and number, and let’s be done with this whole ordeal. I really don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. It’s a simple request: keep me alive. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I’ve had more pleasant conversations with my dentist.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have documented your husband, Mr. Chilla, as your healthcare proxy. Now, just to confirm, do you understand that he will have the authority to make medical decisions on your behalf, even if those decisions differ from your expressed wishes?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying my husband wouldn’t know what I want? He practically anticipates my thoughts! We’ve been married for twenty-five years, you know. He knows me better than I know myself. Of course, he’ll make the right decisions. He’s a very reasonable man. Honestly, this line of questioning is becoming quite offensive. Is there anything else, or can I finally leave? I have a life, you know. And my husband is probably wondering what’s taking me so long. Let’s just finish this paperwork and be done with it. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. The Advance Directive is complete. I have documented your wishes for full life-sustaining treatment, with Mr. Chilla designated as your healthcare proxy. I must reiterate that this document does not guarantee any specific outcome, and medical decisions will be made in accordance with the best available evidence and clinical judgment. Here is a copy for your records. Please review it carefully and discuss it with your husband. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No, there isn’t. I think that’s quite enough, thank you very much. I just wanted to get this done, and frankly, it was more trouble than it was worth. I’m sure my husband will be relieved. I think I’ll be going now. Thank you for… your time. Though, I must say, it was a rather… unsettling experience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a… pleasant day, Ms. Chilla. Some people… .
