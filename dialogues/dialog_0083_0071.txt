DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, it’s about… some paperwork I need filled out. A friend of mine is helping me with some things to… to get settled here properly. He said I needed to come see a doctor about vaccinations for it. Something about needing proof for immigration? I'm not entirely sure, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Skarbek. It sounds like you may need documentation of your vaccination history for immigration purposes. That’s perfectly alright, we can certainly assist you with that. To start, let’s go over what vaccinations you may have already received. Do you have any records of past vaccinations with you today?
PATIENT: Well, I… I don’t, exactly. I was raised mostly… differently. Out in the woods, you could say. We didn’t really go to doctors much. My wife, bless her heart, she kept some things written down, but… after she passed, I misplaced a lot of things. I'm afraid I don’t have anything official with me. Would a list of what I remember being given as a child be helpful? It’s not much, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. It’s common for records to be lost or unavailable. A list of what you remember is a very good starting point. We can work with that, and if needed, we can perform some blood tests to check for immunity to certain diseases. Could you tell me anything you do recall about vaccinations you might have received as a child?
PATIENT: Let me see… I remember getting something… a poke in the arm, I think. When I was little. It hurt, of course. And I think… maybe another one when I started school? Smallpox, maybe? My mother was very worried about smallpox. And… I believe I got something for… for the sickness you get from dirty water, when I was a teenager. It made me feel awful for a few days. That’s… about all I can recall, truthfully. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. That’s helpful. Smallpox vaccination is good to know, though it’s less common now as the disease has been eradicated. And the illness you're referring to was likely typhoid fever, which is spread through contaminated water. To get a clearer picture of your vaccination status, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you ever had a tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Tetanus… Now, that name… I think… I might have. When I was working on the farm, I stepped on a nail once, a long time ago. I remember going to the… to the town doctor then. He gave me a shot in my leg, I think. But I don’t know what it was for, exactly. Just that it hurt, and he said it was important. Was that… tetanus? I truly don’t recall. I was quite young then, and a little frightened, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds like it could very well have been a tetanus booster, Mr. Skarbek. It’s common to receive a booster after a puncture wound. To be certain, and to determine what vaccinations you might need, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess your overall health. Then, we can discuss potentially ordering some blood tests to check for immunity to certain diseases. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this paperwork sorted out, you understand. I don't want to cause any trouble for my friend. A quick exam sounds fine. Is it going to be… unpleasant? I haven't been to a doctor in a very long time.
DOCTOR: Not at all unpleasant, Mr. Skarbek. It will be a basic exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your general health. Nothing invasive or painful. It's just to get a baseline and help us determine what vaccinations you may need. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll try to stay still. It’s just… all this feels a bit strange, after so many years. I’m not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, Mr. Skarbek, but not drastically so. We can monitor that during future visits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for your age. Given your history and the elevated blood pressure, I recommend we check a few blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health and vaccination status. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… prudent. Whatever you recommend. Blood tests are fine. Will they be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a meeting with my friend next week, and I’d like to have this paperwork completed by then, if possible.
DOCTOR: The blood draw itself is usually quick, and most people don't find it very painful – just a brief pinch. We'll use a small needle, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the results, it typically takes 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything. We can expedite the request if needed, given your meeting next week, but that depends on the lab's availability. I will also need to get a detailed history of any allergies or medications you may be taking. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. No, I don't believe so. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had any reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. And I don't take any medications currently. Just a little bit of herbal tea sometimes, for my nerves. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Mostly chamomile, if that matters. I hope that's not a problem?
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea is perfectly fine, Mr. Skarbek. It won’t interfere with the blood tests. Okay, that’s very helpful. So, to summarize: no known allergies or medications. We’ll proceed with the blood tests, and I’ll expedite the request so we hopefully have the results before your meeting next week. We'll check for immunity to tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Just… tell me where to go for the blood draw, and I'll try not to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Skarbek. I understand it can be daunting after a long time. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very kind and will take excellent care of you. Here's a lab requisition form. Please take this to Maria, and she'll get you set up. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if any vaccinations are needed. Do you have any difficulty walking or need assistance getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you. I can walk fine. Just a little slow, perhaps. Room 203, you said? Alright. I believe I can manage. Thank you again for your help. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask Maria if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
