DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Yes, well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get… stiff, you know? In the mornings. It’s a bother. I don't really… remember when it started, exactly. Just… always feels worse when I wake up.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "Stiff joints in the mornings…" Right. And is this stiffness… all over, or is it more in specific joints?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me think. It’s mostly my hands, I think. And my knees, sometimes. Not every day, though. Some mornings I can get up and move okay, and others… oof. It takes a while. I used to do a lot of… things with my hands, I guess. But that was a long time ago. I don’t… remember exactly what things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: "Mostly hands and knees, variable… Previous hand use….” Okay. And when you say stiff, is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful… sometimes. It’s not like a sharp pain, you know? More of a… ache. A deep ache. And it makes it hard to… grip things. Like, opening jars. Or playing with the little ones at work. Not that I do a lot of lifting anymore. But still. It's just… annoying. It feels old, you know? Like I’m old. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It makes sense. An ache, difficulty with gripping… variable morning stiffness. And you mentioned work… what sort of work do you do, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh, I work at the daycare. With the kids. I’ve been doing it for… a long time, I think. After my husband… well, after he passed, I needed something to do. And I like the little ones. It keeps me busy. Mostly just… playing, reading, helping with snacks. Nothing too heavy. Though sometimes little Timmy likes to hang on me! He’s a strong one. But, like I said, not often. It's just... this ache gets in the way sometimes. I don’t want to slow anyone down.
DOCTOR: Right. Daycare… exposure to children, variable physical demands. And how long has this ache been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. I really don't remember when it started. Maybe… a few years? Or longer? It just… crept up on me, I think. I don't really pay attention to things like that, you know? It's just… always been a little bit there. Some days it’s worse, some days it's not. That's all I know. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Never have.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "Gradual onset, a few years, variable…” Alright. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don’t really… think about my joints, unless they’re hurting. Let me see… flexes hands, looking at them closely I don’t think so. Not right now, anyway. Maybe sometimes, after a busy day? But I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s hard to tell. They’re a little… bumpy, maybe? But I always thought that was just… how they are. I have big knuckles, you know?
DOCTOR: "Possible mild bony prominences…". Alright. And have you ever had any injuries to your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Injuries… oh dear. Let me think. That was a long time ago. I remember… falling as a little girl, maybe? Scraped my knee pretty bad. But that was… ages ago. And, um… I think I twisted my wrist once, helping my husband in the garden. But it wasn’t anything serious. Just a little ache for a bit. Nothing like this, though. No, I don’t think I’ve had any bad injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant injury history recalled… variable memory. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But not every day. Only when it gets high. The doctor gave it to me a while back. I can’t even remember the name of it. It’s a little white pill, I think. And… that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills. They make me feel funny. And I don’t want to be dependent on anything. Sorry, I'm probably not much help.
DOCTOR: "Intermittent antihypertensive… details unclear." Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, when the pollen is bad. But that's just… seasonal, you know? Nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t been to a doctor in so long, I probably should know all this stuff! Sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know. Okay. No known drug allergies. Now, I'm going to need to examine your hands and knees. Could you please sit up and let me take a look?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need. adjusts position in chair, looking a little apprehensive Please, go ahead. I hope I’m not a bother. My joints are probably just old. It’s probably nothing serious, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your hands. Just relax them for me. Palpates the MCP and PIP joints on both hands Okay, can you make a fist for me, and then spread your fingers wide?
PATIENT: Makes a fist, then slowly spreads fingers wide, wincing slightly Ooh, that’s a little stiff. Especially… points to the knuckles on her right hand these ones. They feel… creaky. Like old doors, you know? And… flexes and extends fingers slowly it’s a little bit sore on this side, too. points to the same area on the right hand Not bad, just… noticeable. I don't usually pay attention to it unless someone asks, like you. Is that bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: "Right hand MCP and PIP joints: Mild crepitus, slight bony prominence, tenderness to palpation. Range of motion limited secondary to discomfort." Alright. Now, let’s check your knees. Could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Slowly extends legs, wincing slightly as knees straighten Oh, that’s a little awkward. They don’t bend like they used to, you know? pauses, looking at her knees I don’t think they ever did, really. flexes and extends legs slowly, with a noticeable effort It’s a little sore on the inside of this knee. points to the right knee And… rotates foot slightly a little bit stiff when I turn it. But nothing too bad. I can walk okay. I just… don’t run anymore. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: “Right knee: Mild crepitus with flexion and extension, slight limitation in range of motion, tenderness to medial joint line. No effusion noted." Okay. And can you stand up for me, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Slowly stands up, using her hands for support. Walks a few steps slowly, with a slightly hesitant gait Oh, goodness. I feel a little wobbly. continues walking a few more steps It's just… a little bit stiff. And my balance isn’t what it used to be. stops walking, looking at the doctor with a worried expression I'm probably just being silly. It's just old age, right? Is there anything seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, please sit down. It's not silly to be concerned. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you have some osteoarthritis, likely in your hands and knees. It's a very common condition, especially as we get older. It involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, which causes pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. It's not life-threatening, but it can certainly affect your quality of life.
PATIENT: Slowly sits back down, looking relieved but still a little worried Osteo… arthritis? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is there anything I can do about it? Will I be needing… shots? Or surgery? I don’t really like doctors much, you know. And I definitely don’t want to be cut open! Is it… contagious? Will the little ones at work catch it from me? I hope not, they're too precious.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's address your concerns one at a time. First, no, osteoarthritis is not contagious. It's not an infection. It's a wear-and-tear condition. As for treatment, we'll start with the least invasive options first. Shots – corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid injections – can sometimes provide temporary relief, but they aren’t always necessary, and certainly not the first step. Surgery is rarely needed unless the pain is severe and significantly impacting your function, and we’re a long way from that at this point. We'll focus on managing your symptoms with things like over-the-counter pain relievers – acetaminophen or ibuprofen – if you’re able to tolerate them. We can also discuss some simple exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, which can help improve stability and reduce pain. And weight management, if applicable, can also make a big difference. Do you have any allergies to pain relievers?
PATIENT: Looks relieved to hear it's not contagious. Oh, that's good. That's very good. Frowns slightly. Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've taken ibuprofen before, for headaches, and I didn't have any problems. But it always makes my stomach feel a little funny. And I don't really like taking pills, as I said. But… exercises? I suppose I could try that. As long as they’re not too hard. I'm not very nimble anymore, you know. And what about the little ones at work? Should I take it easy? I don't want to hurt myself while I'm playing with them. They depend on me!
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll start with a trial of acetaminophen – Tylenol – as it’s generally gentler on the stomach. If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, we can discuss ibuprofen again, but we’ll be mindful of your stomach sensitivity. As for exercises, we’ll start very gently. Simple range-of-motion exercises, like making fists and spreading your fingers, and slow knee bends. We can get you a handout with some basic exercises to start with. And regarding the little ones at work, you can continue to play with them, but be mindful of your limits. Avoid any activities that cause significant pain. It's okay to take breaks when you need them. We want to keep you active and engaged, but we also need to protect your joints. I’m going to write you a prescription for the acetaminophen, and a referral to physical therapy. They can teach you some more tailored exercises, and help you manage your pain. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking a little less worried Yes, that sounds… good. Acetaminophen, and physical therapy. And take it easy with the little ones. I can do that. Frowns slightly But… will this get worse? Will I end up… unable to move? I've seen my mother… she had trouble getting around in her later years. I don’t want that. Looks at the doctor with a pleading expression. Is there anything else I can do? Any special creams? Or foods? I'm willing to try anything to keep my joints moving. I need to be able to play with those little ones!
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s understandable to be concerned, especially given your mother’s experience. While osteoarthritis can worsen over time, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll end up unable to move. Many people manage their symptoms effectively with lifestyle modifications, exercise, and medication. As for additional measures, there's some evidence that maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce stress on your joints. A diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods – like fruits, vegetables, and fish – may also be beneficial, but the evidence is limited. There are some topical creams available – like capsaicin cream – that can provide temporary pain relief, but they don’t work for everyone. We can also discuss glucosamine and chondroitin supplements, but the research on their effectiveness is mixed. I'm not a big believer in supplements, but some people find them helpful. The most important thing is to stay active, listen to your body, and work with your physical therapist to develop a personalized exercise plan. I want you to be able to continue playing with those little ones, and we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve that. I’ll write a note recommending a consultation with a registered dietitian as well, just to see if they have any specific recommendations for you. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking a little more hopeful Yes… that sounds… very good. Dietitian, and the supplements… I suppose it’s worth a try. And the exercise. I'll try to listen to my body. Frowns slightly. But what if… what if it gets too painful? What if I can't work anymore? I need my job, Doctor. I like being with the little ones. They make me happy. Looks at the doctor with a pleading expression. Is there anything else… anything at all… that I should know?
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s perfectly valid to be concerned about your ability to continue working. If your pain becomes unmanageable despite these measures, we can explore other options – like corticosteroid injections or, in rare cases, joint replacement surgery. But we’re a long way from that at this point. And if you find yourself unable to continue working, we can discuss options for disability benefits. But let's focus on managing your pain and keeping you active for now. One more thing: it's important to protect your joints from further injury. Avoid activities that put excessive stress on them, and use proper body mechanics when lifting or carrying things. I'm going to give you a handout with some information about osteoarthritis, including tips on pain management and joint protection. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking a little less worried but still apprehensive. Yes… a follow-up appointment. And the handout. I will try… I will try to listen to my body. Frowns slightly. But… what if I forget? I'm terrible with dates, you know. And I don't want to miss the appointment. Looks at the doctor with a pleading expression. Can someone… can someone remind me? I don't want to be alone with this. Sighs softly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Looks down at her hands, looking defeated. I hope I can still play with those little ones. Pauses, then looks up at the doctor with a hopeful expression. Will you… will you write down the date of the appointment for me? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Alright. Absolutely. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed today, including the date of your follow-up appointment. I’ve also included a reminder sticker for your calendar. And my nurse will call you a few days before your appointment to confirm. I understand your concerns, and I want you to know that you’re not alone in this. We’ll work together to manage your pain and keep you active. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Takes the papers, looking relieved. No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. You’ve been very patient with me. Looks down at the papers, then looks up at the doctor with a hopeful expression. I’ll try my best to remember everything. Pauses, then smiles weakly. And thank you for not laughing at me when I forget things. Slowly stands up, using her hands for support. I should get going now. Looks at the doctor with a grateful expression. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. It was my pleasure. Remember, take it one day at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. And don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to the best of us. Goodbye, and I’ll see you in a month. Take care.
