DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble, you see. Not a complete stop, but… difficult. It takes a while to get going, and it’s not as strong as it used to be. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A bit of difficulty with your urination – taking longer to start and not as strong a stream as it used to be, and this has been going on for a month or so. That’s helpful information. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's… embarrassing to talk about, but I’ll try. It’s not painful, thankfully. Not a sharp pain, anyway. More like… a straining feeling. And sometimes, after I do go, I feel like I haven't emptied completely. Just a little bit left, you know? It’s not a lot, but I can feel it. And I find myself going more often, especially at night. That’s the worst part, really. Waking up two, sometimes three times a night. It’s tiring.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Kandy. These things are quite common, and it's important to get them checked out. It sounds like you're experiencing some straining, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and increased frequency, particularly at night – nocturia, we call that. That's all very relevant. Just to clarify, when you say "often," about how many times a day would you estimate you're urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Normally, I used to go maybe four or five times a day, you know, regular. Now… it’s more like every two or three hours. Maybe six or seven times a day. It really varies, but it’s definitely more than it used to be. And like I said, the nighttime trips are the worst. It’s interrupting my sleep, and I feel so tired during the day. I used to sleep through the night without a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase from four or five times a day to six or seven, and the nighttime trips are significantly impacting your sleep. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in the stream itself besides it being weaker?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's a good question. It’s… it’s not a solid stream, you see? It starts and stops, kind of. Like little bursts, instead of one steady flow. And it sprays a bit, sometimes. Not a lot, but enough to have to… adjust things. It's a bit awkward, really. I haven’t had this problem before.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent stream and some spraying – that's helpful. And you said this is a new development?
PATIENT: Yes, very new. Maybe the last month or so, along with everything else. I didn't used to have to worry about adjusting things, or waiting for it to start. It just… flowed. I suppose things just change as you get older, but it's unsettling. I always took care of myself, you know? Good diet, regular exercise…
DOCTOR: You're right, things can change, but it's good you're getting it checked out. It's smart to be proactive. And it’s excellent that you’ve maintained a healthy lifestyle – that can make a big difference. Now, let's move on to some other questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully. No blood at all. I’ve checked a few times, just to be sure, but it’s always clear. That's one thing I haven’t had to worry about. Though, sometimes it smells a bit… stronger, maybe? But not consistently. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Good to hear there’s no blood in the urine. And the occasional stronger smell is noted - that can sometimes be associated with a urinary tract infection, but it's not always the case. Now, have you experienced any pain in your lower abdomen, back, or sides?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That’s good, right? Like I said, it’s not painful to go, just… difficult. And no aches or pains anywhere else. My back is a bit stiff sometimes, just from gardening, but nothing specific to my waterworks, if you understand.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Kandy – no pain in your abdomen, back, or sides. Just the stiffness from gardening, which is understandable. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was no trouble. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I take a small dose every day. Other than that… not much. I haven’t had any serious illnesses. Oh! And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it’s not too bad, and I manage it with some cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, well-controlled high blood pressure, and some arthritis in the knees. That’s helpful. What medication are you taking for your high blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for about five years now, and my doctor says it's keeping things nice and steady. I make sure to take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once daily. And you haven’t had any side effects from it?
PATIENT: No, none at all. That’s one of the reasons I like it. No dizziness, no cough, nothing. Just keeps my blood pressure where it needs to be. My doctor is very happy with it. I go for regular checkups, you see, to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Kandy. Regular checkups and a medication that works well without side effects are excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, thankfully. Not to anything I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I’m not afraid of bees or anything like that, either. My mother always said I had a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any problems with their kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My father had diabetes, but I don’t think it affected his kidneys. My mother was very healthy, lived to be ninety-two, and never had any problems that I know of. And my brother… he has high cholesterol, but nothing with his bladder. I don’t think so, anyway. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant family history of kidney or bladder problems. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. How much fluid do you typically drink each day?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s an easy one. I drink a lot of water. Maybe eight glasses a day, or more, especially in the summer. I like to have a big glass with every meal, and a few in between. I used to drink tea, but the water is better for my kidneys, my doctor said. I try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Staying well-hydrated is very good. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t care for it at all. My mother always said it was bad for your health, and I listened to her. I’ve never even tried a cigarette. I prefer fresh air, and a good walk in the garden.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Kandy. No history of smoking. Okay, that gives me a really good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a gentle abdominal exam. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. And then I'll do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I understand you need to check things properly. I'm not worried, as long as it's not too painful. I've had doctors poke and prod before, so I'm used to it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t be painful, I promise. Okay, I’m not detecting any significant tenderness or masses in your abdomen. Your reflexes and sensation are normal. Everything feels within normal limits. I’m going to listen to your back as well, just to be thorough. Your lungs sound clear. Everything sounds good so far. Based on what you’ve told me and my exam, I’m thinking this could be a few different things. One possibility is an overactive bladder, which is common in women your age. Another could be some mild obstruction, or narrowing, of the urethra. It's also possible there's an underlying infection, although you don't have any other symptoms of that. To rule things out, I’d like to order a couple of tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests will help, I suppose. I’d rather know what’s going on, rather than just guessing. What kind of tests are you thinking? I hope they aren't too… invasive.
DOCTOR: No, they’re not invasive at all, Kandy. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for any infection or blood, and a post-void residual volume test, which measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. It's a simple, non-invasive test, you’ll just urinate as normal, and then a quick scan will tell us how much is left. We’ll also do a basic kidney function test, just to make sure everything is working properly. And, to get a clearer picture of the urethra, I’d like to order a urodynamic study. It involves placing a small catheter to measure the pressures in your bladder as you fill it with fluid. It's a bit more involved, but it gives us very valuable information. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot, Doctor. The catheter sounds a bit unpleasant, to be honest. Is that absolutely necessary? I'm not keen on having things… inserted. The urine analysis and the kidney test sound fine, but I'm a bit worried about the other two. Can we start with the simpler ones and see what they show? Perhaps we don't need the more invasive tests if those are normal.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Kandy, and I completely understand your hesitation. You’re right, we can definitely start with the simpler tests – the urine analysis and the kidney function test. Those will give us a good baseline. If those come back normal, we can then discuss the urodynamic study in more detail and decide if it’s truly necessary. It’s important that you feel comfortable with everything we do. We’ll order those tests today. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of water and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate the bladder. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Starting with the simpler tests is a good idea. I appreciate you listening to my concerns. And yes, I’ll definitely avoid caffeine and alcohol. I haven’t had much alcohol lately anyway. So, just to be clear, the lab will call me? And it's okay if I ask them questions about the tests?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Kandy. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. And absolutely, please feel free to ask them any questions you have about the tests. They are there to help. I’ll also be available to answer any questions you have at our follow-up appointment. I'm going to write down some notes and then give you a summary of everything we’ve discussed today, along with instructions for the tests. Here you go. This includes everything we’ve talked about, the test instructions, and my contact information should you have any questions before our next appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very helpful. I think I understand everything. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, but I’m sure I’ll think of something later. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I was a bit worried coming here, but you’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. It’s my job. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything comes up. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
