DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I’m here for what my son called a “tune-up.” He worries about me, good boy that he is. I’m… getting on in years, you see. Figured it couldn’t hurt to see how things are holdin' up, make sure nothin' major is needin' fixin'. He said somethin' about “optimization”? Sounded fancy.
DOCTOR: “Optimization,” eh?
PATIENT: Yep. He reads a lot of them articles online, always sendin' me links. Says it's about more than just fixin' what's broke, it's about keepin' everything runnin' smooth for as long as possible. Truth be told, I feel alright for my age. Still get out and do a bit of work, though it takes a little longer to recover these days. My hands… they ain't what they used to be, but I manage. I etch and engrave, you see. Been doin' it most of my life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Kammann. Etching and engraving sounds… intricate. That requires a steady hand and a good eye. So, you're generally feeling well, but your son's concern prompted you to come in for a check-up to make sure everything is running smoothly, and to perhaps identify anything before it becomes a problem?
PATIENT: That about sums it up perfectly, Doctor. Steady hand used to be the key word. Now it’s more like… a determined hand. It's just little things, mostly. Get tired easier, joints ache a bit after a long day in the workshop. Nothin’ that keeps me from workin’, mind you. But I figure it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with my family history. My pa… well, he didn’t take care of himself, and it caught up to him quick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're thinking proactively, and it's helpful to know about your family history. We’ll definitely want to discuss that a bit later. Let’s start with a more detailed look at how you’ve been feeling generally. When you say you get tired easier, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like fallin'-down tired, Doctor. More like… the energy just kinda leaks away. I used to be able to work in the workshop all day, maybe take a short break for lunch, and still have plenty left over to visit with my grandkids or help my son around the house. Now, I gotta sit down for a bit after a few hours, and even then, I mostly just… sit. Not much energy for much else. It’s been gettin’ worse gradually over the last year or so, I reckon. Not a sudden thing, just a slow fade. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it's noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual decrease in energy over the last year. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned your joints ache. Where exactly are you feeling the pain, and would you describe it as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Mostly in my hands and wrists, Doctor. It’s the hands mostly, truth be told. The wrists some, but not nearly as bad. And it’s not constant, no. It’s worse after I’ve been workin’ for a while, especially if I’m doin’ a lot of detailed work. The kinda stuff that requires a lot of small, precise movements. It’ll ache and feel kinda stiff, and sometimes a little swollen. Restin’ it usually helps, and a warm compress does wonders. It doesn't keep me from workin’, mind you, but I gotta take more breaks now. Used to be able to go all day without thinkin’ about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, aching and stiffness in your hands and wrists, worse with detailed work, relieved by rest and warm compresses. We'll want to take a closer look at your hands during the physical exam. Before we do that, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. Just the hands and wrists. My knees get a little creaky sometimes, like any old man’s, I suppose. But it ain’t pain, exactly. More like… a reminder that I’ve put some miles on ‘em. Doesn’t bother me enough to complain about, though. Been good to me, those knees. Carried me around for a long time. Honestly, I’m more worried about my hands. That’s how I make my livin’, you see. Can't do much without 'em.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll definitely focus on your hands, then. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not as far as I know, Doctor. I've been lucky, I reckon. Never had much trouble with anythin' serious. Had a bout of pneumonia when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. I go to the dentist regular, get my eyes checked, that sort of thing. But never been told I had anythin' wrong with me, nothin' that needed treatin'. My pa… he had some trouble with his heart, but I don't think I inherited that. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, some meat, not too much sugar. And I try to stay active, even if it's just workin' in the workshop. Oh, I did have my gallbladder taken out years ago, maybe twenty years now. But that hasn't bothered me none since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history other than gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and you generally feel healthy. That’s good to hear. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. My son keeps after me to take it. Says it'll keep me goin' longer. And sometimes, when my hands are really achin', I'll take a couple of ibuprofen. But not every day, no. Just when I need it. And I try not to take more than the recommended dose, I've always been careful with that sort of thing. My mother always told me, "Too much of anything is a bad thing." She was a wise woman, my mother.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had good guidance in your life. So, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And no allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with allergies, nothin' like that. Can eat just about anything, and I don't sneeze or wheeze around pollen or dust. Lucky again, I reckon. My grandkids, though… they're always snifflin' and coughin' with somethin' or another. But me? I've always been pretty sturdy. Come to think of it, I did get stung by a bee once when I was a boy, but I didn't have no reaction. Just a little pain for a while, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's excellent. Now, before we move on to your family history, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That'll involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain't afraid of a little exam. Been to plenty of doctors in my life, though mostly for check-ups. Just hope you don't find nothin' too serious wrong with these old hands. They're how I make my livin', you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 138 over 82. Not bad. A little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let's take a closer look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, and then spread your fingers as wide as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. There we go. Feels a little stiff, but I manage. It’s worse first thing in the mornin’, though. Gotta work 'em a bit to get 'em loose. You see what I mean? Not too bad, but it's noticeable. And it aches some when I do a lot of detailed work. Been gettin' worse gradually over the last year or so. I reckon it's just age catchin' up to me.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling around the knuckles of both hands, more pronounced on the right, as you mentioned. There's some tenderness to palpation on the base of the index finger on both hands. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with flexion. Do you notice any clicking or popping sounds when you move your hands?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, there is a little clickin' sometimes. Mostly in the right hand. Doesn’t hurt, just kinda… feels like somethin' shiftin' around in there. Been happenin' for a while now, gradual like. I didn't think much of it, figured it was just the joints gettin' old. There. Hear it? Not too loud, but it's there. And sometimes, after I’ve been workin' for a long time, my hands get kinda numb and tingly. Not all the time, just occasionally. Mostly in the fingertips. It’s a little uncomfortable, but it goes away after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, clicking sounds in both hands, more pronounced on the right, and occasional numbness and tingling in the fingertips, particularly after prolonged work. These symptoms, along with the swelling and tenderness, are suggestive of osteoarthritis, possibly with some involvement of the carpal tunnel. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order some X-rays of your hands to assess the joint space and look for any bony changes. I’d also like to perform a nerve conduction study to check for carpal tunnel syndrome. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays and… a nerve whatchamacallit? Sounds fancy. If you think it'll help figure out what's goin' on with these hands, then go right ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to be able to keep workin', you see. Etchin' is all I've ever known. I reckon it's worth a little discomfort if it means I can keep my hands goin'. When can we get these tests done? And will they be painful? I ain’t too fond of pain, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. The X-rays are painless, just a brief exposure to radiation. The nerve conduction study involves small electrodes being placed on your skin and a mild electrical stimulation to assess nerve function. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a mild tingling sensation, but it's generally well-tolerated. It shouldn’t take long, and it will give us more information. I can order these tests today. The scheduling department will contact you to set up appointments. We’ll also need to do some blood work to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, using a warm compress on your hands, and avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms. We can also discuss the possibility of a hand splint to provide support and reduce inflammation. Would you like to talk about that now?
PATIENT: Sounds like a plan, Doctor. I can handle a little discomfort if it means I can keep workin'. A hand splint… hmm. Never used one of them before. What does it do, exactly? And would it interfere with my etchings? That's my biggest worry, you see. Can't do much good if I can’t hold a tool properly. I'm open to tryin' it, if you think it'll help, but I'm a little hesitant. Etchin’ is a delicate art, requires a steady hand. I don’t want to mess that up.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Kammann. A hand splint is designed to provide support and immobilization to your hand and wrist, reducing inflammation and pain. There are different types of splints available. We could start with a dynamic splint, which allows for some movement while still providing support. It wouldn’t completely immobilize your hand, and it's often used for conditions like osteoarthritis. We can try one and see how it feels. If it interferes with your etching, we can adjust it or discontinue it. The goal is to help you manage your symptoms and continue doing what you love. I’m also going to prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce pain and swelling. We’ll review the side effects and potential interactions with any other medications you’re taking. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I reckon it’s worth a try, if you think it’ll help. And I appreciate you takin' my work into consideration. Etchin’ is more than just a job to me, it’s a… well, it’s a part of who I am. I'm willing to give it a shot, long as I can still hold a tool. And I'll be sure to let you know if it interferes with my work. What about these blood tests? What are you lookin' for? I don't want to worry my son unnecessarily. He's a good boy, but he worries too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The blood tests are just a routine precaution to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. We'll also check your kidney function to make sure the anti-inflammatory medication is safe for you. I’ll order the tests today, and the results should be available in a few days. I'll contact you as soon as they're back to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We'll take things one step at a time and work together to manage your symptoms and keep you doing what you love. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I reckon that covers just about everything. You've been right thorough, and I appreciate it. Just tryin' to get to the bottom of things, you see. I’m glad I came in. You've put my mind at ease, and I feel more confident that we can figure this out. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. And thank you for takin' my work into consideration. It means a lot. I guess that’s all for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammann. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results and see how you're doing. Take care, and I hope you can continue to enjoy your etching for many years to come.
