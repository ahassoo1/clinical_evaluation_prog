DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a physical. For the insurance. I need to have this done before it starts, yes? I do not know much about this country’s… systems.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A physical exam to satisfy your insurance requirements is perfectly common. We can definitely get that done for you today. I see you’re new to the country, and navigating the healthcare system can be confusing, so please don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. To start with the physical, I’ll just ask a few questions about your overall health and then we’ll do a quick exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds good. Questions are fine. I answer them. But please, do not speak too quickly. My English… it is not the best. And I do not understand many… words.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. I will speak slowly and clearly, and please, please interrupt me if I use any words you don’t understand. We can take as much time as you need. Alright. Let's begin. First, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I do not have much. In my country, we go to… the healer when we are sick. Not a… building with doctors. I was healthy, mostly. I had the fevers when I was small, like all children. And once, I broke my arm. But that was fixed. Is this what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you were generally healthy growing up, with the typical childhood illnesses and one broken arm that was treated. That’s good to know. Here, in the US, we like to have a more detailed record of things. So, just to clarify, when you say "fevers when you were small," do you recall what caused those fevers, or what the healer did to treat them?
PATIENT: No, I do not recall. It was… long ago. The healer used… plants, and prayers. I was a small boy. I just remember being hot, and tired. My mother cared for me. She made tea. That is all. This is not like… your doctors, yes? I do not have… records. It was different.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. It sounds like a very different system, and it’s completely understandable that you don’t have records. We just ask these questions to get a picture of your overall health. So, for the sake of this exam, we'll note that you had typical childhood illnesses treated with traditional remedies and recovered well. Now, let's talk about your current health. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms right now?
PATIENT: No. No pain. I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. From the travel. And… this new country is stressful. But not sick. No cough. No… stomach problems. Just… adjusting. Is that a symptom? Adjusting?
DOCTOR: Adjusting can absolutely cause fatigue and stress, Mr. Barban. It’s very common when moving to a new country. That’s not something to be concerned about right now. To be thorough, let me ask some specific questions about different parts of your body. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No. My vision is… the same. I see okay. I do not wear… glasses. Never have. Things are clear. Sometimes, at night, it is… darker. But that is just… night. Everyone sees worse at night, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And yes, you’re right, it’s normal to see a little worse at night. Okay, how about your hearing?
PATIENT: My hearing is fine. I hear… everything. My wife… she complains I hear too much. She likes quiet. I like to listen to the market, the people. I hear… everything that is happening. No problems with my ears. No ringing. Just… normal hearing.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Good hearing is very important. Alright. How about your breathing?
PATIENT: I breathe… normal. I do not have… trouble. Sometimes, when I walk up the hill, I am more… out of breath. But that is just… the hill. It is steep. I do not cough much. No… whistling when I breathe. Nothing wrong with my lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No shortness of breath or whistling sounds. Let’s move on to your heart. Have you ever been told you have a heart problem or murmur?
PATIENT: No. No one has said anything about my heart. It beats… normal. Sometimes, when I am angry, it beats faster. But that is just… anger. My mother always said I had a strong heart. She was very… wise. No doctors ever checked it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And yes, it's normal for your heart rate to increase when you're emotional. Let's talk about your stomach and digestive system. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation recently?
PATIENT: No. My stomach is… okay. I eat… normal. Sometimes, the food here is… different. But no pain. No… throwing up. No… bad problems. I go to the… bathroom, when I need to. Everything is… regular. I think. What is… constipation?
DOCTOR: Constipation means it's difficult to have a bowel movement, or you don't have one very often. It can cause discomfort. But it sounds like you don’t have that problem, which is good. Now, let’s move on to your muscles and joints. Do you have any pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: No. My joints… are okay. I work with my hands, all day. They are… strong. Sometimes, they are tired. But no pain. No… swelling. I can bend them, and move them. They are… normal. I am a strong worker. I lift heavy things. Everything is fine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright. Let's talk about your skin. Have you noticed any changes in your skin recently?
PATIENT: No. My skin is… the same. It is… brown. From the sun. I work outside. Sometimes it is dry. But I use… lotion. No… rashes. No… strange marks. Just… normal skin. I think. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good. No rashes or unusual marks. That’s excellent. Alright, Mr. Barban, we’ve covered a lot of ground with the review of systems. Now I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright. This will involve checking your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. It’s pretty standard. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… fine. I do not mind. Checking is… good. Make sure I am healthy. What is… blood pressure? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood against your artery walls. It’s important to check as high blood pressure can be a problem, but it’s very common and often manageable. We just want to see where you’re at. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then we’ll move on to blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay. I stand on the… scale. I am a tall man. I know this.
DOCTOR: Alright, you are 188 centimeters tall, and 90 kilograms. That's approximately 6 feet 2 inches and 198 pounds. That's consistent with what you've told me. Now, I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay. I relax. This is… strange. I do not like things around my arm. But I relax. My mother always said to be polite to the… healers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 130/85. Your pulse is 72. Both are within a normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Please take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths. This is… cold. Are you finding anything? Is something wrong? I feel… nervous now.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Mr. Barban. Your heart and lungs sound healthy. No murmurs or wheezing. You are doing great. It’s understandable to be nervous, and I appreciate you cooperating. We’re almost finished with the exam. I just want to quickly check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? What is… reflexes? Will this hurt? I do not like being… tapped. My mother… she would not tap me.
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt, I promise. Reflexes are just a quick way to check how your nerves are working. It’s a very simple test. I’m just going to gently tap on your knee with this hammer and see how your leg responds. It's completely normal, and many people find it a little surprising, but not painful. If you’re not comfortable, we can skip it.
PATIENT: No. No tapping. I do not want to be tapped. Skip it. Please. My mother… she always said to protect my body. It is… a gift.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. That’s perfectly fine. We can definitely skip that part of the exam. Your comfort is my priority. Alright. So, based on what you’ve told me and the exam I’ve performed, you appear to be in generally good health. Your height and weight are normal, your blood pressure and pulse are within a normal range, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is all. You say I am healthy. That is good. I need this for… the insurance. Will you… send this to them? Or do I need to… take it? This country is very confusing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it can be confusing. I will send the results directly to your insurance company electronically. You don’t need to do anything. It usually takes a few business days for them to process it. I’ll also provide you with a copy of these results for your own records. Here you go. It summarizes everything we discussed today. Do you have any other questions for me about the results, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: No. Thank you, Doctor. You were… very patient. And you did not tap me. That is good. I think… I am finished now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Barban. I’m glad I could help. And yes, no tapping! It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day, and welcome to the country. .
