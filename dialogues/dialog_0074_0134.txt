DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It's lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this stomach of mine. Been feeling poorly for a bit now. I just… don’t feel hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, it doesn’t stay with me. Makes me feel quite weak, it does. I’m not sure what’s causing it, to be honest. It's just… been happening.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds concerning, Ms. Kelder, and feeling weak is never a good sign. “Not feeling hungry much anymore” and food “not staying with me” – could you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let's see. It's hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, not like a stomach ache, really. More like… a fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. A few bites, and I feel like I’ve had a whole meal. And then… not long after, it just… comes back up. Not always, mind you, but often enough to be bothersome. I don't know if that makes any sense. It just feels…off.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. It sounds quite unpleasant. So, a feeling of fullness quickly after starting to eat, even with small portions, and then sometimes experiencing… nausea or vomiting afterward?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it! Nausea… yes, that’s a good word for it. And sometimes… well, sometimes it does come back up, like I said. Not a lot, thankfully, but enough to worry me. I've also been… well, I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to, but I haven’t really been keeping track. Everything feels so… fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Weight loss, even if unintentional, is definitely something we need to investigate. And feeling "fuzzy" – do you mean you’ve been experiencing any dizziness, or is that more of a general feeling of unwellness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… more like a feeling of just not being quite here, you know? Not dizziness, exactly. More like… my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I get… confused easily, sometimes. Little things, mostly. Forgetting what I went into a room for, or… names. It's been happening more and more lately. It started… well, I’m not sure when it started, honestly. Everything's a bit of a blur. I had a bit of… trouble with my cancer treatments a while back, and I always wondered if it was related.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for telling me that. It’s important to share all of these details, Ms. Kelder. And yes, your history of cancer treatments is very relevant. Can you tell me a little more about those treatments?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it was a few years back now. They said it was… something to do with my stomach, I think. They gave me… pills, mostly. And then some… liquids, through a little tube. It made me very sick, to be honest. Hair fell out, no energy… it was a difficult time. I had to stop the treatments early because I got so weak. I… I don’t remember exactly what kind of cancer it was, to be honest. My daughter, Sarah, she’d know. She took me to all the appointments. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That sounds very challenging, Ms. Kelder. It’s completely understandable that you wouldn't recall all the specifics after some time, especially given how difficult those treatments were. We can certainly reach out to Sarah for that information, with your permission, of course. Before we do that, let’s talk a bit more about your current situation. You mentioned losing weight. Roughly, how much weight would you say you’ve lost?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s a good idea. Sarah would probably remember better than I would. She's a good girl, that Sarah. As for the weight… hmm. That's hard to say. I used to weigh… oh, I don't know. Around 130, maybe? And now… I’d guess around 120, give or take a few pounds. It’s not a drastic change, but I can feel it. My dresses don't fit quite the same way, and I get tired easily. It’s just… worrying, you know? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kelder, and it’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes. Losing around 10 pounds can be significant, especially when combined with the other symptoms you've described. Now, let’s briefly review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… Nothing major, I don't think. My blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes, the doctor told me. But they gave me a little pill for that. Other than that… well, my joints ache sometimes, especially in the cold weather. Just old age, I suppose. And I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, but they took it out. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, for my age. Mostly just tired and… forgetful, as we’ve discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of gallbladder removal. Thank you. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I used to love my daughter's cooking, she makes a wonderful apple pie. No reactions to any pills they've given me, as far as I recall. I haven't had any trouble with that. Though sometimes, the pills make me a bit… sleepy. But that's all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Kelder. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a simple neurological assessment to check your reflexes and memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, dear. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know? And if I start to wander off mid-sentence, please just remind me where we are. I do apologize in advance if I get confused.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. I will be as gentle as possible. And please don’t worry at all about getting confused—we can take things at your own pace. First, let's start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are slightly diminished at the bases. Next, I'd like to gently examine your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, with some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I don’t feel any masses.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That all sounds… normal, I suppose. A little tenderness… well, I've had a bit of indigestion lately, so that doesn't surprise me. The indigestion seems to come and go, but it’s there more often than not. Sometimes it’s worse after I eat, and sometimes it just… happens. It’s just a bit uncomfortable, you know? Nothing too serious, I wouldn’t think. Just old age again, perhaps.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know that the tenderness seems to correlate with your indigestion. Now, I'm going to check your neurological reflexes, and then a simple memory test, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reflexes… sounds a bit scary, but go ahead. And a memory test… well, don’t expect too much. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, as we’ve established. But I’ll try my best. Just… be patient with me, dear.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished, but symmetrical. Now, let's try a simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me as soon as I’m finished. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Three words… I can try. Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead. Just… speak clearly, if you would. It’s hard to hear sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me when you're ready.
PATIENT: Apple… um… table… and… oh dear. It’s right on the tip of my tongue! It was something shiny… something you put in your pocket… oh, I can’t remember! I'm so sorry, dear. It's gone. I just can’t seem to recall the third word.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. Don't worry about it at all. It's very common for memory to be affected as we age, and your recent health concerns may be playing a role as well. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, you’re experiencing unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea, occasional vomiting, abdominal tenderness, and some memory difficulties. Your vital signs are within a reasonable range, but your heart murmur and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation. The diminished reflexes and difficulty recalling the third word are also concerning. Given these findings, I recommend a few tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a stool analysis. I also recommend an upper endoscopy to evaluate your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Would you be comfortable with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… like a lot of tests. I'm not sure I understand all those names. Endoscopy… is that… a camera? I don't like cameras very much. And blood tests… well, I always feel a bit faint after blood tests. I’m not sure I can handle all of that. Could we… could we maybe start with just the blood tests? And see how I feel? I don’t want to be a bother, dear. It's just… it sounds a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder. It does sound like a lot, and I want to assure you that we will take things at your own pace. You're not a bother at all—your comfort and well-being are my top priority. We can absolutely start with just the blood tests – the CBC, CMP, and TSH – and see how you feel. These will give us a good starting point and can help rule out some of the more common causes of your symptoms. The endoscopy is a more involved procedure, and we can discuss it in more detail later, if needed. It would allow us to directly visualize your digestive tract and identify any potential problems, but it’s not something we need to do right away. I will write the orders for the blood tests now. The lab is located just down the hall, and they will take care of everything. They are very experienced and will make you as comfortable as possible. Would you like me to arrange for Sarah to come with you to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. Yes, if you wouldn’t mind arranging for Sarah to come with me, that would be wonderful. I always feel better when she’s there. She’s so good at explaining things, and I sometimes forget what the doctors tell me. And she can remind me to take my pills. Yes, that would be a great help. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. I’ve just sent a message to Sarah, and she’s on her way. It will take her about 20 minutes to get here. In the meantime, I will print out some instructions for the blood tests, and we can review them together. I'll also provide you with a list of potential side effects and what to do if you experience any. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful. Thank you, dear. No… I don’t think so, not right now. Just… thank you for being so patient with me. It’s just… everything feels so fuzzy these days. I worry about… well, I worry about getting worse, I suppose. But you seem very kind, and I trust your judgment. Yes, just thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my job to help you, and I assure you, we will work through this together, one step at a time. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried, and I want you to know that I’m here to address all of your concerns. Let's take a deep breath and focus on getting those blood tests done first. We can discuss the results and any further steps when they come back. Here are the instructions for the blood tests. Please read them over when you have a moment, and don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I'll check on you shortly to see if Sarah has arrived. In the meantime, please make yourself comfortable. Do you need anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, dear. No, I don't think so. Just… waiting. I'm not very good at waiting. But thank you. You've been very kind. It's just… this all reminds me of… well, it reminds me of my husband, Arthur. He used to take me to the doctor all the time when he was sick. This waiting room always smelled the same. Funny the things you remember…
DOCTOR: It's funny how certain places and smells can bring back so many memories, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. He loved lilacs. This place always smells a bit like lilacs, even though there aren't any around. He always said it reminded him of our garden back home. We had a beautiful garden… roses, and sunflowers, and of course, lilacs. It feels like a lifetime ago now.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely garden, Ms. Kelder. It’s wonderful to cherish those memories. And it's perfectly okay to feel a little sad. It’s good to remember the people we love. Speaking of remembering… it looks like Sarah is here! Is that her coming through the door?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's her! Sarah, dear! Thank goodness she's here. I was starting to feel a bit lost in all of this. Yes, Sarah! Thank you, dear.
DOCTOR: It's lovely to meet you, Sarah. I'm Dr. Reisig. Your mother has been a pleasure to speak with. We've discussed a few initial tests, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Perhaps we can review those tests together, and ensure your mother feels comfortable with the next steps?
