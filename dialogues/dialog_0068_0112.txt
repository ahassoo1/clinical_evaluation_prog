DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Sham. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom so often. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t really know how long this has been going on, truthfully. A while, I think. It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… alright. And when you say frequent, could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It feels like every couple of hours, at least. Sometimes more often, especially if I’m drinking anything. It’s hard to say exactly… I don’t usually keep track of things like that. Is that… normal? To not know?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to lose track, Ms. MacVittie. Okay. And is it just frequency – needing to go often – or are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Just… the constant feeling of needing to go. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just… inconvenient. It's been affecting my work a little, I have to be honest. I work as a concierge, and… well, you need to be available. It’s difficult when you’re constantly thinking about where the nearest restroom is.
DOCTOR: Alright, so frequent urination, no pain, affecting your work… Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine, or any blood?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. I’m so sorry, Doctor. I’m not very good at… noticing these things, I suppose. I just know I’m going to the bathroom a lot. Is that… a problem? Would I know if there was blood?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie, don't apologize. Many people don't routinely examine their urine. Blood would typically make it appear pink or red, but sometimes it’s only visible under a microscope. We can certainly check. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t had a fever, no pain in my back or side… just the frequent urination. I have been feeling a little more tired lately, now that you mention it. But I thought that was just… life. I work long hours, sometimes. And I've been a bit stressed. Would stress cause something like this?
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute to urinary frequency, certainly. Let's go through some basics. Any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Um… I think my grandmother on my mother’s side had something… I’m really not sure. I wasn’t very close to her. I don’t really know much about her health issues. Is that… important, Doctor? Should I be asking my mother? I haven't spoken to her in a while.
DOCTOR: It's good to be aware of family history. Diabetes can cause increased urination. Now, any past medical problems, surgeries, or medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, and… nothing else, really. No surgeries, no ongoing health problems. And I’m not taking any medications currently. Nothing at all. Well, except for the occasional ibuprofen for headaches, but that's it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is good to know, but it's unlikely to cause this. And no allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m fairly… unremarkable, medically speaking. I really don’t understand what could be causing this. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. MacVittie, given your age and symptoms, and lack of significant medical history, we need to rule out a few possibilities. We'll start with a urine sample to check for infection and sugar levels. And, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A urine sample and an exam… Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Where should I… leave the sample?
DOCTOR: There's a bathroom just down the hall, Ms. MacVittie. We’ll provide you with a cup. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the middle, and finish. Then bring it back to me, and we can proceed with the exam. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Alright. A mid-stream sample… I think I can manage that. I’ll go do that now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It's… a relief to finally be doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. Take your time. I'll be here when you're ready.
