DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bartok is fine. I... well, I gotta get a check-up. For the… the tryouts. Yeah, that’s right. Tryouts. It's for… a team. A sports team. Don't remember much about it, to be honest. Feels important though.
DOCTOR: Okay, tryouts. That's good. A physical check-up is certainly a smart idea before starting any new activity. Just to be thorough, even if the details aren’t crystal clear, could you tell me a little bit about what kind of tryouts these are for?
PATIENT: What kind? Hmph. Well… it’s gotta be with… balls. And running. Definitely running. And… other people. A lot of yelling, I think. It's… a man's sport. Not… not like those fancy dance things. You know? It’s… rough. I used to be good at it, a long time ago. Very good. But… everything's a little blurry these days. I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, “rough” and involving a ball. That helps. Would you say it's a team sport, then?
PATIENT: Of course it’s a team sport! What else would it be? You think I’d be trying out for… for solo… what do you call it… individual… running? No. Definitely a team. A good team. Used to be the best around here, I heard. Though, like I said, my memory… it's not what it used to be. Everyone on the team, they… they sweat. A lot. And… and helmets. Some of them wear helmets. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a team sport with helmets... that's helpful. Let's see... Just to get a better picture, Mr. Bartok, have you played this sport regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm. That’s a hard word, “regularly.” I… used to. A long time ago. When I was… younger. Much younger. Before… everything. Used to play with… with the boys. Every… weekend, I think. Or maybe it was during the week. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a… a jumble. It was… good times. But that was… a different life. Don’t ask me specifics. I won’t be able to tell you much. It's like looking at an old photograph. Fuzzy around the edges.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, no need to strain yourself. Let’s try this. Do you remember anything about why you stopped playing?
PATIENT: Stopped playing… hmph. That's a… painful question, Doctor. Really. A lot of… disagreements. With… the coach. A very… stubborn man, that coach was. Always yelling. And… and things happened. Bad things. I… I don’t like to talk about it. It was a long time ago. Best to leave it in the past, really. It’s better that way. I got… divorced around that time, too. Everything just… fell apart. It's better not to dwell, you know? Less stress. Less… everything. I just… moved on.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. You don’t have to relive anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s put that aside for now. To get a better idea of your current health, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, the doctor keeps telling me my… my numbers are high. Cholesterol, I think. And… and something with the… the sugar. Not good sugar, the doctor said. I take… a little pill. Every day. Orange pill, I think. Or maybe it's yellow. Honestly, Doctor, I just let my wife handle all that. She was… very organized. Before… well, you know. I mostly just take what she told me to take. And… and my knees. They ache. A lot. Especially when it rains. Medicare covers that, thankfully. They give me… some cream. Doesn't help much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, so high cholesterol, something with your blood sugar, and knee pain. We'll definitely look into those. Do you remember the name of the pill you take for the cholesterol and sugar?
PATIENT: Name of the pill… hmph. That's… a tough one, Doctor. She kept it in a… a little bottle. With a… a childproof cap. It was… round. I think. And… and it had a… a name on it. A long name. Started with a… a letter. Maybe an “A”? Or a “B”? Honestly, Doctor, I wasn't paying much attention. I just took it with my breakfast. Every morning. She was very strict about that. She said it was… important. For my health. But the name… it escapes me. Sorry. My brain… it doesn't work like it used to.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bartok. Don’t worry about it. We can look that up later. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think… I think I got a rash once. From… from a shot. A long time ago. When I was in… the service. Maybe. Or maybe it was just… mosquito bites. I get a lot of mosquito bites. Especially around my ankles. It was… itchy. Very itchy. I put some… some cream on it. Didn't help much. I don’t remember what the shot was for, though. Or what the cream was. Honestly, Doctor, my memory… it's like a sieve. Everything just… slips through. I don’t think I’m seriously allergic to anything. I eat… all kinds of things. No problems. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible reaction to a shot in the past. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. That’s… that’s a tough one, Doctor. I think… I think I had something done on my… on my knee. The other one. Not the one that aches now. The other one. A long time ago. When I was… younger. They… they cut it open. I remember being… very sleepy. And… and a lot of bandages. And pain. A lot of pain. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember why they did it. Or what they did. It was… a blur. They gave me… some pills. To help with the pain. I just… remember being glad it was over. And then… and then I went home. It was… a long time ago. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, knee surgery, details unknown. That's okay. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's… a difficult question, Doctor. My… my wife’s family was… very large. A lot of people. I didn’t know most of them. My… my own family… my father… he… he didn’t take care of himself. He… he drank a lot. And… and smoked. He… he died young. From… from something. I don’t remember exactly what. My mother… she… she was… quiet. She… she didn’t talk much about… about her family. She… she died… a long time ago. I… I don’t remember anyone in my family having… heart disease. Or… cancer. Maybe. I… I honestly don’t know, Doctor. My memory… it’s just… a mess. A complete mess. It’s like trying to piece together… a broken vase. Everything’s… fragmented. And… and lost. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. I really do. But… I just… can’t remember. Everything’s… just… gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. That’s alright. Don’t worry about it. It sounds like it's difficult to remember. We can come back to that later if you wish. Let's talk about you. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
