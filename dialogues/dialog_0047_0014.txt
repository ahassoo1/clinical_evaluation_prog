DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco, yes, that’s me. Hmm… well, it’s about some… paperwork, I think? My wife, she handles most of this sort of thing, but she said I needed something from the doctor. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with… things? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s a bit fuzzy. Something about needing forms, she kept saying "forms, Ronnald, you need forms." Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Forms, yes. Right. Well, that’s… vague. Your wife scheduled this appointment, did she?
PATIENT: She did, yes. Bless her heart, she’s very organized. I just… go along for the ride, mostly. She said something about FMLA, or… maybe disability? I really don't recall the specifics. I’ve been… well, things have just been a little difficult lately. Not bad, just… difficult. She thought I needed some paperwork for it. Does that help at all? I feel terrible not remembering.
DOCTOR: FMLA or disability… alright. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty that might require time off work. Can you elaborate on what those difficulties are, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It's not like a broken leg or anything. More… just feeling tired. Very tired. And… a little lost, sometimes. Like I’m forgetting things, even things I shouldn’t. It’s mostly mental, I think. It makes concentrating at work… hard. I work with the church, you see. Directing activities and things. It requires focus, and… well, it’s been a struggle. My wife noticed it first, she said I was repeating myself a lot. Honestly, I barely notice it myself half the time, but then I’ll realize I’ve asked the same question three times… It’s just… unsettling. Does that make any sense? It’s not a physical pain, just… everything feels a bit off.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue and cognitive difficulties – memory issues, trouble concentrating. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It… it’s been building, I think. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? It's hard to pinpoint. At first, it was just little things. Misplacing keys, forgetting appointments. Now… it feels more constant. It's definitely gotten worse in the last three months, I'd say. That's when my wife really started pushing me to see someone. She said I wasn't myself, and… well, she's usually right. It's not like it came on suddenly, it's just… gradually gotten more noticeable. It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest. Does that help narrow it down?
DOCTOR: Alright. Gradual onset over six months, worsening in the last three. And you said fatigue and memory issues are the primary concerns. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says I’ve been a bit more… irritable, perhaps. Not angry, just… quicker to frustration. Small things bother me more easily. And… I think my sleep isn’t as good as it used to be. I wake up feeling tired, even if I’ve slept a full eight hours. And… oh! I’ve lost interest in some of my hobbies. I used to love working in the garden, but I just haven’t felt like it lately. It’s not that I can’t, I just… don’t have the energy or the motivation. It’s all a bit… draining, really. Does that sound like anything? I'm trying to recall everything she's mentioned… she does most of the remembering around here.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, irritability, changes in sleep, and loss of interest in hobbies. Past Medical History?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Oh dear. Well… I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox… nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. Other than that… I've been pretty lucky, really. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last… well, decades. I generally try to stay healthy. I eat well, try to get some exercise… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. Nothing else… I think. My wife keeps all the records, you see. I really don't keep track of these things. Would it help if she were here? She’d know all the specifics.
DOCTOR: Controlled hypertension. Alright. Any family history of… cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult one. My mother… she did get a bit… confused towards the end of her life. But it was just old age, we thought. She lived to be ninety-two, and she was very frail. She forgot things, repeated herself… but we just attributed it to being old. My father… he was healthy as a horse, right up until the day he passed. No memory issues that I recall. My sister… she’s still very sharp, thankfully. No… no, I don’t think there’s any strong family history of anything like that. At least, not that I’m aware of. It's… distant, you see. My family is mostly back in Tahiti. It's hard to keep track of everything. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. Would it help to check with my wife? She'd definitely have more information on that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to medications. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take something for the blood pressure, yes. Lisinopril, I think it’s called? And… oh, a small dose of… something for sleep, sometimes. Just when I’m really having trouble. My wife gives it to me. It’s a small, white pill. I don't really pay attention to the names, to be honest. I just take what she gives me. And… that’s it, I think. Just the blood pressure medication and the occasional sleep pill. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but I stopped taking that a long time ago. It wasn't helping much, and my wife said it was interfering with the blood pressure medication. She’s very good at keeping track of all this, you see. I really rely on her. Is there a way to check what I’m taking? I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me pull up your records… Ah, yes. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and… Trazodone 50mg as needed for sleep. Your wife is correct. Alright. Now, any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any serious allergic reactions. I can eat all sorts of foods, no problems. No allergies to medications, either. I've never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy or anything like that. Nothing at all, really. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. My wife always asks me about allergies before I take anything new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had to tell her anything. No, no allergies at all. I think I’m pretty good in that department. Is that helpful? I sometimes worry I'm forgetting something important… she's much better at these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Limtiaco, given your symptoms of fatigue, cognitive difficulties, changes in sleep and mood, and your wife’s concern, I’d like to conduct a brief physical and neurological exam. It will help us rule out other potential causes and determine if further investigation is needed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’ve not been feeling myself lately, so anything that can help figure things out is… welcome. A physical exam, you say? Yes, go ahead. I’ll just… sit here and try not to fidget too much. My wife always tells me I’m a terrible patient. I hope I’m not too much trouble. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the table for me. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we’ll move on to a basic neurological assessment. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Reflexes, you say? Yes, whatever you need. I used to be very active, you know. Played a lot of rugby in my younger days. Not much rugby these days, though. My knees aren't what they used to be. Everything seems a bit… slower now. Is that normal? I’m not sure what to expect with the reflexes… just tell me what to do. I’ll try my best. Just… try not to poke me too hard, alright? I bruise easily, my wife says.
DOCTOR: Alright. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Can you spell the word “WORLD” backwards for me, please?
PATIENT: Hmm… WORLD backwards… let me think. That’s… difficult. Is it… D-L-R-O-W? No, that doesn’t sound right. Or maybe… R-O-L-D-W? Oh dear. This isn’t easy. My mind feels a bit… foggy. I used to be very good at puzzles, you know. Crosswords, things like that. But this… this is a bit tricky. I’m sorry. It’s just… not coming to me. My wife says my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps if you gave me a moment…
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you recite the months of the year for me?
PATIENT: January… February… March… April… May… June… July… August… …September…? Oh dear. I… I seem to be stuck. I know there are more months, but they’re just… not coming to me. October…? No, that doesn't sound right. Is it November? I’m sorry, Doctor. My mind is just… blank. I used to know all the months perfectly. It’s… frustrating. This isn’t like me. I’m terribly sorry to waste your time. My wife will be very disappointed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on the brief exam and your reported symptoms, and especially the difficulties with the cognitive assessment, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If further investigation is needed, then I’m happy to cooperate. It’s… unsettling to hear you say that, about cognitive impairment. But I suppose it explains things, a little bit. The forgetfulness, the fatigue… It’s just… frightening, to be honest. A neurologist, you say? Yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Just… please keep my wife informed. She’ll want to know everything. And… is there anything I need to do? Any paperwork? Any preparation for the neurologist? I’m a bit lost, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood for the lab work before you leave today. The neurologist I’m referring you to is Dr. Eleanor Vance. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The referral form has her contact information. She’ll likely want a detailed medical history, so it would be helpful if your wife could assist with that. She may also order some imaging scans, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a better look at your brain. As for paperwork, just bring a list of all your medications and any previous medical records you may have. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m also going to recommend you avoid driving until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No driving… yes, alright. That makes sense. I haven’t been feeling very confident behind the wheel lately, to be honest. My wife has been doing most of the driving. Dr. Vance… I’ll make sure she has a detailed history, yes. My wife is very organized, she’ll handle it. Will… will this be a long process? And… is there anything wrong with me? Is it… serious? I know you can’t tell me definitively yet, but… is it something I should be very worried about? It’s just… frightening to think about. And I hate to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand your concerns, and it’s natural to be worried. I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis at this point, as we need to gather more information. The process will likely involve several appointments with the neurologist, and potentially some imaging scans. As for whether it’s something to be worried about… it’s too early to say. Cognitive impairment can have many causes, some of which are treatable, and some of which are not. We need to determine the underlying cause before we can discuss treatment options and prognosis. The best thing you can do right now is to focus on taking care of yourself, and to lean on your wife for support. I will keep you both informed every step of the way. I understand your concern about worrying your wife, and I would recommend involving her in the appointments and discussions, so she can also ask questions and get a clear understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… all for now. I suppose we just need to… wait and see. And I'll make sure my wife is involved, yes. She’ll know what to do. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for not… dismissing my concerns. It’s just… a lot to take in. I think I'll just… go and wait for the nurse now. And try not to worry too much. Although… that’s easier said than done. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Limtiaco. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
