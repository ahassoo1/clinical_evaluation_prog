DOCTOR: Good morning, Bradlee. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about getting surgery... for my weight, I think. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details, but it has something to do with... losing weight with an operation? It’s a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you’re interested in learning more about weight loss surgery. It is a big decision, and it's easy to get things mixed up. Let's start with the basics. You mentioned your wife helped set up the appointment – that’s good. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about how long you've been thinking about this?
PATIENT: Hmm... a long time, I guess. Years, probably. I've... always struggled with my weight. My wife keeps saying it’s affecting my health, and I feel tired a lot. It's just... hard. I don't know exactly when we started looking into surgery, but it feels like a while now. She did a lot of the research, to be honest. I just… agreed it might be a good idea. I don’t really keep track of dates very well.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. It sounds like this has been a long-term concern, and you’re right to want to explore all options. And it’s good you have your wife’s support. Okay, so you’ve been struggling with your weight for years, and you’re feeling tired a lot. That’s a good starting point. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. My knees hurt sometimes, especially when I walk a lot. And I get out of breath pretty easily, even just climbing the stairs. I also… I think my wife said my blood pressure was high at one point? She's always telling me to watch my salt intake. I don’t really feel sick, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And tired, like I said. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Bradlee. Knee pain, shortness of breath, and your wife mentioning high blood pressure – these are all important things to know. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve been to the doctor for checkups, but they never really said I had anything… serious. Maybe high cholesterol once? I don’t really remember. I don’t keep track of those things. My wife usually handles all the paperwork and remembers what the doctors say. I just go when she tells me to. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with this stuff.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Bradlee. It’s perfectly alright. Many patients find medical details overwhelming, and it’s good you have your wife’s support. Okay, so no known diagnosed conditions, potentially high cholesterol, but nothing concrete. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all that. Just… regular checkups, that’s it. I don't like hospitals, to be honest. That’s one of the reasons I put off talking to the doctor for so long. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Hospitals can be intimidating. No surgeries, that's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad had… heart problems, I think. He had to watch his diet a lot. And my mom… she had diabetes. She was always taking pills. I think that's it? My wife knows more about our family history. She actually made a whole chart of it once. I’ll have to ask her. I remember it being a long list though. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father, diabetes in your mother. That's good to know, and it's helpful that your wife keeps such thorough records. Now, just to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work in retail, so I’m on my feet a lot. But it's mostly walking around the store, not really… exercise. I eat… probably too much. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but it's hard. I like my food. And I don’t really have time to cook much, so we end up eating out a lot. I don't drink or smoke. That’s about it, I guess. Pretty boring. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Bradlee. It gives me a good sense of your daily routine. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not at all and 10 being extremely, how would you rate your current energy levels?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. Probably a 4, maybe a 5 on a good day. I’m always tired. Like I said, my wife keeps saying it’s affecting my health, and honestly, I think she’s right. It’s just… hard to get motivated to do anything when you’re always feeling exhausted. It feels like a weight, you know? Not just my actual weight, but… everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life significantly. Now, before we discuss the possibility of surgery, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, okay? I get a little nervous with medical stuff. And, uh, is my wife allowed to stay with me during the exam? She always helps me calm down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bradlee. Your wife is more than welcome to stay with you. And I will certainly do my best to be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. We'll also do a basic abdominal exam and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. As long as she can stay with me. She’s really good at… keeping me from panicking. I don't really like people touching me, but I guess it's necessary. Just… let me know what you're doing before you touch me, okay? That would help a lot. Is it cold in here? I think I'm getting a little chilly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bradlee. I will explain everything step-by-step before I do it, and your wife can stay right here with you. And yes, it can be a little chilly in here; let me adjust the thermostat. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll just listen with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… tell me what you're doing, like you said. I don't like surprises. It makes me jumpy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. I’ll explain everything as I go. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It doesn't hurt at all, it just helps me hear how things are working. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. We'll need to investigate that further. Your lungs sound clear, but there is some slight wheezing. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 80 beats per minute, which is normal.
PATIENT: Okay… slightly elevated… what does that mean? Is that bad? I don’t really understand all the numbers. And the murmur… what’s a murmur? Is something wrong with my heart? I’m starting to get nervous again. My wife, are you listening? What did she say about murmurs? I think she mentioned something about them before. This is too much. I just wanted to lose weight. I didn’t want to find out about all these other things.
DOCTOR: Bradlee, it’s alright. Take a deep breath. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear things you don’t understand. Slightly elevated blood pressure means it’s a little higher than ideal, but it's not an immediate emergency. We can discuss ways to manage that. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. We'll need to do an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to get a clearer picture. Your wife is right here, and she can certainly share her knowledge with you. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, let's finish the physical exam. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… echocardiogram… that sounds scary. She’s better at understanding this stuff. What did the doctor say about the echocardiogram, honey? Is it painful? I don’t like hospitals, remember? And… my stomach hurts a little, now. I think I'm getting a headache. Just… be quick, please. I really don't want to be here any longer than I have to be. This is too much information. I just want to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Bradlee, it's alright. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive procedure, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or incisions. It’s just like an ultrasound, and it doesn’t hurt at all. We can schedule it at a comfortable pace, and your wife can be with you every step of the way. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some slight tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Bradlee. I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on my findings, you have slightly elevated blood pressure, a heart murmur, and some tenderness in your lower right abdomen. Your reflexes are normal, and your lungs are clear. We need to investigate the heart murmur and the abdominal tenderness further. Would you be willing to get an echocardiogram and some blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… echocardiogram… it’s just… a lot. I don’t know… I’m not sure I can handle all this. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… skip those things and go straight to the weight loss surgery? I just want to be healthy, you know? I'm tired of feeling this way. I’m scared of hospitals and all these tests. My wife, what do you think? Should I get those tests? I trust your judgment. I really don't want to do anything that isn't absolutely necessary. This is too much stress. I just want to lose weight and feel better. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything else that’s going to scare me?
DOCTOR: Bradlee, it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and scared. We will not do anything you are not comfortable with. However, the heart murmur and abdominal tenderness are important findings that need to be investigated before we can proceed with weight loss surgery. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could affect your safety during and after the surgery. Think of it this way: these tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health, so we can make the best possible decisions for your well-being. I understand you’re nervous about hospitals and tests. We can schedule everything at a comfortable pace, and your wife can be with you every step of the way. We can also discuss options for managing your anxiety, such as medication or therapy. To be clear, we’re not pushing you into anything. We’re simply recommending these tests to ensure your safety. What are your biggest concerns about getting the echocardiogram and blood work?
PATIENT: I guess… I’m just scared of what they might find. What if it’s something serious? What if I need more surgery? I just want to lose weight, not… have a whole bunch of other problems. And… I don’t like needles. I faint sometimes when I get blood drawn. And the echocardiogram… what if it’s uncomfortable? What if they find something wrong with my heart? I just… I don’t want to know if something is seriously wrong with me. Maybe I should just… forget about the surgery. Maybe I’m not healthy enough for it. I just want to be healthy, but… this is too much. This is way too much. I'm starting to get a headache again. Is there anything else I need to know about those tests? Anything else that’s going to scare me?
DOCTOR: Bradlee, it's okay to be scared. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the unknown. And you are right to ask questions and express your concerns. Let’s address those one by one. First, about finding something serious… it’s possible, but it’s also possible that everything will be perfectly normal. These tests are simply to give us more information, so we can make the best possible decisions for your health. As for the blood draw, we can take precautions to prevent you from fainting. You can lie down during the procedure, and we can have a nurse monitor you closely. We can also use a smaller needle and a topical anesthetic to minimize discomfort. And about the echocardiogram, it’s a non-invasive procedure that doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. It’s just like an ultrasound, and it’s not uncomfortable. It doesn’t involve any radiation or electricity. I understand you’re overwhelmed, and you’re considering forgetting about the surgery. However, I believe it’s important to investigate these findings before making any decisions. We will not proceed with the surgery until we have a clear understanding of your overall health. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explain them again, please. Just… explain everything. In simple terms. No medical jargon. I want to know exactly what they’re going to do, and what they’re looking for. What does it mean if they do find something wrong? What are the options if something is wrong? And… can I bring my wife with me to all the tests? She helps me stay calm. I just… I need to know everything before I agree to anything. This is too important to rush. What if I don't want to do the tests? Can I just… go home and think about it? I need to talk to my wife about it first. This is way too much information. Can we schedule a follow-up appointment so I can ask more questions? I just need time to process everything. This is scary. I'm starting to feel faint. Honey, are you still there?
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. We will take all the time you need. And yes, your wife is absolutely welcome to be with you at all the tests and appointments. Let’s start with the echocardiogram. It’s an ultrasound of your heart. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and use a handheld device to create images of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it takes about 30-60 minutes. We’re looking for any abnormalities in the size, shape, and function of your heart. If we find anything concerning, we may need to do further testing, such as a cardiac MRI or a stress test. Now, let’s talk about the blood work. We’ll take a small sample of your blood and send it to the lab for analysis. We’re looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or underlying medical conditions. We’ll also check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. If we find anything concerning, we may need to do further testing or refer you to a specialist. You absolutely have the right to decline any testing you’re not comfortable with. However, I strongly recommend that we investigate these findings before making any decisions about the surgery. I am happy to schedule a follow-up appointment so you can ask more questions and discuss your options with your wife. We can also review your medical history and discuss the risks and benefits of surgery in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. A follow-up appointment would be good. I need to talk to my wife about everything, and I need more time to think about it. Can we schedule it for next week? Maybe… Tuesday afternoon? And… can you give me some written information about the tests? Just so I can review it at home. And… what if I decide I don’t want to do the surgery? Will that be okay? I just… I’m really scared. I don’t want to make the wrong decision. This is too much. I just want to be healthy, but… this is overwhelming. Can we please schedule that appointment for Tuesday afternoon? And… can you write down your number, just in case I have any questions before then? Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. We’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for Tuesday afternoon. I’ll have my nurse print out some information about the echocardiogram and blood work for you to review at home. And yes, if you decide you don’t want to do the surgery, that is perfectly okay. We will respect your decision. Here’s my number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. We’ve covered a lot today, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Take your time, talk to your wife, and make the decision that’s best for you. I am here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
