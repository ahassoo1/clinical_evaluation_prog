DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, good to see you. Though, honestly, at your age… you should be keeping better track of things. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it's just... I been drinkin' a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Increased thirst and hunger… right. And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me see... it start maybe... a month ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn't so bad at first, just a little extra drink here and there. But now... now I feel like I could drink a whole bucket! And the hunger... always there. Even at night. It's keepin' me up.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Okay. Have you noticed any… changes in your bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Oh, um… well, yes. I been goin' more often. More times in the day, and… well, a lot more water with it, if you understand what I mean. It's not… firm, like it used to be. Sorry to be so… plain.
DOCTOR: It's alright. These things happen. Increased frequency and… loose stools. Alright. And have you lost any weight recently, Bianca?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. My clothes feel the same. Maybe… a little heavier, even, with all the eatin'. But I haven't stepped on a scale in a while, to be honest. My husband usually does that, and he hasn't mentioned anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… well, anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, God rest her soul, she had the sugars. Not like this, but she needed medicine for it. And my brother, he have high blood pressure. But nobody ever complain about bein' this thirsty and hungry all the time. That I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any pills, thank goodness. Never had to. And I ain't allergic to nothin', not that I know of. I eat everything, praise God! Except maybe too much pepper, my husband complains about that. But that ain't a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, no allergies. Alright, well, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Where is the scale?
DOCTOR: Right over there. I’ll be right back to take your blood pressure while you’re at it. Don’t worry, it’s just a precaution.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. It's a little cold this morning, you know. Makes my bones ache.
DOCTOR: 78 kilograms... And your blood pressure is 145 over 90. A little elevated. Now, if you don’t mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think best. I'm just hopin' it ain't nothin' too serious. My husband would worry somethin' awful. He's a good man, but… he's not good with sickness.
DOCTOR: Breathing is a little wheezy, but nothing too alarming. And your heart sounds… regular, but a bit fast. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back and relax. I'll just press gently. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. You just tell me what you want me to do. It feels a little strange, lyin' flat like this. My back always aches a little… but I don't think that's what you mean, is it? Just tell me if it's somethin' I should be worryin' about.
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness… but I do feel a slight fullness. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, I suspect you may have early-stage type 2 diabetes. Your increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, and weight… or lack of significant weight loss... all point to it. The elevated blood pressure doesn't help either. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests. We'll check your blood sugar levels, A1C, and kidney function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, Lord. My mother... she had that. But... I feel fine, mostly. Just thirsty and hungry. And a little tired, maybe. Blood tests, you say? What does that mean? Will it hurt? And... what if it is diabetes? What do I do then? Is it… serious? I don't understand all of this, Doctor. Can you explain it to me, please? Slowly?
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, let's take it one step at a time. Diabetes means your body isn’t using sugar properly. It builds up in your blood, causing those symptoms you're experiencing. The blood test is just a little prick on your finger, nothing major. It won't hurt much, I assure you. As for what happens if it is diabetes… it's manageable, okay?
PATIENT: Manageable? What does that mean, exactly? Will I need… shots? Pills? My mother, she had to take pills every day. And she still felt sick sometimes. And what about the food? I love my food, Doctor. Will I have to stop eatin' everything I like? This is all very frightenning, you know. I just want to feel normal again. Is there anything I can do now? Before the tests?
DOCTOR: Look, Bianca, it’s not a death sentence. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. Yes, you may need medication – pills, possibly injections down the line, depending on the test results. And yes, you'll need to make some dietary changes. Less sugar, more vegetables, smaller portions. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, try to drink more water than usual – but not excessively, okay?
PATIENT: More water… but not too much. It's just… everything seems so complicated, Doctor. I'm an old woman, I don't understand all these things. And what about the tests? When will I get the results? And what if… what if it's really bad? My husband... he won't know what to do. Will you explain everything to me when I come back? Please? I don't want to be alone with this.
DOCTOR: Look, the lab work should be back in a few days. When you come back, we’ll discuss the results and create a plan. I have other patients waiting, so I can't spend all day on this. The nurse will give you a requisition form for the lab and instructions on where to go. Try not to worry too much before you have the results, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. The requisition form... and the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I’m ready to go now. I just hope everything will be alright.
