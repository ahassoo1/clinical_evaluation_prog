DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, you said? Yes, yes… It’s something about a check-up, isn’t it? For… work. I do a bit of ushering, ticket taking… at the theater. Something about needing to be cleared. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. They just sent me over. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. A work clearance check-up is a good start. It sounds like your employer requested this to ensure you’re able to safely perform your duties. And don’t worry about the memory – it happens. We’ll take our time. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about why they requested this check-up now?
PATIENT: Now… that’s a good question. Honestly, I couldn't tell you. Everything feels a bit… sudden. I’ve been doing this work for years, and nobody’s ever asked for anything like this before. Maybe someone new is in charge? Or a new rule? I really have no idea. I just got a letter… and here I am. Sorry I'm not much help. It's all a bit of a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Krahn. These things happen. It’s good you came in regardless. Let’s not worry about the “why” right now. We’ll focus on getting a good picture of your overall health. So, let’s start with you. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Generally… yes, I suppose. No major complaints. A bit tired, maybe? But who isn’t at my age? And my knees ache a little, getting up and down… but that's just getting old, isn't it? Nothing I can't manage. I still get to work every day. I try to stay active, walk a bit… but, really, I haven't been sick sick. Just the usual old man things, I guess. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Krahn. Thank you. It's good you’re staying active. The tiredness and knee aches are good things to mention. We’ll definitely look into those. Now, when you say “tiredness,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like… falling asleep tired. More… just drained. Like I don’t have much energy. It takes a lot to get going in the mornings. And it doesn't really get much better throughout the day. Even after a good night's sleep, I still feel… sluggish. It’s hard to explain. Like trying to push through mud, a little bit. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. “Sluggish” and “pushing through mud” – I understand. That’s a good way to describe it. It’s good you’re able to articulate that. And aside from the tiredness and knee aches, have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Let me think… Honestly, no, not really. My eyesight's getting worse, of course. But that's been happening for years. I’ve got glasses, as you can see. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Just for a moment. Nothing serious. I just need to steady myself. It doesn’t happen often. I haven’t fallen or anything. It’s just a little… wobbly feeling. That's about it, I think. Sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Krahn. It's good you're telling me everything, even the little things. The occasional dizziness is worth mentioning. It’s good to know. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tough one. Let me think… I had a bit of a scare with my heart years ago, back in… oh, I don't know, the nineties maybe? They said it was nothing serious, just a little irregularity. They gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after a few years. I haven’t been back to the doctor about it since. As for the rest… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I ate a lot of rice, you know. Good for you, they say. I’m not sure about diabetes or high blood pressure… I never really asked. They didn't tell me about anything like that. It was a long time ago. Honestly, my memory is just… not what it used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. Don’t worry about it. We can try to piece things together. The heart irregularity is good to know, and we'll make a note to look into that further. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. When I was a boy, back in China, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long, long time ago. And... I broke my arm once, when I was playing. Just a simple break, nothing too serious. I was a bit of a clumsy child. Other than that... no, I don't think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. I've never had to spend much time in the hospital. I prefer to stay away from those places if I can. They don’t smell very nice, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. We’ll document those. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one. My family… they mostly lived in China. I haven’t seen them in many years. My mother… she lived to a good age, but she had some trouble with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? My father… he died young, of a heart attack, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about his health before that. My siblings… well, I’ve lost touch with most of them. We didn’t talk about these things much, you know? It wasn’t really the custom. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… a lot of this is a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. You’ve told me what you remember, and that’s perfectly fine. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. It's a terrible habit. My wife… she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. She always said it was bad for your health. I always agreed with her. I prefer fresh air, you know? It’s much better for you.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Krahn. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. Nothing more. I don’t really care for it much, to be honest. It makes me feel a bit… fuzzy. My wife used to enjoy a glass of sherry now and then, but she didn't drink much either. We weren't big drinkers, never have been. It’s not something we really got into.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. I used to take something for my knees, a few years ago, but it didn’t seem to help much, so I stopped taking it. I sometimes take a little something for my indigestion, but that's it. Just something I get from the drugstore. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. And… no, I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, you know? Good rice, lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to any medication. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings, but I'm not allergic to anything myself. I haven't had any problems with allergies, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, that’s a lot of helpful information. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, even when it was difficult to remember. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. It’s just… a bit tiring, all these questions. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to check, just let me know. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. It won’t take long. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Finally, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Okay, Mr. Krahn, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but there are a few things I'd like to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh… good. Is everything alright, Doctor? You said “a few things”? That doesn’t sound very good. Is my heart okay? I'm a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Krahn. Don't worry just yet. “A few things” just means we need to do a little more investigating to get a clearer picture. The murmur I heard in your heart isn’t necessarily serious, but it’s worth looking into. And your blood pressure is a bit elevated, so we'll want to monitor that as well. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order a few blood tests – just a routine check of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I’d also like to order an EKG – that’s a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. And finally, I think it would be helpful to get a chest X-ray, just to take a look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Tests… more tests. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose so. I just… I don't like going to the hospital. All those machines and… people. But if it will help, then yes. Do what you think is best. But can you explain what these tests will actually do? And how long will they take? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I understand your concerns. Let me explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood tests are very simple. We’ll just take a small sample of blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and it might feel like a tiny pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The results will give us a good overview of your overall health. The EKG is also non-invasive. We’ll attach a few small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs, and they’ll measure the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it only takes about 10-15 minutes. The chest X-ray will involve a brief exposure to a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits outweigh the risks. You’ll just stand in front of a machine, and it will take a picture of your lungs. All of these tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. The lab work will take a few days, and the X-ray results should be available within 24 hours. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little, yes. A little better. Still not looking forward to it, but… if it’s necessary. And you say it won't be painful? Really? That's good. Okay. Then… yes. Let’s do the tests. But can you tell me… what are you looking for, exactly? What could be wrong? I don't want to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious. I want to be as transparent as possible. The blood tests will help us check for things like high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and kidney problems. These are all common conditions, and early detection is key. The murmur I heard in your heart could be nothing serious – it could just be a normal heart sound. But it’s worth investigating to rule out any potential problems, such as valve problems or heart disease. The EKG will help us assess your heart rhythm and identify any abnormalities. The chest X-ray will help us evaluate your lungs and rule out any signs of infection or other problems. I want to emphasize that I’m not trying to scare you. These tests are just a precaution, and the vast majority of the time, everything turns out to be perfectly normal. But it’s always better to be safe than sorry, and early detection can make a big difference in managing any potential health issues. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I suppose so. A precaution. That sounds better than… something serious. Okay. Then let’s get it over with. Where do I go for these tests? And do I need to… prepare in any way? Fasting, or anything like that? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we’ve discussed everything. For the blood tests and the EKG, you can go to the lab at County General Hospital. Here’s a referral. You do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. For the chest X-ray, you can schedule an appointment at the radiology department at the same hospital. You don't need to fast for that one. Here’s a number for the hospital if you have any questions or need to reschedule. Once you’ve had the tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. How does next week look for you?
PATIENT: Next week… hmm. Let me think. I have my theater commitments, you know. But… Tuesday afternoon might work. Yes, Tuesday afternoon would be best. Tuesday afternoon. That gives me time to get everything done. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I suppose that's all for now then? I just want to get this over with and get back to my life, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand completely. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Yes, that’s all for now. Just schedule the tests, and we’ll see you next Tuesday afternoon. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And try not to worry too much, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll try. Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski.
DOCTOR: You have a good day, Mr. Krahn.
