DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pitmon, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… short of breath. Gets worse, you know? And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too. Dry. Just… dry. Don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old age, probably,” right. Well, we’ll see about that. Short of breath… and dryness. Is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… walk. Or try to. Don’t get out much anymore, not with… everything. Used to be a traffic man, you know? Standing all day. Not so good now. Gets me winded quick. And then the dry… ugh. Like cotton.
DOCTOR: A traffic man, impressive. So, the breathlessness is brought on by exertion – walking, specifically. And it's accompanied by dryness in your mouth and eyes. Has anything – any new medications, changes in your diet, or anything like that – coincided with the start of these symptoms?
PATIENT: New… medications? Let me think. Old Man Hemmings next door gave me somethin' for my… aches. Little white pill. Can’t recall the name. Said it was good. Don't eat much different now than I used to. Just… smaller portions. Everything tastes like dust anyway.
DOCTOR: A pill from your neighbor… Alright. We’ll need to figure out what that pill is. Do you still have the pill, or the bottle it came in?
PATIENT: Bottle? No. Hemmings probably got another one. He's always givin' things away. Can’t say I remember what it looked like, either. Little, white… roundish, I think? Everything's a blur these days. Honestly, doc, I just want to be able to breathe normal again.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can't exactly work with “roundish, little, white” now, can we?
PATIENT: Don't get smart with me, young man. I'm tellin' you what I remember! It wasn’t like I wrote it down. Old folks forget things. You’d think a doctor would understand that. Now, are you gonna help me or just… judge me?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m simply trying to gather information. And honestly, relying on vague recollections isn't exactly helpful. Now, let's move on. Besides the shortness of breath and dryness, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little. My shoes have been feelin' a bit tight. But I figured it was just my feet gettin’ bigger with age. Everything swells eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Of course. Right. And what about your heart?
PATIENT: My… heart? What about it? It's beatin', I reckon. Still goin' strong… mostly. Sometimes it skips a beat, or feels like it's flutterin' around. But that happens, doesn’t it? Everyone’s got a little flutter now and then. I ain't no heart doctor, I just have one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do… or at least, I would if I could breathe. And don't go pokin' around too much, understand? I'm a delicate old man.
DOCTOR: Just a quick listen. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Hmm. Okay. Sounds a little congested, but nothing alarming… yet. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, pulse is regular but weak, and yes, there is some edema in your ankles.
PATIENT: Edema, you say? So, it is somethin'. I told you my shoes were tight! What does all this mean, doc? Am I gonna die? Don’t tell me I'm dyin', I ain't ready for that.
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous. You're not dying. However, it appears you may be experiencing some early signs of… fluid retention, likely related to your heart's ability to pump effectively. And that pill from your neighbor?
PATIENT: Fluid retention? Heart… pumpin'? See, this is why I came to a doctor! Not to get talked down to about my “fluid retention.” What about that pill? Was it doin' somethin' to me? Hemmings is always tryin' to fix things, even when they ain't broken. He probably got it from some fella at the bingo hall.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s difficult to say exactly what that pill was doing without knowing what it is. But unregulated medication can certainly contribute to fluid retention and other heart-related issues. It’s irresponsible, frankly. We need to run some tests – blood work, an EKG, and possibly a chest X-ray – to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’ll order those now.
PATIENT: Tests… more pokin' and proddin'? Ugh. Fine, do what you gotta do. But I don’t want no surprises, understand? And I want you to find out what Hemmings gave me. That man needs to learn to mind his own business.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. The tests are ordered. The lab will call when they’re ready. As for Mr. Hemmings, I suggest you politely, but firmly, decline any further “gifts” from him. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild diuretic – something to help get rid of some of the fluid. And I want you to limit your salt intake. Is there anyone who helps you with your medications or takes care of you at home?
PATIENT: Nobody. I live alone. Always have. Managed fine on my own for eighty-three years, I reckon I can handle a little fluid. But… maybe I should call my niece, Maria. She worries. Lives in Miami, though. Doesn't come visit much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it might be helpful to have someone check in with you. Here’s the prescription. Take this to your pharmacy. And I’ll have the nurse print out some information about limiting sodium in your diet. We’ll get these test results back as soon as possible, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Just one. Will this medicine make me sleepy? I like watchin' the baseball game. Don’t want to miss nothin’. And… will it make me need to pee all the time? I ain’t as quick as I used to be.
DOCTOR: It can cause some drowsiness and increased urination, yes. But it's usually mild. Try to take it in the morning. And, yes, you might need to go to the bathroom more often. It's a trade-off. But it’s better than being short of breath, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Short of breath is awful, you're right. Alright, morning it is. And I’ll keep away from that Hemmings. Maybe I'll tell him I’m allergic to… white pills. Yeah, that’ll do. Allergic to white pills. Thanks, doc. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. Try to get some rest, and limit your salt intake. We'll be in touch soon. The nurse will come by to review discharge instructions with you. .
PATIENT: Right. Alright then. Thanks again. Allergic to white pills… can't believe I had to say that. .
