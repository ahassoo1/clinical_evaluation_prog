DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, good to meet you too, I think. Uh... well, my wife, she says I need some papers. For… for when you need time off work, or… or if you can’t work. Something like that. She handles most of those things, you see. I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, honestly. It's about the church work, mostly. Directors, religious activities… that sort of thing. She said to ask you about FMLA or… disability? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right. FMLA, which stands for Family and Medical Leave Act, and disability. Yes, those are both possibilities, depending on the situation. It sounds as though your wife has anticipated a need for some time off from your… church work. To best determine what’s appropriate, let’s start with the basics. Could you tell me a little bit about why she feels these papers are necessary?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it's been a bit… difficult lately. Not anything sudden, just… getting older, I suppose. I tire easily, you know? And my memory… it's not what it used to be. She's been noticing, more than I have, probably. I still get to church, still do my duties, but… it takes more effort. I forget things during the services, little things. Names, mostly. And sometimes I just feel… drained. She worries I’m pushing myself too hard. That’s probably it. She's a good woman, my wife. Very practical.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue and some memory difficulties. It’s good your wife is attentive to these changes. And it's certainly prudent to address these things proactively. Could you quantify the fatigue for me?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh, dear. Is that… like how much tired? Well… before, I could work all day, no problem. Now, I need a nap in the afternoon, almost every day. And even then, I don't feel fully rested. It used to be I’d wake up feeling ready to go. Now… it's like I haven’t slept at all, even after eight hours. And it’s not just physical, you know? Mentally tired too. Hard to concentrate. Hard to… recall things. Like what I was just going to say… Oh, bother. See? That’s what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And how long has this been progressing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It didn’t happen all at once. It’s been… gradual. Maybe six months, maybe longer? Hard to say, really. I suppose it started with just needing a little extra sleep. Then the naps became necessary. And then… the forgetting. It’s like little pieces of me are… slipping away, bit by bit. My wife noticed the changes before I did. She has a very good memory, you see. Always has. I’d say… maybe the last three months is when it really became noticeable to me. That’s when she started talking about these papers.
DOCTOR: Very well. And, aside from the fatigue and memory issues, are there any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? Not snapping at anyone, but… less patient, I suppose. And sometimes I feel a bit… down. Not sad, exactly, just… a lack of… enthusiasm. For things I used to enjoy. It's not constant, but it comes and goes. And… now that I think of it, my balance isn't as good as it used to be. I haven't fallen or anything, but I feel a little unsteady on my feet sometimes. Especially when I stand up quickly. That’s all I can think of, really. It’s a bit of a jumble, isn’t it? Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, it's not a jumble at all, Mr. Limtiaco. This is all helpful information. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the flu a few times, naturally. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy. Playing football, silly thing. And… oh! I had my prostate checked a few years back. Nothing serious, the doctor said. Just… old age. I take a little pill for that now. And… I don’t think that’s all, but it’s all a bit fuzzy. I see the doctor for check-ups every year, but he never tells me much. Says I’m a healthy man for my age. I suppose I am, mostly. Nothing major, I can assure you. I’ve always been a strong man, Tahitian blood, you know. We’re a hardy people. But… that doesn’t mean I don’t have these little… troubles.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any other medications, besides the one for your prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. Only when it gets high, though. The doctor prescribed it, but I don't take it every day. Just when I feel… stressed. And… ah! I take a vitamin D supplement. My wife insists on it. Says I don’t get enough sun. That’s all I can think of. Really. Just those few things. Nothing regular, except for the prostate pill. She keeps track of everything, my wife. It’s a good thing, really. I’d forget my head if it wasn’t attached.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I eat pretty much everything. My wife cooks wonderful meals, and I enjoy them all. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing. Nothing like that. I used to get mosquito bites when I was a boy, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? We have plenty of mosquitos here. Just a nuisance, really. No, I'm pretty lucky, actually. No allergies to speak of. It’s one less thing to worry about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few neurological tests. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. My wife always says I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to doctors. But I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Lead the way. I'm ready when you are. Just… please be gentle. These old bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… good. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you could just follow my finger with your eyes… good… and now look to your right… and to your left… Excellent. No deficits noted in extraocular movements. And now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Could you please walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. There. Is that alright? I feel a bit… wobbly. I haven't walked this far in a while. It's not easy, you know? My wife says I should get more exercise, but… I just don't have the energy. Is something wrong? I felt a little unsteady just then. My balance isn't what it used to be, you know. It's a bit worrying, actually.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. I did notice a slightly unsteady gait, and you are right to point that out. It appears you do have some mild balance issues. We’ll need to investigate that further. Now, I’m going to check your strength… Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I’m trying my best. My grip isn’t what it used to be, you know. It’s getting harder to hold things these days. I dropped a plate just last week, shattered it all over the kitchen floor. My wife wasn’t very happy, naturally. She says I need to be more careful. But it’s not my fault, you know? My hands just aren’t as strong as they used to be. They feel… weak. And a little shaky. Is that a bad sign, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your legs. Can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s a little harder than it used to be, you know. My legs aren’t as strong as they used to be. I used to be able to lift heavy things, but now… it’s a struggle. I have to be careful when I climb stairs, otherwise I’m afraid I’ll fall. My wife says I should get a cane, but I’m not ready for that yet. It makes me feel… old. Is something wrong, Doctor? My legs feel… weak. And a little tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you. That will be all for the physical examination. Based on your reported symptoms and the findings of the physical examination, it appears you’re experiencing some concerning changes. The fatigue, memory issues, balance problems, and mild weakness are all red flags. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation, but we need to rule out several possibilities. I recommend a comprehensive blood workup, including a complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a CBC to rule out anemia. Additionally, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to evaluate for any structural abnormalities. Furthermore, given your reported cognitive difficulties, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. It's important to rule out conditions such as early-stage dementia or other neurological disorders. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that sounds like a lot. A lot of tests, a lot of… worry. Dementia? Are you saying… are you saying I might have dementia? I… I don’t understand. I just feel tired and forgetful. Is it that serious? I don’t want to lose my memory. I don’t want to… forget my wife. What if… what if it is dementia? What will happen to me? And all those tests… are they painful? Will they take a long time? I don’t have the energy for a lot of tests. What do you think is wrong with me, Doctor? Just… tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, please try to remain calm. I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. I want to assure you that I am not making any definitive diagnosis at this point. I am simply being thorough and exploring all possibilities to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The possibility of early-stage dementia is one we need to consider, but it is only one possibility. There are many other potential causes for your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even side effects from medications. That is why I am recommending a comprehensive workup. Regarding the tests, the blood work is relatively painless. It will involve a simple blood draw, and it should only take a few minutes. The MRI is a bit more involved, but it is also non-invasive. You will lie still in a scanner for approximately 30-60 minutes. There is no pain involved, but some people find it uncomfortable due to the confined space. I want to emphasize that the sooner we identify the cause of your symptoms, the sooner we can develop an appropriate treatment plan. Early intervention is crucial, regardless of the diagnosis. I will write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Kahananui, a highly respected neurologist in the area. I will also order the blood workup. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in approximately two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Kahananui… is she… good? Will she be able to… help me? And the blood work… how long will that take to come back? Two weeks… that seems like a long time. And what if… what if it is something serious? What kind of treatment would I need? Will it be painful? Will it… change me? My wife… she’s already worried about me. I don’t want to scare her. And the FMLA papers… should I still get those? If… if I do need time off work… What should I tell my wife? What should I say to her? I just… I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Dr. Kahananui is an excellent neurologist, highly regarded in the community. She has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders. I am confident she will provide you with the best possible care. Regarding the blood work, the results typically take 5-7 business days to come back. I understand your anxiety about the wait, but it's important to have accurate information before making any decisions. As for treatment, that will depend entirely on the diagnosis. If it is something serious, such as dementia, there are various treatment options available, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle modifications. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms, slow the progression of the disease, and improve your quality of life. I can assure you that we will explore all available options and develop a plan that is tailored to your specific needs. Regarding the FMLA papers, I believe it's prudent to obtain them. It's always better to be prepared, and having them in place will provide you with some peace of mind. If you do need time off work, it will streamline the process. As for what to tell your wife, I recommend being honest with her. Explain that you’re experiencing some concerning symptoms and that you're seeking medical attention to determine the cause. Let her know that you're doing everything you can to get a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. Her support is crucial during this time, and being open and honest with her will strengthen your bond. I understand this is a difficult time, Mr. Limtiaco. But please remember that you’re not alone. I will be here to support you every step of the way. We will work together to get a diagnosis and develop a plan that is best for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. You’ve… you’ve given me a lot to think about. And the papers… yes, please. The FMLA papers. I just… I just hope it’s nothing serious. And thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I think… I think I’ll go home now. And tell my wife. It’s going to be a long night. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.)
DOCTOR: You’re most welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I will have my nurse prepare the FMLA paperwork for you. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you and your wife all the best. .
