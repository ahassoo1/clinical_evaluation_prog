DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it's not really seeing you, is it? Just filling out some forms, like the lady at the front desk said. Medicare needs some stuff done, I think. I don't really know all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, paperwork can be…a lot. Okay, I see here you're 35 years old, Blackfeet Tribe, and your height and weight are noted as 171 centimeters and 70 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that all sounds right. That's me. I haven’t really had to think about centimeters and kilograms much, mostly just go by how my clothes fit, you know? But yeah, those numbers are good.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. And aside from the Medicare requirements, is there anything specific happening health-wise that you wanted to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything’s been… okay. I mean, normal aches and pains for someone who does what I do, running around fixing pipes and valves all day. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. I just figured I'd get this paperwork done while I was here, since it's convenient. Do you need me to fill out anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No acute concerns at the moment is helpful to know. Let’s just do a quick review of your overall health history, just to be thorough. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it, I think. And the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, measles… but nothing major. I haven't been in the hospital since I was little. I try to stay healthy, you know? Lots of fresh air and good food when I can get it. My grandma had some trouble with her heart, but that was years ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsils out as a child, and standard childhood illnesses, good to know. Family history of heart trouble is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. Was that on her mother's or father's side?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that was her mom's side, I think. It was a long time ago and my grandma didn’t talk about it much. She just said her mama hadn't lived to be very old. I don't know the specifics, like what kind of heart trouble it was, or anything like that. Sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Thyra. It’s good to have a general idea. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, not a thing. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a bad headache, but that's it. And not very often, thankfully. I try to drink plenty of water and get enough rest, that usually does the trick. Old habits from my grandpa, he swore by water.
DOCTOR: No current medications, good. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything there is, and never had a reaction. I work outside a lot, so I've been stung by bees a few times, but just regular bee stings, nothing serious. No hives or anything like that. You have a nice painting. Is that local art?
DOCTOR: Thank you, yes, it is! A local artist. Alright, good, no known allergies. Just to finish up the history, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, I told you, I'm a control and valve installer. So I’m on my feet all day, climbing around, lifting things… it's pretty physical work. I work outside a lot, rain or shine, so I get plenty of fresh air. I live with my husband just outside of town, we have a small garden. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it's hard when you're working long hours. No kids, just a couple of dogs. Does that give you a good picture? I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, like at parties or something.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Active job, healthy lifestyle otherwise. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I haven’t had a check-up in… well, a long time. So I guess it’s a good idea. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. What exactly will you be doing?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll start with your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Would you mind stepping up on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Scale first, right? Just let me take off my jacket… it’s getting warm in here. Here we go.
DOCTOR: Okay, 70 kilograms, as we noted. Blood pressure is 122/78, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses or organomegaly. Ears are clear, tympanic membranes are intact. Throat is clear, no erythema or exudates. Everything sounds and looks good, Thyra. Considering your history and the exam, and the fact that you are here primarily for Medicare paperwork…we don't have any pressing concerns at this time.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting much. So, what happens with the paperwork now? Do I need to fill out anything else, or… Do you send it somewhere, or…?
DOCTOR: Alright, I've documented everything we discussed today in your chart. I've also completed the necessary forms for Medicare. I'll submit them electronically. You should receive confirmation from Medicare directly. It may take a few weeks for processing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You answered everything I was wondering about, honestly. I just wanted to get it over with, and you made it pretty easy. Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough. I appreciate it. Do you have a card or something with the clinic number on it, in case I need to call?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's my card with the clinic number and my direct line. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up, even if it's just a question. It was a pleasure meeting you, Thyra. Stay well.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You have a good day too, Doctor.
