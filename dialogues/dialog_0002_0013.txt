DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been havin’ a little trouble… gettin’ all the pee out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops, sometimes. Feels like there’s still some left, but it won't come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So you're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate. It stops mid-stream, and you feel like there's still urine left inside. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s been happenin’… oh, I reckon about three months now. At first it was just now and then, but lately it’s been most times I go. It's gettin’ a bit worrisome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I can understand why that would be worrisome, Dondre. Three months is definitely long enough to want to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about the stream itself when it does flow?
PATIENT: Well, when it starts, it’s usually pretty strong. Normal, I’d say. Not weak or anything. But then it just… slows down real quick. And that’s when it feels like it stops, even when I push a little. It ain’t painful, mind you, just… incomplete.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the initial stream is good and strong, but then it slows down quickly and doesn't fully empty, even with some effort. No pain, just a feeling of incompleteness. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, odor, or any blood?
PATIENT: No, no blood or nothin’ like that. The color seems normal, I guess. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of coffee, so… The smell… well, it smells like pee, Doctor. I haven't noticed anything different 'bout the smell, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes to the color or odor of your urine. That's good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – like diabetes, or any problems with your prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me years ago I had high blood pressure, but I take pills for that. Been takin' 'em for a long time now. As for other things… nothin’ really. Never had trouble with my prostate, not that I know of. I mostly just try to stay warm and eat good.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. And no known prostate issues. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed 'em, thankfully. Just a few stitches when I was a young man, fallin’ off my dad’s boat, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my wife, bless her soul, she passed away five years ago. We didn't have any children. My brother lives out in Bethel, but we don’t see each other much. He’s got his own troubles. As for family history… that’s hard to say. Nobody ever really talked much 'bout illnesses, not back when I was growin’ up.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for family medical history to be a bit unclear. Okay, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned taking pills for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Let me think… the bottle says… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. And it’s… 20 milligrams, once a day. Every mornin’ with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like foods, pollen, or animals?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not even when I was a kid. I’ve been around animals my whole life, and never had any trouble with 'em. Just a plain man, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? You mean… checkin’ things… that way? Well… I ain’t real fond of that idea, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it’s an important part of evaluating why you’re having trouble emptying your bladder. It helps me feel the size and texture of your prostate, and it can give me valuable information about what might be causing the issue. We can discuss alternatives, but it would likely involve further testing like a bladder scan or a referral to a urologist. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail first?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose if it’s important. I just… don’t like the thought of it, that’s all. Could you tell me what it involves, exactly? And what you’re lookin’ for? I’m just a simple man, Doctor. I like to know what's happenin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It involves a brief examination of your rectum with a gloved, lubricated finger. It allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. We're looking for any enlargement, tenderness, or irregularities. It takes just a few moments, and I'll explain everything I'm doing as I go. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'll be as gentle as possible. We can skip it for now, but it will make it harder to figure out what’s going on. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: …Alright, Doctor. If you say it’s important, and you’ll be gentle… I reckon I can handle it. I don’t like it, but… I want to get this figured out. Just… please tell me what you’re doin’ as you go. And… hurry, if you could.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre, I appreciate you being willing to do this. I'll explain everything before I start and throughout the exam. I'll have you lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricant and a gloved finger to gently examine the rectum. I'm going to gently insert my finger into your rectum now. It may feel like you need to have a bowel movement, but it's just the sensation of the finger being there. I'm feeling your prostate now… It feels slightly enlarged, but it’s fairly symmetrical. There's no obvious tenderness. Okay, that's all for now. Okay, Dondre. I’ve documented my findings. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems likely that you have an enlarged prostate, which is common as men get older. This can cause difficulty emptying your bladder. We need to confirm this with further testing. I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and a prostate-specific antigen test, which is a blood test to help assess the size of your prostate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine test and a blood test… yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An enlarged prostate, you say? Is that… serious? Will I need surgery or somethin'? I ain’t a fan of surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, a urine test and a PSA blood test. We'll get those ordered right away. As for your question about seriousness – an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common, especially as men age. It’s rarely an emergency. Many men have it and live normal lives with minimal symptoms. Whether or not you’ll need surgery depends on how severe your symptoms are and how they affect your quality of life. We’ll start with the test results, and then we can discuss all the available treatment options, which include lifestyle changes, medications, and, in some cases, surgery or other procedures. We won't jump to surgery right away. We'll explore all the options before considering anything invasive. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds… reassuring. Not jumpin’ to surgery right away is good. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Just… get the tests done, and we’ll see what they say. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dondre. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once we have the results – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden inability to urinate, fever, chills, or severe pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any paperwork you need filled out before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I filled out everything when I first got here. Just… gotta remember about the emergency room if somethin’ bad happens. Thank you again for your time and help, Doctor Ranjan. You've put my mind a bit at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Just remember, if anything changes or you develop new symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Get some rest, and we'll be in touch soon. Have a good day! .
