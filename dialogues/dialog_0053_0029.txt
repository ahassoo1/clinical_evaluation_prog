DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Doyle Pitmon, Internal Medicine. Now, you’re 88 years young, which is…remarkable. But let’s get down to business. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor Pitmon. It’s nice to meet you. Remarkable, huh? Just keep movin', I always say. What brings me in… it’s my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, just a few bites and I feel like I ate a whole feast. It's been happenin' for a little while now, maybe a month or two.
DOCTOR: A month or two, alright. And it’s just the feeling of fullness, or are you experiencing any other symptoms with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really… not that I’ve noticed, anyways. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I figure that just comes with gettin’ older, you know? I haven’t been sick to my stomach or anything like that. No pain, just… full. Real quick. It's just kinda bothersome, makes it hard to enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Right, alright. No nausea, no vomiting, no abdominal pain. Just early satiety – feeling full quickly. And this is affecting your enjoyment of meals… so it’s impacting your quality of life a bit?
PATIENT: That’s a fancy way of puttin’ it, Doctor! "Early satiety"... yes, that's it exactly! And yeah, it's botherin' me. My wife makes a lovely salmon bake, you know, and I used to really look forward to it. Now I just pick at it. Don't want to waste it, but I just can't eat much. It’s not much fun, that’s for sure. I still feel hungry sometimes, just... can't get much down.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright, Mr. Obarr. Let's get a little bit of your medical background, just to rule things out. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, years ago, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. They put me on a pill for a while, but I stopped takin' it. Didn't like the way it made me feel. Been alright since then, as far as I know. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I suppose. I had a bad flu a few winters back, but I recovered from that. Nothing serious, really. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was a young man, fell off a roof. But that healed up fine. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Right, so hypertension in the past, managed with medication briefly, but off of it now. No other major medical history. Broken wrist years ago. And just the usual aches and pains. Any surgeries, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don't think so. Never had anything taken out or put in, not that I recall. Had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, way back when, but that was ages ago. That's about it, I think. Nothing else that I can remember, anyways. My memory ain't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy in childhood. No other surgeries. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she lived to be a good age, maybe 85, 90. She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end. My father, he didn’t live as long, passed away when I was still pretty young, heart trouble as well, I think. And my sister… she had diabetes, I believe. But that’s about all I know, really. We weren’t a family that talked much about health, you know? It was just… sort of assumed things happened.
DOCTOR: Right. Cardiac history on both sides of the family, and diabetes in your sister. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s another good question. No, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anythin', not that I can recall. I can eat just about anythin' they put in front of me, although I don't much care for beets, but that's just a matter of taste, not an allergy! I’ve never had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that either. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. Stopped takin' the blood pressure pill years ago, like I said, and haven’t needed anythin’ since. Just try to stay active and eat reasonable, you know? Although, with this stomach thing, it’s been hard to eat much at all. That's why I came to see you, Doctor. It’s just… not normal, feelin’ full after a few bites.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Mr. Obarr, you're a very stoic man, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what might be going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I’ve had doctors poke and prod at me before, no problem. You do what you need to do. I’m used to it, I suppose. Been livin’ long enough to get poked and prodded a few times! Just let me know if you find anything… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the exam table for me. I'm going to listen to your heart first. Heart sounds are… regular rate and rhythm, but I do detect a very faint murmur. Not particularly concerning at this point, given your age, but we’ll keep it in mind. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen is soft, no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. I do notice it feels… slightly distended. But not significantly.
PATIENT: Distended, huh? I hadn't noticed. I suppose I just carry a little extra weight around the middle, like a lot of folks do. Didn't think it was anything serious. No pain though, you said? That's good. I always worry about things when there's pain involved. Murmur, you say? I haven't had any trouble breathin' or anything like that. Just this full stomach thing. Is that somethin' you can figure out, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Obarr. The early satiety, the slight abdominal distension, the murmur... taken together, it's not immediately alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Given your age and lack of other symptoms, I don’t suspect anything terribly serious, but we need to rule things out. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis. We should also consider an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It's the best way to see what might be causing the early fullness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a lot of tests! Endoscopy, you say? That sounds… unpleasant. Is that really necessary, Doctor? I’m not sure I want to go poking around inside my stomach. I'm a pretty old man, and I've lived a good life. I don't want to go through a lot of fuss if it’s not really needed. Are there any other options? Maybe just keep an eye on it for a while? The blood tests, I suppose I can handle, but this endoscopy… I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Obarr. An endoscopy is not the most pleasant procedure, that's true. However, it’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. We need to rule out things like gastritis, ulcers, or even, though it’s less likely given your history, something more serious. We could start with the blood tests and stool sample, and monitor your symptoms closely. But if those come back normal, the endoscopy would be the next logical step. Alternatively, there's a non-invasive test we could consider - a fecal immunochemical test, which can help detect hidden blood in the stool. That wouldn't give us a complete picture, but it might give us some clues. What do you feel comfortable with at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… the blood tests and stool sample sound reasonable. And that fecal… immunochemical test, you said? That sounds a little less scary than stickin’ a camera down my throat. Let's start with those, I suppose. See what they say. And if they don’t show anything… well, then we can talk about this endoscopy thing again. But I'd really like to avoid that if possible, Doctor. I'm an old man, and I'm a little fragile, you know? Don't want to go through any unnecessary procedures. I trust your judgement, though, Doctor. You seem like a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. That sounds like a sensible plan. We'll start with the complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and the fecal immunochemical test. I'll write you the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just get these tests done and see what they say. And thank you for listenin’ to me and not pushin’ for this endoscopy right away. I appreciate that. You're a good doctor, I really do think so. It's good to know there's still doctors out there who take the time to listen. Now, where’s that lab you were talkin' about?
DOCTOR: Right through that door, and turn to the left. The receptionist will get you checked in. I’ve already sent over the orders electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. And Mr. Obarr… don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns, even if it's just to ask a question. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care.
