DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Alanes, it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s…well, it’s a bit concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy, I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out; it’s always best to address concerns like this. “A little while now” – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe a little longer? It wasn’t really bothering me at first, just something I noticed when I was… getting ready in the morning, you know? But it seems a bit bigger now, and I’ve started feeling a little…discomfort. Not pain, exactly, more like a dull ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months or so. And you’ve noticed it’s grown somewhat and now you’re experiencing a dull ache. Is the ache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It's not there all the time. It seems to be worse after I’ve been on my feet a lot, like after a long rehearsal. I’m a choreographer, so I’m… quite active, naturally. It's not crippling or anything, but noticeable enough that I thought I should see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a choreographer – that explains the activity level. And the discomfort is related to activity, which is helpful information. Now, can you describe the lump itself?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…firm, sort of hard to the touch. Not squishy, definitely not. It’s… about the size of a plum, I’d say? Maybe a little smaller. It’s located…just below my belly button, a little to the left. I’ve tried to feel for it myself, which I know isn't the best idea, but I wanted to get a sense of it before coming in. Is that…okay to share? I sometimes worry about overstepping.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to share, Amy, and I appreciate you being so proactive and observant. It's good you’ve been paying attention to it. Firm, plum-sized, located below the belly button and slightly to the left… That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any other changes – any weight loss, changes in your bowel habits, fatigue, fever, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, thankfully. My weight has been pretty stable, and my… well, everything else has been normal. I haven’t felt any more tired than usual, and no fever or anything. It really is just this lump and the occasional discomfort. I have been a little more… preoccupied, I suppose, worrying about it. But that’s probably to be expected.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, no other symptoms. Preoccupation is understandable, certainly. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic conditions, nothing like that. My wife handles most of the medical appointments, so I don't always remember the specifics of things, but she'd tell me if there was anything important. I'm Medicare eligible, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No significant past medical history. Medicare eligibility is relevant for billing purposes, thank you for mentioning that. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And my father had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing major on either side, as far as I know. No history of cancer, thankfully. We…we didn’t really talk about health much in my family. It wasn’t really encouraged, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Amy. It's common for health discussions to be avoided in some families. High blood pressure and heart trouble in your parents is helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to stay healthy, you know? Especially with the physical demands of my work.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Amy. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Nothing at all. I try to avoid medication if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a muscle ache after a long rehearsal, but nothing regular. I prefer to rest and ice it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Amy, I think we have a good overview now. I'd like to perform a physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump and check for any other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I was expecting that, to be honest. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Dr. Alanes.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm going to start by having you lie down on your back. I'll gently palpate your abdomen, starting away from the area of concern and then moving closer. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Okay… I do feel a distinct mass, approximately 3 x 2 centimeters. It’s firm, non-tender to light palpation, but slightly tender with deeper pressure. It appears to be mobile, meaning it doesn’t feel fixed to underlying tissues. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is otherwise soft and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Alright. Based on the physical exam, the mass is as you described – firm, mobile, and located in the lower left quadrant. The fact that it's mobile is reassuring, but we still need to investigate further to determine the cause. I would like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The CBC will help rule out any infection or underlying blood disorders, and the CT scan will give us a more detailed image of the mass and the surrounding structures. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan and blood work seem like a good next step. I trust your professional opinion, Dr. Alanes. Will the CT scan require any special preparation? And… what are we looking for exactly? I don’t mean to be difficult, I just like to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Amy. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand what’s happening. For the CT scan, you’ll need to drink a contrast solution beforehand to help visualize the structures in your abdomen and pelvis more clearly. The radiology department will give you specific instructions on how much to drink and when. You may also need to fast for a few hours prior to the scan, so we’ll provide you with a detailed preparation sheet. As for what we’re looking for, the CT scan will help us determine the size, shape, and location of the mass. We’ll be looking for any signs of malignancy, such as irregular borders or involvement of surrounding tissues. It will also help us identify any other abnormalities in your abdomen or pelvis. We want to rule out things like cysts, lipomas, or hernias. The scan will help us determine if further investigation, like a biopsy, is necessary. It’s important to remember that most abdominal masses are benign, but we need to investigate to be sure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense. So, the CT scan is mostly to get a clearer picture and rule things out. And if it looks suspicious, then we’d consider a biopsy. Okay. When can I schedule the CT scan? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have rehearsals scheduled, so I need to plan accordingly.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The CT scan is to get a clearer picture and rule things out. If it shows anything concerning, then we’d discuss a biopsy. Let me see… The radiology department has an opening tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM… yes, that should work. I can adjust my schedule. And the results? Roughly how long before we’ll have them? I understand it takes time, but a general timeframe would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll go ahead and schedule that for you. Typically, the radiology department sends the results to me within 24-48 hours. I will review them carefully and then contact you to discuss the findings and next steps. I’ll aim to have an update for you by Friday, at the latest. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I’ll contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you, Dr. Alanes. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly and answering all my questions. I think that’s all for now, isn’t it? Just schedule the scan and wait for the results.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. I’ve scheduled the CT scan for tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. You’ll receive a call from the radiology department with preparation instructions. I’ll be in touch by Friday with the results. Don’t hesitate to call if any concerns arise before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Amy. I hope everything turns out to be benign.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Dr. Alanes. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I appreciate it very much.
