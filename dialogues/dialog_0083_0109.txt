DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for maybe three days now. Not all the time, but... comes and goes. Like a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it doesn't feel like a bad headache, not like the ones I used to get when I was working hard. This is... different. It's more... constant, but not strong constant. And it feels... tight. Like a band around my head, maybe? It doesn't make me sick to my stomach, and I can still see okay. I just... don't like it. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a different kind of pain than headaches you’ve experienced before. More of a constant, tight sensation, like a band around your head, without nausea or vision changes. That’s helpful. And you said this started about three days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe four? It's hard to remember exactly. I was... well, I was outside. Helping my grandson with his... his garden. He's growing tomatoes. Big ones! But it was hot that day. Very hot. I had a hat on, but... still. I felt warm. Maybe that started it? I don't know. I've been resting since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around three or four days ago, potentially related to being outside in the heat while gardening with your grandson. You were wearing a hat, but felt warm. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Well... resting helps. When I lie down, it's not so bad. And... my daughter, she makes me tea. Chamomile, I think. That seems to calm it down a little. But... not much else. Eating doesn't change it, and… sleeping, it doesn't really matter either. It's there when I wake up. It's just... always there, a little bit. Not bad enough to keep me from doing things, but… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and chamomile tea seem to provide some minimal relief, but it’s generally a consistent pain regardless of other activities. Now, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Hmm... not really. I used to have a bad back, from all the work on the railroad. But that's old. Doctor fixed it years ago. My heart... the doctor checked it once, said it was okay. I get a little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old! That's to be expected, right? I don't take any pills, if that matters. Never been much for medicine. Just the tea, when my head hurts. And... I don't have insurance. Never could afford it, really. It is what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of back problems that were treated years ago, and a heart check that was normal. You experience some fatigue, which you attribute to your age, and you don’t currently take any medications. You also mentioned you don’t have insurance. That’s all very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and take a look at your head and neck. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds... good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just... be gentle, okay? My bones aren't what they used to be. I'll do whatever you need me to do. Blood pressure... yes, I remember those things. It's fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high, and your pulse is good. Now, I’m going to gently feel around the back of your head and neck. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. There's a little bit of tenderness back here, but nothing too concerning. Your range of motion is a little stiff, but I don’t feel any obvious abnormalities. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds are a little quiet, but regular, and your lungs sound clear. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck from being out in the heat. The limited range of motion and tenderness I felt supports that. It is also important to rule out other conditions.
PATIENT: Tension headache? Muscle strain? From the garden? That... makes sense, I guess. I was lifting a lot of dirt, helping him with those tomato plants. He wants the biggest tomatoes in the neighborhood! But… what does that mean? What do I do? And… is it serious? I don't want to end up in the hospital. I'm too old for that.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Brum, it doesn't sound serious at all. A tension headache isn’t usually a cause for major concern. It's very common. We can try a few things to manage it. I recommend continuing to rest, and the chamomile tea is good. I can also recommend some gentle stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders, which can help to relieve the muscle tension. I’ll write those down for you. Also, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the pain if needed. But since you don't usually take medication, we can start with the rest and stretching first and see if that helps. I would like to order some X-rays of your neck just to rule out anything else that might be going on, especially given your age. That will give us a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Hmm… I don’t know. I've never had X-rays before. Are they… safe? And… how much will they cost? I don't have much money, Doctor. I'm worried about the bill. Stretching sounds okay. And I guess I can try the tea... But the X-rays… I'm not sure. Can't we just try the stretching first? Maybe that will be enough. I don't want to spend money on something I don't need.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Brum. And you’re right to ask about the cost. I understand your financial situation. The X-rays will cost around $150-$200, depending on the imaging center. We can explore options for financial assistance or look for a lower-cost facility if that's a concern. However, given your age and the fact that this is a new pain, I do feel it’s best to rule out any underlying structural problems. It will give us peace of mind. We can start with the stretching and see how you feel in a week. If the pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, then we can proceed with the X-rays. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A week… yes, a week sounds good. I can try the stretching, and rest, and the tea. My daughter can help me with the stretching, she's good at that. And if it doesn't get better, then… then we can talk about the X-rays. But let’s try the stretching first. And… can you write down the stretching exercises for me? Big letters, please. My eyes aren't what they used to be. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. Here you are. These are very simple exercises. Do them slowly and gently, and stop if you feel any pain. Your daughter can help guide you through them. We’ll see you back in a week to check on your progress. If the pain gets significantly worse before then, or if you develop any new symptoms like numbness or weakness, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything very well, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And… thank you for not pushing the X-rays right away. That makes me feel better. I guess… I’ll just take it easy and try to grow some big tomatoes with my grandson. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your time with your grandson and those tomatoes! And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day to you as well.
