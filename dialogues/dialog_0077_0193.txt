DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pirl. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, um, it’s a bit… embarrassing, to be honest. I have… a lot of gas. More than usual, you see. It is causing me some… discomfort. I hope that is okay to say.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to say, Mr. Goodstein. Many patients experience digestive issues, and there’s no need to feel embarrassed. We're here to help. “A lot of gas” – could you describe the discomfort a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It is good to hear you say that. Well, it's… bloating, mostly. My stomach feels very full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And… well, the passing of gas. It happens often, throughout the day. Sometimes it is… loud. And, um, it smells… not very good, I suppose. It is not painful, exactly, but it is… bothersome. I just want it to stop being so frequent.
DOCTOR: Bloating and frequent gas… alright. And you mentioned it doesn't cause pain, just discomfort. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing over time?
PATIENT: It has been… developing over time, yes. It started, I think, maybe two months ago. Slowly getting worse, a little bit each week. I didn't think much of it at first, you know? Everyone has gas sometimes. But now… it is becoming a problem. It makes me… hesitant to go out, sometimes. I worry about it happening in public.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. It’s certainly understandable to feel self-conscious in that situation. Two months of gradual worsening… have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question, Doctor. I have been trying to pay attention. I… I do not know. Not really. I eat about the same as always. Maybe… beans? I had beans a few times in the last month, but I eat beans often and have never had this problem before. I do drink a lot of sparkling water, though. Perhaps that has something to do with it? I do not know. I'm not a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: Sparkling water… that’s good information. It could contribute. Let’s review some other possibilities. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this—any changes in your bowel movements, like diarrhea or constipation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. My bowel movements are… regular. Usual, you see? No diarrhea, no constipation. Everything is… going through normally, just with… extra gas. It is only the gas that is a problem. Nothing else has changed. I sleep fine, I eat fine, I feel… well, I feel okay, except for this. It is just… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, regular bowel movements, no other accompanying symptoms. And you say no changes in your diet besides possibly the beans. Do you have any known allergies, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I know of. Never have. I have eaten everything, you see. All sorts of things. No problems ever. I have never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, maybe not so strong now!
DOCTOR: Well, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, you see? I don’t like taking pills. I prefer to… just let things be, usually. That is why I waited so long to come in. I thought it would go away on its own. But, it has not. That is why I am here now. I hope you can help me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No medications. Okay. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92. Very healthy woman, until the very end. My father… he had some problems with his stomach, I think. Something about… ulcers? But he never went to the doctor much. He just… suffered through it. My sister is healthy as well. No stomach problems that I know of. I don’t think anyone in my family has ever had a problem like this, to be honest. Mostly just… strong people who don’t complain much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant family history of digestive issues. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean, Doctor? Do you mean… my hobbies? I like to walk. And read. Mostly history books, you see. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. I live alone, in an apartment. I do not have any… close friends, really. I used to work more with people, but now… not so much. I am a fast food worker, you see. Mostly just serving people, not talking to them. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Goodstein, that's helpful. Occupation, lifestyle… It gives us a better understanding. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask one final question. Do you have any known allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: I already said, Doctor, I do not have any allergies. None. Not to medications, not to foods, not to anything. I have eaten everything and never had a problem. I am very sure of this. I thought I already told you. Is something wrong? Are you thinking I am allergic to something?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Goodstein, please don’t be alarmed. I apologize, I simply want to be thorough. You've stated clearly you have no known allergies. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and do a quick palpation to see if we can identify anything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is alright. I understand you want to be thorough. It is good that you are careful. Yes, please listen to my abdomen and… palpate it, you said? Whatever you need to do. I will try to be still. Just… tell me if it will be uncomfortable. I do not want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Please lie back on the examination table if you're comfortable. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay… bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, normal activity. And now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. No significant tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. I do not feel any masses. Okay, everything seems normal on initial examination.
PATIENT: That wasn't so bad, Doctor. Not uncomfortable at all. It's good to hear it seems normal. But... if it is normal, why am I having so much gas? It is very bothersome, you see. It feels… embarrassing to even talk about, but it is really affecting my life. I hope you can find something to help me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Goodstein. It's good that we didn't find anything alarming on the physical exam, but that doesn't mean we can't investigate further to find the cause of your symptoms. Given your history and the exam findings, my initial thought is that this could be related to a few things. It could be dietary – even if you haven't changed much, sometimes subtle changes or sensitivities can cause gas. Or it could be related to the amount of air you're swallowing – perhaps while eating or drinking. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to make sure everything else is functioning normally. We can also consider a stool test to check for any underlying infections or imbalances. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it will help find the cause, I am happy to do it. Blood work and… a stool test. It is not very pleasant to think about, but I want to get to the bottom of this. I just want to feel normal again. I do not understand why so much gas. What do I need to do? Where do I go? Will it cost a lot of money? I have Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel that way about the stool test, but it’s a quick and simple procedure. As for the cost, Medicare should cover most of it, but there may be a small co-pay depending on your plan. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with information about the costs and co-pay amounts. The receptionist will also give you the lab requisition forms and instructions on how to collect the stool sample and where to drop off the samples. The blood work can be done at any Quest Diagnostics lab, there’s one conveniently located on Elm Street. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid carbonated beverages, like sparkling water, and eating slowly to minimize air swallowing. We can also discuss some over-the-counter remedies that may help relieve the gas. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Avoiding sparkling water and eating slowly… I can definitely do that. And over-the-counter remedies… yes, that sounds helpful. Elm Street, you said? I know where that is. I will go to the lab and get the blood work done. And I will collect the… sample. It is not pleasant, but I will do it. I hope it does not take too long to get the results. I just want to feel better. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. You have been very kind and understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I understand your concerns and we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. Once they're available, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address your symptoms. Here are the lab requisition forms and instructions, as well as some information about over-the-counter remedies. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, or fever – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very clearly. I have all the information I need. I will go get the blood work done, and collect the sample. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. It is a relief to finally be doing something about this. Goodbye, Doctor Pirl.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Get well soon. Goodbye, Mr. Goodstein.
