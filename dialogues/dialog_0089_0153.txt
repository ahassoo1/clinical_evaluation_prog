DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Right. The… performance thing. They said I needed a check-up. Something about being… cleared? For a show, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I mostly just usher these days, or sell tickets. Not much performing anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for a show… even if it’s just ushering, it’s good to get things cleared up. Let's get some details. When you say “performance thing,” can you tell me a little more about the show itself?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the show. It’s… a local theatre group. Small thing. I helped out with some… back-of-house stuff a while ago. Mostly just making sure people found their seats, you know? I think they're doing a play… or maybe a musical. Something with dragons, I vaguely remember someone mentioning dragons. It was… a favor, really. I don’t even remember agreeing to be… in it.
DOCTOR: Right, a favor turned into a potential performance. And they requested a check-up to ensure you're cleared for it. That’s sensible. To start, can you describe what they’re asking you to do in the show?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult. I believe… I’m helping with the stage management? Moving props, maybe? Or… assisting with costumes? It wasn't a very clear explanation. Mostly, I just showed up when they asked and… did what I was told. It was mostly lifting things, I think. Not heavy lifting, though, hopefully. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly light stage management, potential prop and costume assistance, with some lifting involved, but hopefully not heavy. That’s helpful. Let's talk about your back a bit. You mentioned it’s not what it used to be. Can you describe any pain or limitations you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, the back. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Comes and goes. Worse when I bend over for too long, or twist. Not sharp pain, just… a constant reminder it's there. It’s been… years, honestly. I just try to avoid doing anything that makes it worse. I can still walk around alright, but… lifting anything substantial is a bit of a struggle. And standing for long periods isn’t much fun anymore, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that worsens with bending and twisting, present for years, and limitations with lifting and prolonged standing. That gives me a better picture. Have you ever had any specific injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries… Hmm… That’s a good question. I… think so? A long time ago. When I was younger, I used to do a lot of… physical work. Moving furniture, things like that. I remember straining something… several times. But I don't recall any specific incident that was… particularly bad. It was just a gradual build-up of aches and pains over the years. I never really saw a doctor about it, to be honest. Just tried to… tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of strain from physical work, but no specific injury that you recall. And you haven't sought medical attention for it previously. Now, outside of your back, are you experiencing any other pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. My knees get a bit creaky sometimes, especially in cold weather. But that’s just old age, I suppose. And my hands… they ache a bit after doing a lot of… fiddly work, like tearing tickets. Nothing serious, though. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. I sleep alright, generally. And I haven’t been feeling unwell, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some creakiness in the knees and hand aches with activity – sounds like typical age-related wear and tear. Good to hear you’re sleeping well and feeling generally healthy. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… Medical conditions… I think… the doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high a few years ago. But I don't remember taking any medication for it. And… I think my blood pressure was a bit elevated once, but it went back down on its own, I think. Nothing major, though. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much. I just try to stay active and eat reasonably well. It’s mostly just the back that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated cholesterol and blood pressure in the past, but nothing requiring ongoing treatment. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils removed. And… I think I had an appendectomy once. But that was… decades ago. I haven’t been hospitalized since. Nothing serious, thankfully. Mostly just… little things, over the years. A bad cold, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and appendectomy in the distant past. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if it can. And… I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamin D occasionally, no regular medications, no smoking, and limited alcohol intake. That’s good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat pretty much everything. And… I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that in years. So, I don’t think I have any allergies. But… I could be wrong. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but you acknowledge your memory isn’t perfect. That’s fair. Finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… difficult. My parents are both… gone now. And I don’t have much contact with my relatives. I know my mother had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. And… my father had a bit of trouble with his… digestion, I believe. Nothing major, though. Honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We weren't really the type to… talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of heart trouble in your mother and digestive issues in your father, but limited details. Thank you for sharing what you remember. Alright, Brando, I see here you're uninsured and live in an urban area. And I see some previous blood pressure readings from a few years ago, as you mentioned, slightly elevated but not requiring treatment at that time. Now, before we move on, is there anything else you think I should know, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh… Well… I do get a bit… dizzy sometimes. Especially when I stand up quickly. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. I just try to hold onto something. And… sometimes I forget things. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my keys. Or what I was just saying. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness upon standing and occasional forgetfulness. That's helpful information. The dizziness is something we should investigate a bit further. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this… performance thing… sorted out. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. If you don’t mind, please sit up on the examination table for me. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now I will listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, normal breathing sounds. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Finally, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Balance is slightly unsteady, but nothing too concerning. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your balance is slightly unsteady, but everything else seems within normal limits. We need to look into the elevated blood pressure and the dizziness you mentioned. I would like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests… alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I don’t want to… inconvenience anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential problems. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll send the results to me. It usually takes a couple of days to get them back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and staying well-hydrated. Also, please try to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have access to a blood pressure monitor. Given your dizziness and slightly unsteady balance, I’d also like to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. They can perform some additional tests to rule out any neurological conditions. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Oh dear. More doctors… Is it… serious, Doctor? I just wanted to help out with this play. I didn't expect all this. But… if you think it’s necessary, then… alright. Yes, I’ll see a neurologist. Just… let’s hope it’s not too complicated. I’m not very good with… complicated things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brando. It’s not necessarily serious, but it's always best to be thorough, especially with dizziness and balance issues. The neurologist will likely want to do some imaging, like an MRI, to get a better look at your brain, but we’ll discuss those details when you meet with them. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to help get things under control. It's a very common medication with minimal side effects. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to take it. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise, if you’re able. Here's the prescription for the blood pressure medication, and these instructions explain everything in detail. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. It's a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate you taking the time to… sort me out. I just hope I can still help with the play. Even if I'm just… moving props.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brando. You're welcome. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, you’ll be able to continue with the play. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll follow up with you in a week to discuss the results of your blood tests and the neurologist appointment. In the meantime, focus on taking care of yourself and try not to worry too much. Have a good day, Brando. And please, if anything changes – if you experience new symptoms, or if your dizziness gets worse – call us immediately.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I’ll try not to worry. A good day… yes. Thank you again. .
