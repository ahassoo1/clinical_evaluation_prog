DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 67 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Reflux, mostly. And…well, things coming back up. Honestly, it’s a bother. I don’t have time for this, you know? I run the whole emergency management for the county. Important stuff.
DOCTOR: Reflux, yes. And “things coming up,” as you put it. I understand you have a demanding position; we will endeavor to be efficient. Can you describe this reflux for me?
PATIENT: Efficient is good. Look, it's heartburn, alright? Like after a bad pizza, but it happens even without the pizza. And then…well, stuff just comes up. Food, liquid… it’s unpleasant. I try to ignore it, but it's getting worse, and frankly, I don’t need this on top of everything else. It feels like it’s burning my throat, mostly.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation in the throat, even without dietary indiscretion. I see. How long has this been occurring, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… probably six, maybe eight months ago? It wasn’t bad at first. Just a little… annoyance. But the last month or so it’s been pretty consistent. Every couple of days, at least. Sometimes more. I haven't been keeping a log, if that's what you’re thinking. I have a county to run!
DOCTOR: A county, yes, I appreciate that occupies your time. Consistent occurrences over the past month. Does anything specifically trigger it, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though…lying down makes it worse. And sometimes after I eat, even if it’s just a little something. But not always! That’s what’s so frustrating. It's not like I can pinpoint a cause. And I don't have time for endless experimentation with what I eat.
DOCTOR: Lying down exacerbates the symptoms. Inconsistent triggers. I understand. Now, have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. It's more of… a discomfort. Like something's stuck, sometimes. Especially with solid food. Not every time, but enough to notice. It doesn’t stop me from swallowing, if that makes sense. Just… not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Discomfort, not pain, with solid foods. I see. And have you experienced any weight loss recently, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! If anything, I’ve…maintained. Perhaps a little less appetite lately, if I'm honest, because of this whole…situation. But I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Too busy.
DOCTOR: Maintained weight, decreased appetite. Alright. Now, do you take any medications regularly, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Blood pressure pill, small dose. And… I take an antacid sometimes, when it gets bad. The pink chalky kind. Doesn’t always help, though.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, PRN antacid. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Not to anything. Lucky, I suppose. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age. This reflux thing is just…a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Very well. To get a better understanding, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table for me. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to palpate your abdomen. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I really don't have time for a full examination. But fine. Fine. Just make it quick, alright? I have a meeting at ten.
DOCTOR: Heart and lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. I do note some mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region. No masses palpated. Mild epigastric tenderness noted. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting accompanying this reflux?
PATIENT: Nausea, sometimes. Not full-blown vomiting, thankfully. More of a… queasiness. Especially after eating. And when I lie down. It’s…unpleasant. I really don’t understand why this is happening. I eat reasonably well, I don't drink, don't smoke.
DOCTOR: Queasiness, particularly with eating and recumbency. Mr. Altine, based on your symptoms – the reflux, the mild epigastric tenderness, and the associated queasiness – it’s possible you may have gastritis, or potentially gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD. However, to determine the precise cause and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some tests. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an upper endoscopy. The endoscopy will allow us to directly visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? An endoscopy? Look, doctor, I told you, I don’t have time for this. And frankly, I don't like the sound of that at all. Isn’t there a pill you can just give me? Something to settle my stomach? I really don’t want to go through all that… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your concerns about time and the invasiveness of the endoscopy. However, a proper diagnosis is crucial to ensure we are addressing the root cause of your symptoms, and not simply masking them with medication. While I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – a medication to reduce stomach acid – it’s not ideal without knowing the underlying cause. The endoscopy allows us to rule out more serious conditions, such as Barrett’s esophagus or stomach ulcers. If you are unwilling to undergo the endoscopy at this time, I can prescribe a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, along with dietary modifications – avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and eating smaller, more frequent meals. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, you will need to undergo further investigation. Do you understand the risks and benefits of both approaches?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Just…give me the pill. The… proton pump inhibitor, you said? I'll try it. But if it doesn't work within a week, I'm not doing any poking and prodding. A week. And I expect a detailed explanation of what to eat and what to avoid. In writing. I don't have time for phone calls.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am prescribing you omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, for eight weeks. I will also provide you with a detailed written list of dietary modifications to avoid exacerbating your symptoms. I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your response to the medication. If your symptoms persist after eight weeks, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, weight loss, or bleeding, you should contact me immediately. Here is your prescription and dietary guidelines. Please review them carefully. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have a county to run.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I trust you will find some relief with the medication. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a…productive day.
