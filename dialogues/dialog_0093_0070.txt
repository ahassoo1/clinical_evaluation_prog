DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Doctor, yes? It's… a pleasure, I guess. New to this city, you know? Just need… the papers. For the old people's… thing. Medicare, they call it. Need to make sure I’m… covered. Something like that. Honestly, it's all a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It can be a bit confusing, setting things up with Medicare in a new location. We’re happy to help get everything sorted for you. So, if I understand correctly, you're here today primarily to establish care and ensure your Medicare coverage is active and accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s it. Just… make sure everything is working. I don’t want any surprises. And… look, I don’t really do doctors, okay? Never needed them much. Mostly just… faces. I make faces pretty. For the theater. You know? Not sick faces. Good faces.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Szmyd. It's excellent that you’ve been well enough to not require frequent medical attention. That's wonderful. We'll keep things as straightforward as possible. And I assure you, we can focus on establishing care without delving into anything unnecessary. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… health? Hmph. What do you want to know? I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I complain about my back. It's old. Everything is old. I used to be… stronger, you know? Lifting lights, moving things. Now… not so much. I don't get sick often. Maybe a little cold in the winter. But nothing major. My ex-wife, she always worried. Always.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That gives me a good starting point. You mentioned back pain – is that a recent development, or has it been something you’ve dealt with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the back? A long time. Years. From the theater work. Lifting, bending… holding things. It aches sometimes. I take… pills. Sometimes. The little white ones. Not every day. When it’s really bad. My… friend, she got them for me. Don't worry about the pills, okay? It's just an old man thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know that you've been managing the pain with medication. To ensure your safety and to understand the best course of action, could you tell me a little more about these "little white pills"?
PATIENT: Ugh. Why do you need to know everything? It’s… I don’t remember the name. My friend got them from… somewhere. She said they were good for pain. They help me sleep too, sometimes. Small, white… round. That's all I know, honestly. I don't ask questions, okay? It's not my business.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m pressing too much, Mr. Szmyd. It’s important for me to have a complete understanding of everything you’re taking, even over-the-counter medications or things a friend provides. This is to ensure there are no potential interactions with other things we might discuss, and to rule out any risks. If you don’t know the exact name, that’s perfectly alright. Perhaps you could describe the packaging, or where your friend obtained them?
PATIENT: Obtained? Hmph. She… knows people. Let's just leave it at that. Packaging? Plain. White bottle. Nothing fancy. Just… pills. Look, I don’t like talking about this, okay? It feels… strange. I come to the doctor for papers, not an interrogation. Can we just finish with the papers?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to feel that way, Mr. Szmyd. I apologize again for making you uncomfortable. We can certainly focus on the paperwork and establishing your Medicare coverage. However, I do want to briefly ask a few general questions about your medical history, to ensure everything is accurate. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Maybe? The ex-wife always went on about it. She liked doctors. Made me go for checkups. Lots of poking and prodding. I think they said something about numbers. Too high. But I don’t remember. Diabetes? No. Never. I like sweet things, but… no diabetes. Heart… I don’t know. I feel it beating, if that counts. Honestly, I can’t keep track of all of this. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. It's helpful to have this information, even if it's uncertain. The fact that you had a blood pressure check in the past is good to know. To continue, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmph. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a child? A tonsil thing? I don’t remember. Hospitalized? Once, maybe. I fell off a ladder. Helping with the lights. Broke my arm, I think. It was a long time ago. They fixed it. That’s all. Not important.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, don't even get me started. A mess. My mother… she worried a lot. Died young. Heart problems, they said. My father… he was… absent. Never around. I have a sister, somewhere. Haven't seen her in years. She’s probably fine. Everyone on that side of the family… always complaining about something. Not a healthy bunch, if that's what you want to know. A lot of aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That’s helpful. To complete the picture, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Disgusting habit. Alcohol… sometimes. A little wine with dinner. Nothing heavy. Used to drink more… when the ex-wife was around. Recreational… What do you think I am? I’m a makeup artist, not a… whatever you're implying.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize for the implication, Mr. Szmyd. It was not my intention to offend you. It’s simply standard procedure to ask about these things. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little itchy sometimes… from certain makeup products, but nothing serious. Not life-threatening. I used to react to… something in the theater smoke, but they stopped using that stuff. I think that’s it. I’m pretty resilient, if you want to know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That’s very helpful. Alright, it sounds like you’re generally healthy, with a history of back pain, potential high blood pressure in the past, and a family history of heart problems. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam—just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. More poking and prodding? Fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we finish, the quicker I can get those papers. I have… things to do. But make it quick, okay? And be gentle. My skin is sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds good, a little fast but regular. Your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 92. Your throat looks clear. Your abdomen is soft. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Elevated? See! I told you my ex-wife was always worrying about things. Numbers, numbers, always numbers. What does "monitor" mean? More checkups? More poking? I just want the papers! Is that it? Can we finally talk about the papers now? I have to get this Medicare thing sorted, you know. It's a whole mess.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd. We can certainly focus on the paperwork now. "Monitoring" simply means checking your blood pressure again at a follow-up appointment, and discussing lifestyle modifications—like diet and exercise—that can help lower it. It doesn't necessarily mean frequent checkups or invasive procedures. Alright, let’s get these forms sorted. I see here you’re newly eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B. We just need to verify your information and ensure everything is accurate. Do you have your Medicare card with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, cards… I think I have it somewhere. In my wallet, maybe? Or the other wallet. I have so many pockets… Wait… here it is! It’s a mess, I know. I’m not organized like my ex-wife. She kept everything in perfect order.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly alright, no need to apologize for the organization. The card looks fine. I’m just confirming your name, date of birth, and Medicare number. Everything matches. We’ll need to confirm your address and preferred pharmacy. Do you have a local pharmacy you’d like to use for your prescriptions?
PATIENT: Prescriptions? Oh. No, not really. I don’t take many. Just… the little white ones, when my back is bad. I don’t really have a “preferred” pharmacy. Somewhere close, I guess. I just go wherever is easiest. I don’t drive anymore, so… walking distance is good. Just put whatever is closest, okay? I’m not fussy.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see a few options within walking distance. Let’s use “City Pharmacy” – it's just a few blocks away. Now, we just need to review everything to ensure it’s accurate. Name, date of birth, address, Medicare number, and preferred pharmacy… everything looks correct. Alright, your enrollment has been submitted. You should receive a confirmation letter in the mail within the next few weeks. In the meantime, you can access your Medicare benefits online through the Medicare website. Here’s a copy of the enrollment summary for your records. It includes the date of submission and a contact number for Medicare if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Finally. Papers. Okay. This is all very confusing. I don’t really understand websites. I just… want to be covered. You know? No surprises. No, I think that’s it. Unless… will this cover everything? Like, if I need… something serious? Or just the basics? Just tell me yes or no. Will it cover everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, Medicare Part A and Part B cover a wide range of healthcare services, including doctor's visits, hospital stays, and preventative care. However, it doesn’t cover everything. There are deductibles, co-pays, and some services that aren’t fully covered. For example, vision, dental, and hearing care are generally not covered by basic Medicare. Additionally, long-term care or skilled nursing facility care is typically not covered. To ensure you have comprehensive coverage, you may want to consider a Medicare Supplement plan—also known as Medigap—or a Medicare Advantage plan. These plans can help cover some of the costs that basic Medicare doesn't. I strongly recommend speaking with a Medicare specialist to discuss your specific needs and determine the best coverage options for you. I can provide you with a referral to a local specialist if you'd like. But to answer your question directly: it will cover a significant amount of your healthcare needs, but it’s not a comprehensive, all-inclusive plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Ugh. Of course. More things to worry about. More plans. More numbers. It’s a mess. No. It doesn’t make sense. It never makes sense. Forget it. Just… let me have the papers. I’m too old for this. Thank you. I think. I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I understand your frustration. I apologize for the complexity of the Medicare system. Here’s my card. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if you decide you’d like a referral to a Medicare specialist. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. I wish you good health, and I hope you have a restful day. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Goodbye.
