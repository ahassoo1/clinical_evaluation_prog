DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat. It’s… well, it's my stomach. Been having trouble with it for weeks now. Just… constant diarrhea. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing persistent diarrhea and have already tried over-the-counter remedies. I appreciate you being upfront about wanting to get straight to the point. Weeks is a significant amount of time to be dealing with this. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the diarrhea a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It’s… watery. It’s… the color of, well, you know. Brown. Sometimes lighter. Sometimes… not. Is this really necessary? I just need something to stop it. I’ve already wasted enough time on this.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem tedious, Ms. Woodring. It's important to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause and best course of action. The color and consistency can give us clues. You mentioned it varies – lighter or… not – could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a doctor. I don’t know what “consistency” means beyond… liquid. And sometimes it’s almost yellow, and sometimes it’s… darker. Like, really dark. Okay? I ate some blueberries a few days ago, maybe that's why it was darker then. Honestly, I don’t keep track of every single… movement. It's embarrassing even talking about this. Can’t you just give me something for it? I’m a busy person.
DOCTOR: I understand this is uncomfortable to discuss, and I apologize for pressing you. It’s perfectly alright if you don't want to go into extreme detail. The information you’ve provided is helpful. The change in color, especially with the darker stools, is good to know. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Ugh. Well, I’m tired. Really tired. More tired than usual, and I always feel tired. And… my stomach cramps, obviously. It hurts. It feels… bloated. Like I’m going to explode, sometimes. And… I haven't been very hungry. Everything just feels… off. Is that good enough? I really don’t see how this is helping.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Woodring. Fatigue, cramping, bloating, and loss of appetite—those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let's go over some more general questions. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No. No fever, no chills. I haven’t felt sick sick, just… awful. Like this never-ending… problem. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have appointments. Important ones. I took time off just for this, and frankly, I'm starting to regret it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I assure you I'm trying to be as efficient as possible. We're getting there. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve never been sick enough to have a diagnosis, honestly. I’m generally… healthy. Or was healthy. Before this. My husband… well, he handled all the doctor stuff. I just… went when he told me to. I don't really keep track of things like that. Is this going to be on a test? Because I'll probably fail.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Woodring. It’s common for one partner to take the lead on healthcare matters. We don’t need a perfect memory here, just the information you can recall. Okay. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I told you, I'm generally healthy. Look, I'm starting to feel… dizzy. Is this room hot? I don't like being in here. Can we just get to the part where you give me something to fix this? I'm not a fan of hospitals or doctors, never have been.
DOCTOR: I apologize if you're feeling unwell, Ms. Woodring. Let me adjust the temperature in the room. And I understand your discomfort with medical settings. I’ll do my best to make this as quick and efficient as possible. Okay. Let's briefly touch on your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. My family… well, we don't really talk about that stuff. My mother… she wasn’t very forthcoming. And my husband’s side… I barely knew them. Look, I’m Tlingit. We have… different priorities than keeping track of family illnesses. Can we please just skip this part? It’s not relevant. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand and respect that, Ms. Woodring. We can certainly skip that part. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… the usual. Pain relievers for my back. It acts up sometimes. And a multivitamin, I guess. I don't even remember buying it, my neighbor probably got it for me. Honestly, I barely take anything. I don't like putting things in my body. I just took some stuff from the drugstore for this… diarrhea. It didn't work. Obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Look, I'm getting a headache. This is ridiculous. I've answered all your questions. Can we please just get to the part where you give me something to stop this? I have things to do, people to see. I wasted a whole morning on this already. I’m starting to regret coming here. Frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I apologize for the lengthy questioning, but it's important to rule out potential causes. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes. I'm hearing some… mild cramping and tenderness in your lower abdomen. There’s no rebound tenderness, thankfully. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which could explain some of the bloating you mentioned. I'd also like to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respiratory rate. Your vital signs are stable, but the tenderness and distention are concerning. Given your history of persistent diarrhea, fatigue, and cramping, I'd like to order some lab work to help determine the cause. I'm thinking a complete blood count, electrolytes, a stool culture to rule out any infection, and a C-reactive protein to check for inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? Look, I don’t do tests. I don’t like needles. I don’t like doctors. I don’t like… any of this. Can’t you just give me something? An injection, maybe? Something strong? I’m a grown woman. I know my own body. I just need something to stop it. Honestly, this is a waste of my time and energy. Can’t you just… prescribe something? I'll sign whatever you need me to sign. Just get me out of here. I’m starting to feel really lightheaded again. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety and reluctance, Ms. Woodring. I truly do. However, prescribing medication without knowing the cause of your diarrhea could be harmful. It’s important to rule out serious conditions like infection or inflammatory bowel disease before starting any treatment. Given your lightheadedness, I’m concerned about dehydration. I’m going to recommend we start with IV fluids to rehydrate you. It’s the safest course of action right now. While we’re giving you fluids, a phlebotomist can draw the blood for the lab work. It's a small blood draw, and we’ll get the results as quickly as possible. Would you be willing to allow me to start the IV fluids?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t have all day. And make sure it’s not cold. I hate cold things going into my veins. Honestly, this is… humiliating. I've never had to do any of this before. Just… be quick about it. And don't poke me too much. I have a very low tolerance for needles. And no small talk, please. I'm not in the mood. Just… do it. I just want to feel better. And then I’m leaving. Immediately. Don't expect me to come back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll make sure the fluids are at room temperature. I’ll also avoid small talk. There. All done. The fluids will slowly infuse over the next hour. A phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. In the meantime, I’ll step out and review your chart and prepare a preliminary plan based on what we’ve discussed so far. I will be right back to check on you. Please let the nurse know immediately if you experience any discomfort, pain, or shortness of breath.
