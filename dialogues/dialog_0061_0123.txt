DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Carla. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my skin, see? It’s been so itchy. Just driving me crazy, it is. It started a couple of weeks ago, I think…maybe a little longer. It’s all over, really. Arms, legs, back… everywhere!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Very itchy skin all over, starting a couple of weeks ago. That sounds incredibly frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about the itch?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a… a rash, exactly. It doesn’t look different, you know? Just…itchy. Really, really itchy. Sometimes it’s worse at night, keeps me up. And it's not like one little spot, it’s all over. I’ve tried lotion, different kinds, but nothing really helps for long. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explaining things sometimes.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Carla. No rash, just intense itching all over, worse at night, and lotions aren’t providing much relief. That helps me a lot. And don’t worry about explaining – we'll figure it out together. Now, has anything changed recently that might be causing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. My routine is pretty much the same. I eat about the same things… I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, that I know of. Oh! Well… my granddaughter, little Sofia, she was staying with me for a week, and she has a new laundry detergent with a really strong smell. I washed all her things, and my towels and sheets when she left. Could that be it? I didn’t think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Carla! A new laundry detergent used for your granddaughter’s things could definitely be a trigger. It’s good you mentioned that. Now, besides the itching, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… let me think. No fever, no tiredness, nothing like that. My appetite is okay. I have been a little more…restless, I guess. Because of the itching, you know? Keeps me tossing and turning. And sometimes, when I scratch…well, it gets a little red, but it goes away pretty quick. It's not like a big, bumpy rash, just… red when I really get at it. It's hard to describe. Oh, and I think my skin feels a little dry, even with the lotion. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all important information, Carla. No fever or tiredness, increased restlessness due to the itching, some redness from scratching that resolves quickly, and a feeling of dryness. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if that’s alright. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let’s see… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now with medication. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Nothing else major, I don't think. Oh! And I’m allergic to penicillin, if that matters. I found that out a long time ago. Does that cover it? I sometimes forget things, you know. I try to remember, but… things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Carla. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and a penicillin allergy. That's important information, thank you for sharing. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I’ve been taking it for…oh, a long time now. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take over-the-counter ibuprofen. But not very often. It doesn't always help much, to be honest. And that’s it, really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar skin problems, like eczema or really bad allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she had really sensitive skin, always complaining about rashes. Not exactly the same as this, but she was always scratching at something. And my brother, he had pretty bad allergies as a kid, always sneezing and sniffly. But I don’t think anyone had itching all over like this. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually. Didn't have many problems at all. Is that helpful? It's hard to remember things from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Carla, thank you. A history of sensitive skin in your mother and allergies in your brother. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, not anymore. I used to have a little wine with dinner sometimes, but that was a long time ago. Doctor Kimm, I don’t really do much these days, to be honest. I like to read, and I spend time with my granddaughter when she comes to visit. Mostly just quiet things. Gardening a little, when the weather is nice. Nothing too strenuous, you know? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol, and mostly quiet activities. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to take a look at your skin and make sure there's nothing else going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s just my skin, but it's been driving me crazy, so I'm happy you're taking a look. Please, go ahead. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold or anything. My skin is pretty sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carla. It won’t be cold, I promise. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, then take a look at your skin. I’ll start with your arms and legs. Okay, everything sounds clear. And I do see some dry skin on your arms and legs, but no obvious rash or bumps. There is some mild redness in areas where you’ve been scratching, but that’s understandable. Your skin feels warm and dry overall. I'm not seeing anything alarming, thankfully. Based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it sounds like you're experiencing generalized pruritus - that's just the medical term for itching all over. Given the recent use of new laundry detergent for your granddaughter’s things, that's a strong possibility, especially with the timing. However, we want to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check your liver function and thyroid levels, just to be sure. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, liver and thyroid, you say? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I mean, I feel fine, other than the itching, you know? But if you think it’s best to check, then yes, of course. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want this itching to stop! It’s driving me nuts. Is it going to be a lot of blood? I don’t do well with needles, you know. Just a little prick, I hope? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m going to visit my daughter next week… I hope I can get this figured out before then.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions, Carla. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned. Checking your liver and thyroid levels is just a routine step to rule out any underlying causes for the itching. It doesn’t mean something is wrong, it just helps us be thorough. It’s a standard blood draw, just a little prick, and yes, it won't take much. The amount of blood taken is very small. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. We should have them before your visit to your daughter. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your regular laundry detergent to see if that helps. Also, try to avoid scratching as much as possible, as that can make the itching worse. I can prescribe you a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation and itching. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good, Doctor. A cream sounds nice, anything to stop the scratching! And yes, I’ll switch back to my regular detergent right away. Sofia won’t mind, I’m sure. She just likes to visit. 3-5 days… that’s not too bad. I can wait. And what about the cream? Does it have a lot of side effects? I’ve heard some creams can thin your skin… I don’t want that, you know. My skin is already so dry. Is it a strong one? Maybe a mild one would be better, if that’s possible? I’m just a little worried about putting something on it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Carla. It’s good you’re asking about potential side effects. We’ll start with a mild topical steroid cream – hydrocortisone 2.5% – to minimize any risks. It’s the lowest strength we typically use for this type of itching, and it's very safe for short-term use. Rarely, with prolonged, high-dose use of steroid creams, it can thin the skin, but we’re only using it for a week or two to see if it helps, and it’s a very low strength. I’ll give you clear instructions on how to apply it – only to the itchy areas, twice a day, and to avoid using it on your face. If you see any redness, burning, or worsening of the itching, stop using it immediately and let me know. I’ll also write down the instructions for you, so you have them handy. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Hydrocortisone, a mild one… and just for a week or two. And only on the itchy parts. And I'll watch for redness and burning. You’re very thorough, you know? I appreciate that. A little worried about it still, but I'm willing to try anything to get some relief. So, you’ll send the blood work to the lab, and I’ll pick up the cream at the pharmacy? And if it doesn't help, or if it gets worse, I should call your office, right? Oh, and do I need to fast for the blood work? I had a big breakfast this morning… I should have asked before!
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right, Carla. I’ll send the blood work to the lab – it’s just down the hall, and they’ll take care of it. You’ll pick up the cream at your pharmacy. And yes, if it doesn’t help, or if it gets worse, please call the office right away. We’ll get it sorted out. And no, you don't need to fast for the blood work. It doesn't require a fasting sample, so your breakfast is perfectly fine. Here’s the lab order and the prescription for the hydrocortisone cream. I’ve also written down some instructions on managing the itching and the potential side effects of the cream. And my office number, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me today, Carla?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know about the breakfast. Thank you. And thank you for writing down the instructions, that’s very helpful. Let me see… hmmm… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just been so frustrating, this itching! I’m hoping this cream will do the trick. I'll switch back to my detergent right away. And I’ll call if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And I hope you feel better soon! Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your visit with your daughter next week.
