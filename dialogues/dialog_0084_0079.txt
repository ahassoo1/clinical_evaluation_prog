DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Courtnye. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, I’ve been bruising really easily lately. It’s kinda scary, honestly. I'm on one of those blood thinner pills, and it seems to be getting worse, even though I take it like I’m supposed to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is definitely something we need to look into. And just to confirm, which blood thinner are you currently taking, and for how long have you been on it?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s called… Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. And I started it about… six months ago, give or take. The doctor back in town put me on it after my heart flutter scare.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for six months post-heart flutter. Good to know. And have you had your INR checked regularly since starting it?
PATIENT: INR… checked? Honestly, Doctor, I get so confused with all the names of things. The other doctor just told me to take it and call if I felt weird. I don’t think I’ve had anything… checked. Does that make sense? I feel silly even asking.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t make you sound silly at all, Courtnye. It's very common to be confused with medical terms. The INR is a blood test we use to make sure the Warfarin is at the right level – not too high, which can cause bleeding, and not too low, which can cause clots. It's very important to have that checked regularly when you're on Warfarin. Okay. So, tell me a bit more about these bruises. Where are they appearing?
PATIENT: Okay, good to know about the test. I should’ve asked about that. The bruises… they’ve been showing up mostly on my arms and legs. Just… popping up, even with little bumps. Like, I’ll brush against something and boom, a bruise. Yesterday I had one on my hip for no reason at all. It’s kinda scary, like my body is just falling apart. They don’t hurt too bad, but they’re definitely bigger and more frequent than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, arms and legs, appearing with minimal trauma, and increasing in frequency and size. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really, no. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just… life, you know? No bleeding gums or anything like that. No nosebleeds. I haven’t fallen or anything, just the bruises showing up for no reason. Does being tired count?
DOCTOR: Yes, being more tired than usual is good to know. Fatigue can sometimes be related. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at those bruises. After that, we'll need to get some bloodwork done to check your INR and some other things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just wanna get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s kinda freaking me out.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you'll just have a seat up here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take some deep breaths for me… in and out… Everything sounds normal so far. Now, can you point to where you’ve been getting the most bruising?
PATIENT: Okay. This one here, it showed up just yesterday. And then, mostly on my legs, like here… And there was one on my hip, but it’s fading now. It’s kinda all over, but those are the worst ones right now. It’s hard to say exactly why they showed up, honestly. I just noticed them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. The bruises do appear quite extensive for minimal trauma. There’s no obvious swelling or redness beyond the bruising itself, which is good. Let's get some bloodwork ordered to check your INR, complete blood count, and a few other things just to rule out any other possibilities. I’ll also need a list of any other medications or supplements you're taking. Do you take anything else?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin, I guess. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, but not very often. Like, once a month, maybe less. And… oh! Sometimes I take ginger for nausea, but that’s only when I’m feeling sick. That's about it. I don't really take a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and ginger when needed. That's helpful. Alright, I'm going to write you a lab order. You can take this to the lab down the street. They’re open until 5 pm today. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or you can have them faxed directly to the clinic. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Faxed to the clinic is probably easiest. So… just go to the lab, get my blood taken, and then call to make an appointment? How long should I wait for the results, roughly? I’m kinda anxious about this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Go to the lab, get your blood drawn, and they can fax the results here. It usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the results to come back. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any new, excessive bleeding - like nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or any unusually heavy bruising - please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. New bleeding, go to the ER. Got it. Okay. Well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. I'm just hoping it's nothing too serious. I’ll go get the bloodwork done tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. We'll get to the bottom of this. Just remember, if anything changes or you're concerned, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day.
