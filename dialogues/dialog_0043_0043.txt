DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. Feels like a tight band, sometimes. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, I’d say a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, but it’s there often enough to be a pain, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A persistent headache can certainly be disruptive. Could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… well, it’s not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more… dull. Like someone’s tightened a rope around my head. And it kinda radiates down the back of my neck sometimes. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It doesn’t make me wanna lie down in a dark room, but it makes it hard to concentrate, especially when I’m lookin’ at numbers for long periods. Which, as you can imagine, is most of my day.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull, band-like pressure radiating to the back of your neck, and it interferes with concentration, particularly when focusing on detailed work. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these headaches, or make them worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. You know, I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I’ve been tryin’ to think on it… I work a lot at my desk, so maybe that’s it? Bad posture, I guess. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to sit up straight. And sometimes, if I get really stressed about a client’s finances, it seems to get a little worse. But it’s hard to say for sure. It just… comes and goes. I haven't changed anything in my routine lately, not really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No specific triggers identified, but potentially related to prolonged desk work and stress. And no recent changes to your routine. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. Not nauseous or anything like that. My vision’s been fine, I think. I read the stock reports every day, and haven’t had any trouble. I have been a little more tired lately, now that I mention it. But I figured that was just gettin’ old. Eighty-four years takes a bit outta ya, you know? And my appetite’s been alright, maybe a little less than usual, but nothing major. I haven't noticed anything else out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: I understand. No fever, dizziness, nausea, or vision changes. Some increased fatigue and a slightly decreased appetite, but otherwise feeling generally well. Now, let's go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it’s been under control for a long time now. I don't take any pills for it anymore. My regular doctor took me off ‘em after a few years. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbin’ a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. Knock on wood. No major illnesses, no surgeries. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Gibbel. Controlled hypertension in the past, with medication discontinued, and a childhood wrist fracture. No other significant medical history or surgeries. And you mentioned no major illnesses. Now, concerning your family history, are there any conditions that run in your family – things like headaches, heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about health. My parents… they weren’t ones for goin’ to doctors. My mother, she had some arthritis when she got older, real bad in her hands. And my father… well, he just worked himself to death, really. Long hours, hard labor. I don’t think he had any specific illnesses, just… wore his body out. As far as headaches or heart trouble… I don’t recall anyone havin’ serious problems with those. My siblings… well, we’ve all kinda gone our separate ways over the years, and I haven’t kept close track of everyone’s health. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It wasn't something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gibbel. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Arthritis in your mother and your father working a physically demanding job. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn’t like it. As for alcohol… I might have a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, but not often. Maybe once a month. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those. I’ve always believed in takin’ care of myself. Good food, regular exercise… well, as regular as an eighty-four-year-old can be. Mostly walkin’, these days. I like to get outside when the weather’s nice.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Gibbel. Very healthy habits. Now, regarding any allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I haven't had any reactions to any medications in the past, either. I had a penicillin shot when I was a kid, and that was fine. I haven't really had much reason to take pills, thankfully. My daughter always asks me when she takes me to the doctor, but I always tell her I’m not allergic to anything. I've just always been a pretty sturdy guy, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Gibbel. No known allergies. Now, just to confirm, you mentioned you aren’t currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. No pills, no creams, nothin’. I used to take somethin’ for the blood pressure, but that was years ago, and the doctor took me off of it. I’ve always tried to avoid takin’ too many pills if I can help it. I figure if I can stay healthy through good food and exercise, that’s the best medicine there is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also examine your neck and head to assess any tenderness or muscle tension. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’ at me, to be honest. I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual. I’ve always been pretty open with doctors, I believe in bein’ honest about what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Let’s begin. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, regular. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to palpate your neck to check for any tenderness or muscle tension. I do note some mild tenderness in the posterior neck muscles, particularly along the upper trapezius. No palpable masses or enlarged lymph nodes. Finally, I’ll assess your range of motion in your neck. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and you report some discomfort with flexion and extension. Overall, the physical exam reveals mild tenderness and limited range of motion in your neck muscles, with a slightly elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Hmm… that doesn’t surprise me much about the neck, to be honest. I do feel a bit stiff sometimes, especially after I’ve been sittin’ at my desk for a long time. And I guess the blood pressure’s not great, but I’ve been a little stressed lately with some of my clients. So that probably explains that. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? Do I need to worry about it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gibbel, based on the examination findings, I don’t believe it’s anything immediately serious. The tenderness and limited range of motion in your neck muscles are likely due to muscle tension, possibly related to your desk work and stress. The slightly elevated blood pressure could be a temporary response to stress as well, but it's something we should monitor. Given your history and the physical exam, my assessment is tension headache and possible mild cervical muscle strain. To rule out other potential causes, and to get a better baseline for your blood pressure, I’d like to order a few simple tests. Would you be amenable to a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I’m not a big fan of tests, to be honest. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgement. I just don’t want to spend a whole lot of time runnin’ around gettin’ poked and prodded. Are they gonna be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel. These are routine blood tests, and they shouldn’t take too long or be overly invasive. The CBC helps us rule out any underlying infection or anemia, the BMP assesses your overall kidney function and electrolyte balance, and the TSH test checks for thyroid issues, which can sometimes contribute to headaches. Regarding cost, I’m not certain of the exact amount, as it depends on the laboratory. However, I will have the billing department contact you with a cost estimate before the tests are performed, and we can discuss options if needed. I will also write a note requesting the most affordable pricing available given your financial situation. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headache, and I’ll give you some exercises to help relieve the neck tension. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. As long as it doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg, and I can get the results pretty quickly. And the exercises sound good. I’m always willing to try somethin’ to help. I’m just not a fan of bein’ stuck in a doctor’s office all day. So if we can keep it simple, that’d be great. I appreciate you writin’ a note about the cost, that’s very kind of you. Alright, let’s go ahead and get those tests done, then. When and where do I need to go?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad we could come to an agreement. I’ll write the orders for the CBC, BMP, and TSH tests now. You can go to the laboratory located at 123 Main Street, right across the street from the clinic. They are open Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. You don’t need an appointment. Just bring this requisition form and your insurance card, if you have one, although you mentioned you are uninsured, so that’s not a concern. In the meantime, I’m going to print out a handout with some simple neck exercises you can do at home. These exercises involve gentle stretching and range of motion movements. Please perform these exercises three times a day, and stop if you experience any pain. I'll also prescribe a mild muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help relieve the neck tension. Take one tablet at bedtime as needed. Once the lab results are back, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cyclobenzaprine… that sounds like a big word. Is that gonna make me sleepy? I need to be sharp for my clients, you know. And is there anything else I should be lookin’ out for? Any symptoms that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Gibbel. Cyclobenzaprine is a muscle relaxant, and drowsiness is a common side effect. However, the severity varies from person to person. I recommend starting with a lower dose—5mg instead of the standard 10mg—and taking it only when absolutely necessary, ideally before bedtime. If you experience excessive drowsiness or any other bothersome side effects, discontinue the medication and contact me. Regarding symptoms that would warrant an earlier visit, please contact me immediately if you experience: Severe headache that doesn't improve with over-the-counter pain relievers. Fever, stiff neck, or rash. Weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs. Changes in vision. Difficulty speaking or understanding. Otherwise, we can review the lab results during your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to my concerns and not rushin’ me. I’ll go get those tests done and try those exercises. And I’ll be careful with that muscle relaxant. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. I feel much better now knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance and a plan of action. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
