DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But, I have been... passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual. It started, I think, maybe two weeks ago? It is not painful, just… frequent. And sometimes, it smells. Very strong. It is a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Excessive flatulence. And it's been two weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately two weeks. Though, it is hard to pinpoint exactly. It was gradual, not sudden. I try to remember things very well, you see, and I recall noticing it getting worse over those days. It happens throughout the day, mostly. After meals, certainly, but also… just at other times. Is that important, Doctor? Whether it is only after eating?
DOCTOR: It can be. Diet is… frequently a factor. Though, not always. Do you notice any particular foods seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. I do try to eat healthy. Mostly. I like cabbage, you see. And beans. Perhaps those? I eat a fair amount of both. Also, sometimes I have… fizzy drinks. Not every day, but occasionally. I do not know if that matters. Is fizzy drink a problem? And I like onions, very much. Perhaps it is something I eat.
DOCTOR: Cabbage, beans, onions… fizzy drinks. Yes, all potential contributors. And how would you describe your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is a… personal question. But, alright. They are… regular. Every day, usually. Not too hard, not too soft. Normal, I would say. A normal color, also. I pay attention to these things, you see. Is it bad that I do? They are formed, yes, definitely formed. And… complete. If that makes sense. No… urgency, or… straining. Nothing like that. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Regular, formed, normal color… no urgency. That's… helpful. Any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. No pain. No sickness, nothing like that. Sometimes, perhaps, a little… fullness, after eating a large meal. But not really bloating. It is just… the gas. That is the problem. Just lots of… escaping air. It is embarrassing, especially if I am out. Do you understand? A little… disruptive. I do not want to be rude to people. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you likely have a bit of… excessive intestinal gas. Often dietary. We can try some… adjustments. First, let’s review your medications and any allergies you might have. Do you take any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. None at all. I try to stay healthy, you see. And no allergies. I have never had a reaction to anything. Not food, not… anything. Just the gas. That is my problem. A bit of a nuisance, but not… life-threatening, I assume? Perhaps some advice on what to eat, or not eat, would be helpful. Do you have suggestions?
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, no allergies. Very well. You’ve already identified some likely culprits – cabbage, beans, onions. Fizzy drinks as well. Try eliminating those for a week, and see if there’s any improvement. Also, consider reducing your overall fiber intake. Sometimes too much fiber can contribute to gas production. We can also discuss over-the-counter remedies if the dietary changes aren't enough, but let's start there. Do you have any family history of digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Alright. No cabbage, no beans, no onions… no fizzy drinks. That will be… difficult, but I can try. I do enjoy those foods. But I want to feel better, you see. My mother… she had stomach troubles, yes. Not gas, exactly. More… discomfort. And… irregularity, sometimes. But she did not go to the doctor much. She did not like doctors, you see. And my father… he had no problems. A very strong stomach, my father. So, just my mother. A little trouble, but not… like this. I hope I am not getting her trouble, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of digestive issues in your mother, but not a direct correlation to excessive gas. Alright. We’ll keep that in mind. For now, let’s focus on the dietary changes for a week. If you don't see improvement after a week of eliminating those foods, we can discuss some over-the-counter options like simethicone or activated charcoal. However, those are generally just symptomatic relief. If the gas persists despite these measures, or if you develop any other symptoms—abdominal pain, bloating, changes in bowel habits, weight loss, fever—you need to come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand very well. No cabbage, no beans, no onions, no fizzy drinks for one week. And if it does not improve, then… simethicone, or… activated charcoal. And if I get pain, or… feel unwell, I must come back. I will remember all of that, you see. It is a lot to remember, but I am very good at remembering things. One week, then… we see. Is there anything else I should do? Perhaps… a special tea? Or a… walk after eating? I read that can help, you see.
DOCTOR: A walk after eating is unlikely to be harmful, and can aid digestion for some people. As for special teas… there’s little evidence to support those. Focus on the dietary changes and see how you respond. If, after a month, you’re still experiencing significant issues, then we can consider further investigation – perhaps some blood tests or stool samples to rule out any underlying conditions. But let’s not jump to conclusions. For now, I want you to try the elimination diet. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have been very helpful, you see. A walk after eating… I can try that. And no cabbage, no beans, no onions, no fizzy drinks for one week. I will remember it all. And if it does not improve, I will come back. Thank you, Doctor Dechene. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try those measures, and feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein.
