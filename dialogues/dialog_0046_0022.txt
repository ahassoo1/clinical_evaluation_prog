DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… feels off. I don't really remember when it started, just… slowly. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly okay, Soila. It’s common for things to develop gradually. “Feels big” and not wanting to eat… those are good starting points. Could you tell me a bit more about the “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… big. Like… full of water, maybe? Not hard, you understand? Soft. And… it’s uncomfortable when I lie down. Not painful, just… there. It’s hard to explain. I used to be a sociologist, you know. I studied people, not bodies! This is… new for me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is different being on this side of things. “Full of water” and uncomfortable when lying down… that’s helpful. Not painful, just a general discomfort. To get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Well… not really. It's… regular, I think. Maybe a little less than usual, but I don't keep track, you know? Old lady problems. Everything slows down. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright, Soila. It's good you're telling me. And it’s not just "old lady problems," changes in bowel habits can be important, but it's good to know things are generally regular. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite besides just not feeling like eating as much?
PATIENT: Oh dear… nausea… that's when you… feel sick to your stomach? No, no sickness. And I haven't thrown up. Just… not hungry. Food doesn’t seem as good anymore. Everything tastes… blah. Even my favorite pickles! And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but I’m ninety years old! That’s normal, right?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Soila, feeling tired at ninety is perfectly normal. And a loss of appetite with food tasting “blah” is helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask about any past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… let me think. I had… the flu, many times. And a bad cold once, when I was young. I broke my wrist, a long time ago. And… oh! I had a problem with my heart, many years back. They gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them. It was a long time ago, and I felt better. Did I tell you I used to be a sociologist? I studied people, not medicine! It’s all a blur. I don't remember the name of the heart problem.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila, don't worry about remembering specific names. Flu, a broken wrist, and a heart problem in the past… that’s good to know. Do you recall why you stopped taking the pills for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, the pills… Well, I felt fine! The doctor said I needed them, but I felt perfectly good. And they made me feel… funny. A little dizzy, maybe? And I didn’t like taking pills. Old lady, you know. I don't like being poked and prodded. So I stopped. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she says you should always listen to your body. Maybe she’s right.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Petrov sounds like a wise woman. It’s good to listen to your body, but sometimes medications are important, even if you feel okay. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mama… she had a bad cough when she was old. And my papa… he had something with his stomach, I think. He was always complaining. But everyone complained, you know? We were Russian! Lots of complaining. And my brother… he was healthy as a horse, until he… well, he passed away when he was young. Not a sickness, just… an accident. I don’t remember much about it. Is that helpful? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, Soila, that is helpful. A cough in your mother, stomach problems in your father, and your brother passing away… I’m sorry to hear about your brother. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, no allergies. I eat everything. Pickles, mostly. And borscht, when my neighbor makes it. I used to be allergic to dust, when I was a little girl, but I grew out of it. I don't think I've ever been allergic to anything important. I'm a tough old lady! Physical exam? Is that going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt at all, Soila. It’s just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few other things. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Just the vitamins. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she said I need them for my bones. They're little gummy bears. Strawberry flavor. And sometimes, when my joints hurt, I take a little something… a white pill. But not every day. I forget what it’s for. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind. Do you need to know what the pill is? I don’t think I have it with me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila, we can talk about it later if you remember. Vitamins and a white pill for your joints… that's helpful. Okay, then. If you’re comfortable, let’s go ahead and do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay… an exam table. Is it cold? I get cold easily. Alright, alright. Let's get it over with. Just be gentle, dear. My bones are old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle. And yes, the table can be a little cold – here, let me put this warm blanket under you. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Take nice, slow, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little… distant, and I hear some… crackling in your lungs. Not anything to be alarmed about yet, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is… soft, and there’s some mild tenderness in the lower part. No hard lumps or masses that I can feel. Your pulses are a little weak, but steady. And your reflexes are a little slow, which is common at your age. Alright, Soila. That’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I think we need to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Testing? Oh dear… what kind of testing? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And I don't want to be poked and prodded. Is it serious? I just want my tummy to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about testing. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. The first thing I’d like to do is a blood test. It's a simple blood draw, and yes, it involves a small needle, but it’s very quick. It will help us check your overall health, look for any signs of infection, and see if your vitamin levels are okay. We’ll also need to do a urine test, which just involves collecting a sample in a cup. That doesn't involve any needles at all. And finally, I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound. This uses sound waves to create a picture of your tummy, and it’s completely painless. It will help us see your organs and check for any abnormalities. These tests will help us figure out what’s causing your discomfort and make sure we get you the right treatment. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s important to investigate, especially since you’re feeling unwell. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… lots of tests. Blood, pee, and… sound waves? It all sounds very complicated. I don’t know if I can remember all of that. Will someone help me with the tests? I don't think I can do it all by myself. And… what if the tests show something bad? I'm an old lady, dear. I don’t want to be poked and prodded and… and scared.
DOCTOR: You won’t be alone, Soila. Absolutely not. Our wonderful nurses will be with you every step of the way to help you with all the tests. They will explain everything clearly and make sure you’re comfortable. And yes, it can be scary to think about what the tests might show, but we'll take it one step at a time. If we do find something that needs attention, we'll discuss all your options carefully and make a plan together. We’ll focus on making you feel better and improving your quality of life. We'll start with the blood and urine tests. We can do those here at the clinic today. The ultrasound will require a separate appointment, but we can schedule that for a time that’s convenient for you. How about we focus on getting through the blood and urine tests first?
PATIENT: Alright… if I have someone with me. And if it doesn’t take too long. And if it doesn’t hurt too much. The blood… I always get dizzy when I see blood. And the pee… is it a special cup? And the ultrasound… will it be cold? I get cold so easily. Alright, dear. Let’s get it over with. But promise me someone will hold my hand. And explain everything slowly. I'm an old lady, you know. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I promise, Soila. I will be right here with you, and our nurses will be too. I will explain everything slowly and clearly, and we'll take breaks whenever you need them. Yes, it’s a special cup for the urine test, but don’t worry, it’s very easy to use. And we’ll have a warm blanket ready for you during the ultrasound. Let’s get you comfortable, and I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the blood draw process. Then we can get that done, and you can relax. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright… a blanket and someone to explain things. That sounds… okay. Just please be gentle, dear. And don’t rush me. I’m an old lady, you know. It takes me a little longer to do things. And… thank you. For being so kind. It’s scary being alone in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It's my pleasure. And don't worry, we'll take all the time you need. I'll call the nurse now. She'll come in shortly and explain everything about the blood draw. “Nurse Petrov to exam room three, please.” Just relax for a moment, and I'll be right back with the nurse. Is there anything I can get you in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, dear… I think I’m alright for now. Just… a little nervous. And cold. But a blanket is coming, you said? That’s good. Just… please don’t let them poke me too much. And explain everything slowly. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you know. It’s an old lady problem.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. No poking, and everything will be explained slowly and clearly. We’ll take things at your pace. I promise. Here’s a little extra warmth for you. And don't worry, I won't let anyone rush you. Just focus on taking deep breaths, and we'll get through this together. “Good morning, Soila! Dr. Glowka mentioned you were a little nervous about the blood draw. I’m here to explain everything and make sure you're comfortable.” “Nurse Petrov is wonderful, Soila. She’ll take good care of you.”
PATIENT: .
