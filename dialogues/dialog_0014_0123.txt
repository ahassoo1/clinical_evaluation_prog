DOCTOR: Alright, Carla, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes, it’s this…itching. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just…annoying, you know? Not painful, just really itchy. Everywhere, it seems.
DOCTOR: Osterholm, yes. And everywhere… that’s…vague. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, excuse me. Yes, you're right. Everywhere… well, my arms, mostly. And my legs. A little on my back, but I can’t always reach to scratch it properly, so it’s not as bad there. It started, I think, a couple of weeks ago? Maybe a month. It comes and goes, but it's been pretty consistent lately. I just thought it was the heat, honestly. It’s been so humid!
DOCTOR: Humidity… yes, that’s what everyone says. Still, we should rule things out. Have you changed any soaps or lotions recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. I've been using the same stuff for…oh, years, probably. Dove soap, mostly. And a simple lotion, Aveeno, for after my shower. Nothing fancy. I don’t really have sensitive skin, usually. Except for…well, sometimes the sun, but that’s different. I always put sunscreen on.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other new products?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I can think of. No new laundry detergent, no new fabric softener. Oh! Wait. My granddaughter, she bought me a new perfume for my birthday last month. A floral one. I wore it a couple of times, but… honestly, it smelled a bit too strong for me, so I haven’t used it since. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Perfume… possibly. It could be a contact dermatitis. Let's take a look. Could you please turn around?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. It's probably nothing, I'm sure. Just an old lady with itchy skin. But thank you for looking at it, Doctor. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some mild excoriation – that’s scratching, essentially. Skin’s dry. Not much redness, thankfully. Same here. Any fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I checked myself yesterday, actually, just because of the itching. Felt fine. No chills or anything like that. Just…itchy. It’s worse when I get warm, I think. Like after a shower, or when I’ve been doing a little gardening. That’s why I thought it was just the heat at first.
DOCTOR: Gardening… so you're exposed to plants, potentially allergens. And warm showers… that can dry out the skin. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… no, not really. No rash, no blisters, no swelling. Just the itching. And it doesn’t seem to be getting worse quickly, just… constant. Sometimes it feels a little bit… bumpy? Like tiny little raised spots, but they disappear after a while. I don’t know if that makes any sense. And I’ve been a little more tired lately, but that could be anything, really. I’m an old lady, you know! Things just…start to ache.
DOCTOR: Bumpy… that’s helpful. Fatigue… well, that’s non-specific. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, not that I know of. I eat everything! Well, I try to eat healthy now, but… I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No bee stings, no food allergies, nothing like that. I used to have hay fever when I was a little girl, but that went away years ago. I don’t even sneeze anymore, really. It's funny, isn't it? How things change.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like a mild irritant dermatitis, possibly exacerbated by the heat and gardening. I'm going to recommend a topical hydrocortisone cream – over the counter is fine. Apply it twice daily to the affected areas. And try to avoid scented products. Are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… Just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it's called. I've been taking it for…oh, maybe ten years now? And a little vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm also going to recommend an oral antihistamine, like Benadryl, for the itching, especially at night. Start with half a tablet and see how you respond. Any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, Benadryl…yes, I've taken that before for allergies. Makes me sleepy, doesn’t it? But if it helps the itching… Okay. No, I don’t think so. So, hydrocortisone cream twice a day, and Benadryl at night… Do I need to come back if it doesn’t get better? I just don't want to bother you if it's nothing, you know? A little old lady with itchy skin…
DOCTOR: If it doesn't improve in two weeks, or if it worsens at any point – if you develop a rash, blisters, or any other symptoms – then come back. We’ll consider other possibilities, but for now, let’s try this. And try not to scratch. It'll only make it worse. Any other concerns today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that’s all, Doctor. Thank you very much. You’ve been very helpful. And I will try not to scratch. It’s just…so tempting! It's just itchy skin. I'm sure it's nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Osterholm. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Right. Get dressed, and the nurse will give you the discharge instructions. .
