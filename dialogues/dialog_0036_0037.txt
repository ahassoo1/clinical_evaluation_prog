DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. My… my breathing. It is making a whistling sound. A wheezing, I think my daughter said. It troubles me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Margret. A whistling or wheezing sound with your breathing. That is something we should definitely look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. It comes and goes. Not all the time. More when I have been… moving. Like, if I walk up the hill to the market, or after I do my exercises. It is not so bad when I am resting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it seems to be triggered by activity, and improves with rest. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It started small, I did not pay it much mind at first. I thought it was just because I am getting older. But it has been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks, gradually getting worse. And has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, the pollen has been very bad this year. My eyes have been a little itchy, and I have been sneezing more. But I have allergies every year, so I did not think much of it. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be important, Margret. Allergies and breathing can definitely be connected. Do you know what you're allergic to, specifically?
PATIENT: I… no, not really. The doctor many years ago, he did a little poke test on my arm, but I do not remember what he said. Just that I have allergies. Lots of people do, no? I mostly just take some pills when it gets bad. Over the counter.
DOCTOR: You're right, many people do have allergies. And over-the-counter medications can be helpful. What medication are you currently taking for your allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… it is a little blue box. Cetirizine, I think it says on the front. One tablet every day when the pollen is bad. I get it at the store. Is that… enough information? I am sorry if I am not very clear.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Margret. Cetirizine is good to know. And yes, that is helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit more about your breathing. Besides the wheezing, have you noticed any coughing?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not a bad cough, but it is there. It is mostly in the mornings, after I wake up. Just a little tickle in my throat. And sometimes after I have been exercising. It is not… a deep cough, if that makes sense. More of a… clearing my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild cough, mostly in the mornings and after activity. Any shortness of breath with the wheezing or activity?
PATIENT: Sometimes. When I walk up the hill, like I said, I have to stop and rest a little more often than before. Not… struggling for air, but I am more tired. It is hard to explain. I used to be able to walk up that hill without any trouble at all. Now… it is just a little harder.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little harder than usual, needing more rest. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I do not think so. The doctor checked my lungs many years ago, but he did not say anything about asthma or… COPD. I had pneumonia once, when I was very young, but that was a long time ago. I do not remember much about it. I hope that is helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. No history of asthma or COPD, just pneumonia as a child. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I have not. Never had any surgeries. I try to stay healthy, you see. I do my exercises, I eat my vegetables… I have been very lucky, I think. No need for any surgeries, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, let's talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have asthma, COPD, or other lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My mother, she had a cough for many years, but I do not think it was asthma. More of a smoker’s cough, I think. She smoked for a long time. And my brother, he had some trouble breathing when he was a boy, but it went away. Nothing else, I do not think. My father was very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with a smoker’s cough, brother with childhood breathing problems, but otherwise a healthy family. One last thing about your history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I do not smoke. My mother smoked, like I said, but I always thought it was a terrible habit. Very bad for your health. I have always stayed away from it. And I do not drink much alcohol either. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, no smoking history, minimal alcohol. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Could you please sit forward a little bit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and out… again… and out. I do hear some wheezing, especially when you exhale. It’s not terribly loud, but it’s definitely present. I also notice you're breathing a little faster than normal. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good, but your respiratory rate is elevated. Now, I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. Wheezing, you say? That is not good, is it? I hope it is not anything serious. My daughter will be very worried. I am a little worried myself, to be honest. What do you think it could be, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're checking it out, Margret. While it's too early to say definitively, the wheezing and slightly elevated breathing rate could indicate a few things. It could be related to allergies, as you mentioned, or a mild asthma flare-up, even if you haven’t been diagnosed with asthma before. It could also be bronchitis. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your heart rate is 88, which is normal. Given your history and what I'm hearing, I think we should do a quick chest X-ray just to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or bronchitis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh dear. I do not like the sound of that. But… if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Pneumonia… that sounds terrible. I do not want that again. Will it… hurt? And how long will it take? My daughter is picking me up later, and I do not want to keep her waiting too long.
DOCTOR: No, Margret, an X-ray doesn't hurt at all. You'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your chest. It's very quick, usually just a minute or two. And the radiation exposure is minimal. We can get it done right here in the clinic, and it shouldn’t delay your daughter’s pick-up by too much – maybe 15-20 minutes total. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of an inhaler to help open up your airways. It's a bronchodilator, and it should help relieve the wheezing. We can adjust the treatment plan once we have the X-ray results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An inhaler… alright. That sounds… good, actually. If it will help me breathe easier, then yes, I would like that. And 15-20 minutes… that is not too bad. My daughter is very understanding. She worries about me, you see. What kind of inhaler is it? And how do I… use it? I have never used one before. I do not want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: It's a common inhaler called Albuterol. It comes with a counter, so you know how many puffs are left. You'll want to shake the inhaler well, then take a deep breath and exhale completely. Then, put the mouthpiece in your mouth, creating a tight seal. As you start to inhale slowly and deeply, press down on the canister to release the medication. Continue inhaling deeply for about 10 seconds, then hold your breath for another 10 seconds. Repeat that once or twice. We'll have the nurse show you again before you leave to make sure you're comfortable with it. We’re prescribing it two puffs every four to six hours as needed. And let’s go get that chest X-ray done now. It's just a precaution, but it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Two puffs… every four to six hours. I think I can remember that. And I will ask the nurse to show me again. I do not want to mess it up. Yes, I am ready. Let us get this X-ray done. The sooner we know what is going on, the better. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. That's what I'm here for. The technician, Sarah, is very good. She'll explain everything to you step-by-step. I’ll be here looking over the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss them as soon as you get back. Let me know if you have any questions at all during the process. And don't worry, we'll figure this out together. .
