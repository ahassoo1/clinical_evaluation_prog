DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s August 2nd. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Oh… yes. The speaking, it’s been a bit… off, lately. I wouldn't say difficult, exactly… just… not quite right. It’s hard to explain. I just know it’s not how I usually sound, you see?
DOCTOR: I see. "Speaking off, not quite right." Okay. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it feels like… my tongue is heavy, sometimes? And the words… they sort of… slur together. Not all the time, mind you. It comes and goes. It’s just… worrying, because I need to be clear when I’m on the job site. I’m a construction manager, you see, and precise instructions are… well, important. It hasn’t been too bad, but I thought it best to get it checked. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. “Tongue feels heavy, words slur together, intermittent, concern with work performance due to need for clear communication.” So, it’s not constant, and it’s affecting your ability to give instructions at work. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that’s a tricky question. Honestly? I can’t quite pinpoint it. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or so? It’s not a sudden thing, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. I just noticed it becoming more pronounced, recently. It's all a bit… hazy, truthfully. I apologize for not being more specific.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Ms. Swaby. It’s common for things to develop gradually. “Onset approximately one month, gradual progression.” And has anything specific triggered this, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmmm… That is… a good question. Not that I can recall, no. Nothing unusual happened, not really. I’ve been working as usual, sleeping as usual… eating fairly well, I think. My husband makes sure of that. It's just… appeared. I haven't been ill or anything, and I haven’t injured my head or anything like that, either. It's just… been happening. I really wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful. It’s good you haven't experienced any trauma or illness that might be related. Okay. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Do you have any other symptoms besides the change in your speech?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think carefully. Not that I've noticed, no. No headaches, no dizziness… no blurry vision. My hands aren’t shaking, and I don’t feel weak. I suppose I'm… just a bit tired, sometimes, but that's just life, isn't it? It’s been a busy summer, with all the projects at work. I can't think of anything else, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, or tremors. Just occasional fatigue. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor told me a while back, but it's generally well-controlled with medication. Other than that… nothing serious, I don't think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… that sort of thing. And I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, but that was many years ago. It was a long labour, but I recovered well. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Ms. Swaby. That's very helpful. “Hypertension, well-controlled with medication. Difficult childbirth in the past.” And do you recall what medication you are currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that is a good question. I take a pill every morning, a small white one, I think? But I honestly don't know the name of it. My husband handles the refills, you see, and he brings me the medication. I just… take it. I feel terrible admitting that, but it’s the truth. I should probably pay more attention, shouldn’t I? Is it important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, but it’s fairly common. We can look it up in our system using your insurance information, Ms. Swaby. Ah, here we are. You are currently prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, that’s right! Yes, I think that's the name. My husband will be pleased I remembered something! As for surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a child, a long, long time ago. And I had a C-section with my son, as I mentioned earlier. Other than those two… nothing else, Doctor. I've been quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendix removal in childhood, C-section. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of, no. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of foods, and I haven't had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that. My skin doesn't get itchy or anything, and I haven't ever had a rash from taking a pill. I suppose I'm… quite resilient. Though, my husband always tells me I should be careful, just in case.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Now, just a few more questions about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have experienced neurological conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a difficult one. My family... we don't really talk about health issues, if you know what I mean? It's just not something we discuss openly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she was a bit forgetful towards the end of her life, but that was just old age, I think. And my uncle, he had a stroke, I believe, many years ago. But other than that… I honestly don’t know, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… not something I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It's common for family health history to be incomplete. Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, as I said, I’m married, and I work as a construction manager. We live in a suburban area, quiet neighbourhood. I don't drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I don’t do any drugs. Mostly, I’m just… busy. Work takes up a lot of my time, and when I'm not working, I'm usually helping around the house, or spending time with my husband. It's a simple life, but I enjoy it. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Swaby, that is very helpful. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. It will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination, as well as looking in your ears and throat and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, you go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table, and let your arms relax at your sides?
PATIENT: There you are, Doctor. All ready. Please do let me know if anything feels… odd, or uncomfortable. I am a bit ticklish, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just a little bit now... Good. 2+ bilaterally. Now, let’s check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? As tight as I can? I do quite a bit of manual work, you see. Building and all sorts of things. I try to keep my hands strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. 5/5 bilaterally. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hands with your arms. Push as hard as you can, and tell me when it feels difficult. Okay, push… and stop when it gets tough. Good, 5/5 bilaterally again. Now, let's check your coordination. Could you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is this alright? I sometimes get a little bit dizzy when I close my eyes, you see. Building sites and all that, sometimes you get a bit off-balance. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's excellent. No difficulty. And now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. And finally, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is normal. Okay, Ms. Swaby, that completes the physical examination. Everything appears within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh, very good, Doctor. It all sounds rather positive, doesn't it? What do you think is causing my speech, then? Is it something serious? I do get a bit anxious about these things, you see. Work is quite stressful sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Based on the information you've provided, and the results of the physical exam, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your speech changes at this moment. However, given the gradual onset and intermittent nature, and the lack of other neurological symptoms, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be related to stress and fatigue, which can sometimes manifest as subtle speech disturbances. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. To do that, I recommend a few further tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or vitamin deficiencies. Additionally, I think an MRI of the brain would be helpful to assess for any structural abnormalities, though I don’t necessarily suspect anything significant. Finally, I'd like to refer you to a speech-language pathologist for a more thorough evaluation of your speech patterns and to rule out any underlying speech disorder. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… MRI? That sounds a bit… alarming, Doctor. Are you saying you think it might be something serious? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but I must admit, I am a bit apprehensive. What sort of things would the MRI be looking for, exactly? And how long would it take? And the speech pathologist… what would they do? I do apologise for all the questions, but I am a bit flustered now.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Swaby. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about an MRI. Let me assure you, I'm not necessarily suspecting anything serious. The MRI is simply a precautionary measure to rule out any rare but possible causes of your speech changes. It provides a very detailed image of the brain and helps us to identify any structural abnormalities, such as a small stroke, a tumor, or multiple sclerosis, though these are unlikely given your presentation. The scan itself is painless and takes about 30-45 minutes. You'll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it's important to remain still during the procedure. As for the speech-language pathologist, they will conduct a thorough assessment of your speech, including your articulation, fluency, voice, and language comprehension. They can help to identify any subtle speech disorders that might be contributing to your symptoms and recommend appropriate therapy if needed. It's a non-invasive evaluation and can provide valuable information. We can discuss the results of both tests once they are completed and develop a treatment plan based on our findings. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That does sound… more reassuring. Knowing it’s just to rule things out makes a big difference. And the speech pathologist doesn't sound too frightening, either. Alright. Let's go ahead with the tests, then. The MRI and the speech pathologist. What do I need to do next? And how long will it take to get an appointment for both? I do have work, you see, and I need to try and arrange things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll go ahead and write the orders for both tests now. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to schedule the MRI. They typically have appointments available within the next week or two. I’ll also send you a referral to a speech-language pathologist, and their office will contact you to schedule an evaluation. That usually takes a bit longer, perhaps a month or so, due to their waitlist. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and noting any changes or triggers. If you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, dizziness, vision changes, or severe headache, please seek immediate medical attention. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the orders for the tests. And finally, I will send a note to your primary care physician to inform them of our findings and the plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. A written summary will be very helpful, thank you. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing we’re getting it checked out. I’ll keep an eye on things and call if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Soodeen. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch once the test results are available. And Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Try not to worry too much. Stress can sometimes exacerbate these things. And remember, we're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you for a follow-up appointment once we have the results.
