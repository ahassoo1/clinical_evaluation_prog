DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness lab panel, if that’s correct? I just turned seventy-four, you see, and my wife, Elena, insisted I get a thorough check-up. She worries so, that woman! But a good woman, a very good woman. I thought it best to be proactive, you understand. Just want to make sure everything is still…functioning as it should.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you scheduled a comprehensive wellness panel. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though frankly, most people at your age should already be doing this regularly. Your wife sounds…attentive. Now, before we get to the bloodwork results, let's go over a bit of your history. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Doctor Ramirez, over on Elm Street. A very capable woman. I've been with her for…oh, fifteen years now, perhaps longer. We mostly discuss my blood pressure, it tends to run a little high sometimes, and my knees, of course. The knees! Construction work isn’t kind to the joints, you know. I’ve been a laborer my whole life, building homes, mostly. Still do a bit when I can, though Elena frowns upon it. She worries about me falling. Is it necessary to have Doctor Ramirez’s records sent over, do you think?
DOCTOR: It would be ideal, Mr. Mombrun, to have those records. Avoids duplication of effort, you understand. Though, frankly, I'm sure it'll be the usual litany of age-related complaints. Still, for the sake of thoroughness…yes, please have them sent over. Do you know if Doctor Ramirez's office has a fax number or electronic exchange capability?
PATIENT: Yes, they do! They’ve gotten quite modern, actually. Let me see… Here it is. The fax number is 555-123-4567, and they also use a secure electronic system, if that’s preferred. It’s called “HealthLink,” I believe. Elena handles most of that sort of thing, but I know she’s set it up. She’s very tech-savvy, that woman. A real marvel. Is HealthLink better, do you think? I wouldn't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: HealthLink is…acceptable. More efficient than a fax, certainly. I’ll have my assistant send a request through the system. Now, while we’re waiting for those records, let’s talk about you. Beyond blood pressure and knees, any other significant medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bout of shingles a few years back, quite painful, but it cleared up completely. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as you can see. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy, I think. A few aches and pains, what do you expect at my age? I try to stay active, walk every morning with Elena, eat a reasonably healthy diet. She’s very good at keeping me in line, that woman! Always making sure I get my fruits and vegetables. I suppose she thinks of me as a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Shingles. Noted. And the daily walks are…commendable, though I suspect the benefit is largely psychological. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I haven’t taken many medications over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees when they really flare up. I usually use ibuprofen, but nothing regularly. I prefer to tough it out, if I can. I don't like relying on pills, you see. Doctor Ramirez has always been careful to check, of course, before prescribing anything. She's a very thorough woman. I can’t recall ever having a reaction to anything, honestly. Not even as a child.
DOCTOR: Good. Ibuprofen, noted. Let's move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, sadly not. My father passed away when I was quite young, a heart condition, I believe. My mother lived to a good age, eighty-nine, but she had diabetes. And my older brother, Ricardo, he suffered a stroke about ten years ago. He’s… not doing well. Lives in a care facility now, unfortunately. It’s very sad. Elena visits him whenever she can. She has a very kind heart, that woman. Always thinking of others. As for other relatives…there were many of us, a large family. I wouldn’t be able to recall all their medical histories, truthfully. It was a long time ago, and a lot of people.
DOCTOR: Heart condition and diabetes. Noted. Family history is… predictably unhelpful. Now, briefly, what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Well, I don't go out much these days. Mostly just spend time with Elena. We enjoy watching television, reading, and going for our walks. I used to enjoy fishing, but my knees… well, you know. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back considerably. Elena prefers I didn’t, and she’s right, of course. It's better for my health. I don't smoke, never have. And I certainly don't partake in any… illicit activities. I'm a simple man, Doctor. A quiet life with my wife is all I need.
DOCTOR: A “simple life.” Right. And, to be absolutely clear, no recreational drug use whatsoever?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! No, sir! Never. I've always believed in living a clean and honest life. I have no interest in such things. I was raised with strong values, you see. My parents instilled in me the importance of hard work, honesty, and respect. Elena would never allow it, either! She has a very strong moral compass, that woman. I assure you, Doctor, I'm as clean as a whistle. Is there a reason you ask? I hope I haven't offended you.
DOCTOR: No, you haven’t offended me, Mr. Mombrun. Just… covering all bases. Now. Let’s get to the physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes. Perhaps you could hold my arm, just in case? Elena always insists I have assistance. She worries so, that woman! But a good woman, a very good woman.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms. Height is 193 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… well, let’s just say it’s not optimal. Now, I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. 90 kilograms, you say? Perhaps I've been enjoying Elena's cooking too much. She makes a wonderful arepa, you see, and I can never resist a second helping. She insists it’s good for my soul! I'll try to relax, but my knees sometimes ache when I lie flat. I hope that won’t interfere with your examination.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but there’s a faint murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A murmur, you say? I've never been told about a murmur before. Is that something serious? My father, as I mentioned, had a heart condition… I do hope it’s nothing to worry about. As for my lungs, I sometimes feel a little breathless when I climb stairs, but I attributed that to my age and weight. I try not to worry about these things, but Elena… well, she worries enough for both of us. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Slightly diminished in the lower extremities, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I need to take a look at your knees. Please bend them for me. And try not to groan. It's distracting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Oh, dear… that’s not a comfortable position. I warned you, my knees aren’t what they used to be. Years of construction work, you see. Building homes, carrying heavy loads… it takes a toll on the body. I’ve tried various creams and ointments, but nothing seems to provide lasting relief. Elena suggested physical therapy, but I’m reluctant to go. I don’t like being fussed over. Please, be gentle. They’re rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Crepitus present bilaterally. Mild swelling, consistent with osteoarthritis. Range of motion is limited. As expected. Osteoarthritis. Common in your age group, especially with a history of manual labor. Now, let's review the results of your bloodwork. Your cholesterol is elevated, and your glucose is slightly above normal. Not diabetic yet, but pre-diabetic. You need to make some lifestyle changes, Mr. Mombrun. And quickly.
PATIENT: Elevated cholesterol and pre-diabetic, you say? Oh, dear. That’s not good news, is it? I suspected as much, to be honest. I’ve been enjoying Elena’s cooking a little too much, as I mentioned. She makes wonderful empanadas, you see, and I can never resist a second helping. Lifestyle changes… what exactly does that entail, Doctor? I’m willing to make an effort, of course, but I’m not sure where to begin. Elena will be pleased to hear you say something, she's been nagging me about my diet for years! Perhaps we could start with cutting back on the empanadas? But that might cause a domestic dispute.
DOCTOR: It entails a strict diet, regular exercise, and possibly medication. We need to get your cholesterol under control to prevent a heart attack or stroke. And the pre-diabetes… that needs to be addressed immediately to prevent developing full-blown diabetes. Cutting back on the empanadas is a start, but it's not enough. You need to eliminate processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive carbohydrates. Focus on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. I'm going to prescribe a statin to lower your cholesterol, and I want you to schedule an appointment with a registered dietitian to develop a meal plan. And I want to see you back here in three months for a follow-up blood test. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A statin, a registered dietitian… It seems rather… drastic, Doctor. I’ve never taken medication before, and I’m not sure I’m ready to overhaul my entire diet. I enjoy my food, you see, and I’m a simple man. I don’t like complicated things. Elena will be pleased, of course, she's been wanting me to get healthier for years. But I’m worried about giving up my favorite foods. And I’m not sure I have the energy to exercise for 30 minutes every day. Perhaps we could start slowly? Maybe just cutting back on the empanadas and taking a short walk every other day? Is that possible, Doctor? I want to cooperate, but I’m a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Mombrun, with all due respect, you are pre-diabetic with elevated cholesterol. This is not a situation to be taken lightly. “Starting slowly” is not going to cut it. You need to make significant changes now to prevent serious health complications. I understand that it's not easy, but your health is at stake. I am prescribing the statin, and I expect you to take it as directed. I am also referring you to a registered dietitian who will develop a meal plan specifically tailored to your needs. And I expect you to follow that plan. I will also schedule you for a follow-up appointment in three months to monitor your progress. If you do not make significant improvements, we will discuss other options. Do you have any further questions, or are we clear?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe that’s the best course of action… I’ll cooperate. I’ll take the statin, and I’ll see the registered dietitian. But please, be patient with me. I’m a simple man, as I’ve said, and I’m not used to complicated things. Elena will be pleased, of course, she's been wanting me to get healthier for years. But I’m worried about giving up my favorite foods. And I’m not sure I have the energy to exercise for 30 minutes every day. Perhaps the registered dietitian can suggest some healthy alternatives to my favorite foods? And perhaps we can start with a shorter exercise routine? I trust your judgment, Doctor. But please, be gentle with me. This is all rather overwhelming. Now, about those empanadas… is there any room for negotiation?
DOCTOR: Negotiation?
