DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My... how you say... the place for old people? My family want me to go live there. They say I need paper from doctor first. For... checking? To make sure I am okay for there.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay. So, a medical evaluation for potential placement in a… assisted living facility, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Assisted... that is it! To live there. My husband, he think is good. But I want to make sure I can still... walk around? And do things? I don't want to just... sit.
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to ensure you maintain your independence and ability to move around freely. That's very reasonable. Let's start with a bit more detail about how you're feeling right now. Are you experiencing any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes my knees. They hurt when I go up stairs. And my back, a little, after I stand for long time. But is okay. Old age, you know? Is normal. Not bad pain, just... there.
DOCTOR: Right, knees and back discomfort. And how about your breathing?
PATIENT: I get... short of breath. When I walk very fast. Or when I am... excited. My daughter say I should not get so excited, but is hard! I like to talk! Is just... a little puff, then okay. Not always.
DOCTOR: A little puff of breath with exertion or excitement. Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes. At the end of day. My shoes feel... tight. But I put my feet up, and it go down. Is not every day, you know? Just... when is hot. Or I eat too much salt. My husband, he likes salt!
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles, worse with heat or salt intake. Alright. Let’s talk about other things. Have you been having any chest pain, or palpitations – that’s when your heart feels like it’s racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Heart is... okay. Maybe a little fast sometimes when I worry. But not pain. My doctor before, he say my heart is strong. He listen with the... the thing. The cold thing he put on my chest? He say good.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, heart feels strong. Good. Now, have you been having any problems with your memory lately?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes I forget things. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses! But who doesn't? My daughter worry about it, but I think is just... getting old. I remember important things. Like my husband's birthday! And how to make my special rice.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's normal to have some memory lapses as we age. Now, let’s talk about your bowel movements and bladder function. Have you noticed any changes in those areas recently?
PATIENT: Oh. That... Is... okay. Sometimes a little hard. I drink a lot of water. And sometimes I go more than before. But is not... a problem, really. Just old lady things, I think. My husband, he always tell me to drink more water.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Now, have you had any falls recently, or do you feel unsteady on your feet?
PATIENT: No falls. But I feel… a little dizzy sometimes. When I stand up too fast. I hold on to things. The counter, the chair. But I haven't fall. Not yet. My daughter, she buy me a cane. But I don't like to use it. I feel too old with the cane.
DOCTOR: I see. Dizziness with standing. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, and see how your joints are doing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Okay. What do you want me to do? Is like before? With the cold thing? I am ready. Just... no needles, please. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope – yes, the cold thing. Then I'll check your joints and your reflexes. Can you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Straight. Is cold in here, a little. But is okay. Do it quickly, please. My husband is waiting in the car. He doesn't like to wait long.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not new, likely benign, but we'll note it. Now, your lungs… Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Let's check your knees… Some mild tenderness and crepitus in both knees. Consistent with osteoarthritis. Now your ankles… Mild swelling noted, as you mentioned. And lastly, I'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad? The knees? They always hurt. And my back. Is everything okay? My daughter, she worry so much. Is the murmur... dangerous?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. The knee and back pain are consistent with age-related wear and tear, nothing acutely concerning. The murmur is a common finding in older adults and, based on what I’m hearing, doesn’t sound like anything to be overly worried about right now. However, to get a better picture of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for any underlying anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Is that... a lot of tests? Will they hurt? My husband, he doesn't like me to go to the hospital. He say is full of germs. And I don't want to be poked and prodded. Can't we just... say I am okay? For the place? Is just to live there. Not for surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. You're right, it’s not surgery, and it’s not about saying you're not okay. It's about gathering information to ensure you’re as safe and healthy as possible in your new living situation. The tests are relatively simple – a blood draw and a quick X-ray. We can minimize the time you spend at the hospital, and they take precautions to prevent infection. If we can get these results, it will give the assisted living facility more confidence in your care, and it will allow them to tailor a plan to meet your specific needs. If you're still very reluctant, we could potentially proceed without the tests, but it would mean I have less information, and I’d be less able to advocate for your specific care needs. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My husband will be angry. He hate the hospital. But... you say is for my care? To make sure they know what to do? Okay. But quickly, please. And no needles if you can help it. Just... the X-ray. And you promise is safe? Is not full of germs?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. We will do the chest X-ray and blood draw. I will personally ensure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. The lab and radiology departments take strict hygiene precautions to minimize the risk of infection. We'll do everything we can to make it a safe and efficient process. I will write the orders for the tests now. And I'll have the receptionist schedule them for you as soon as possible. We can discuss the results when they come back, and then we can talk about what they mean for your care. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sound okay. But... can I at least sit down for the blood draw? I don't like to lie down. And tell them to be gentle. My veins... they are old.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can absolutely sit down for the blood draw. And I will make a note to the lab technician to be extra gentle, as you mentioned your veins are delicate. I will also let them know you prefer to sit. Is there anything else I can do to make you feel more comfortable during the process?
PATIENT: No, I think is okay. Just... hurry, please. And be gentle. My husband is waiting. And he gets... impatient. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’ll get the orders to the receptionist right away. And I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make this as quick and easy as possible. We’ll get you back to your husband soon.
