DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to put it simply, I'm just awfully tired during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It’s…frustrating, you know? I thought the machine was supposed to fix all this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It is frustrating when something isn’t working as expected. Sleep apnea machines are very helpful for many, but sometimes… adjustments need to be made, or there may be other things going on. So, you’re feeling tired despite using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Despite it. I use it every single night, like a good patient should. I make sure the mask is fitted properly, and I clean it regularly. But I still find myself dozing off in the afternoons… sometimes even while I’m reading! It’s not a good feeling, and it makes me worry about, well, everything really. I want to be sharp, you know? I still teach a class at the community college a couple of times a week.
DOCTOR: Right, teaching keeps you engaged, that’s important. Okay. And how long has this daytime sleepiness been happening despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It's been… about three months, I'd say. Maybe a little longer. I started using the machine in February, and for the first couple of months, I felt fantastic. A real difference. But then, gradually, the tiredness crept back in. It wasn't sudden, just…slow. Now it's definitely noticeable, and it's starting to bother me quite a bit. I really don’t want to have to give up teaching.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you remembering to use the machine every night?
PATIENT: Doctor, you wound me! Of course, I am. I said I’m a good patient, didn’t I? Honestly, I haven’t missed a night since I got it. I keep a little logbook, actually, just to be sure. It’s right here in my bag if you want to see it. It’s a habit, you know, keeping track of things. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s excellent. It's always helpful to know that things are being used consistently. Let's see… do you notice any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Well, my wife – we’re divorced now, but we still talk – she used to say I snored a bit, even with the machine on. Not terribly loud, but she could hear it. And sometimes I wake up with a bit of a dry mouth, even though I use a humidifier with it. Also, I find I have to go to the bathroom more often at night than I used to. Does that sound… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those things could be relevant. The snoring… sometimes the machine doesn't completely eliminate it. Dry mouth is common, and frequent urination… that’s good information. Now, tell me a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I had my prostate removed about ten years ago now, so I have to see a specialist for that regularly. Other than that…the doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a bit high, so I've been trying to eat better, mostly salads and fish. Oh, and my knees are giving me trouble, getting older, you know? Arthritis, I think. But nothing major, really. No diabetes or anything like that. I get a check-up every year, and the doctor usually says I’m doing pretty well for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, prostate surgery, high cholesterol, and arthritis… good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. For my cholesterol, I take a statin – atorvastatin, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they’re really bothering me. Also, the doctor put me on a medication a few years back to help with an overactive bladder, since the surgery. It’s called… tolterodine, I believe. I can get you the full list if you need it, I have it written down at home. I try to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. We can verify all of this with your records, but it’s good you're keeping track. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not anymore. I used to smoke, years ago, when I was in the army. But I gave that up a long time ago. And I rarely drink. A glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a month, if that. I mostly drink water. I like a nice, cold glass of water, actually. It's better for you, you know? And I try to stay active, walking a little bit every day. Not much, but enough to keep me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol. That’s good. And now, just to get a better idea of things, are there any allergies we should be aware of – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no allergies to medications. I’ve had a few mosquito bites over the years, but nothing serious! I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. Though this tiredness is starting to make me wonder about that luck, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is concerning when things change. Alright, Mr. Paske, before we proceed, I'd like to take a quick look at your heart, lungs, and take your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment completely. I’m just hoping we can figure out what's going on with this tiredness. It's really starting to affect my teaching.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and a quick neurological exam.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A little elevated, you say? Is that something I should be worried about? My father had high blood pressure, so maybe it runs in the family. I’m happy to have the neurological exam. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. My students need me, you know? It’s hard to explain history when you’re fighting to stay awake.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. Balance is a little unsteady, but that could be age-related. Okay, Mr. Paske, everything seems relatively normal so far. The elevated blood pressure and slight heart sounds warrant some further investigation. Given your history of sleep apnea, the tiredness, and your other symptoms, I think it's important to rule out a few things. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. Also, I'm going to recommend a repeat sleep study, just to see if your machine settings still need adjustment.
PATIENT: That all sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work and another sleep study…yes, that seems sensible. I'm happy to do whatever it takes. Vitamin D… I don’t get out in the sun much, so I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s low. Hopefully, we can get some answers soon. I really appreciate your time, and your attention to detail. It makes me feel a lot better knowing someone is taking this seriously. When should I expect the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I can help. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. The sleep study scheduling will take a bit longer, depending on availability at the center. My nurse, Sarah, will call you with the details for both once they're arranged. In the meantime, if your tiredness gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath, please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. We'll also need to revisit your blood pressure medication if it remains elevated after the bloodwork. In the interim, I'd like you to continue using your machine as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Sarah calling me with the details sounds perfect. And thank you again for taking the time to listen, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's easy to be told you're just getting old, you know? But I still have a lot of life left in me, and a lot of students to teach. So, thank you. I’ll wait for Sarah’s call. And I’ll keep you informed if anything changes. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything at all comes up. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm hopeful we can get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, and have a good day. .
