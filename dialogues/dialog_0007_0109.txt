DOCTOR: Good morning, Mitchell. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but comes and goes. Feels like… a pressure. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say. Not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… a heavy feeling. Like I been wearing a hat that’s too tight. Sometimes it feels… warm back there too. And I get… a little dizzy sometimes when it’s bad. Not fall-down dizzy, just… things spin a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A heavy, tight feeling with some warmth and occasional dizziness. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, resting helps. If I lie down, it’s not so bad. But… working. Working makes it worse. I still gotta work, you know? Gotta pay the bills. I work with the trains… out at the rail yard. Lots of… moving around, loud noises, and… thinking about keeping things safe. That seems to make it worse. And… sun. Bright sun. Makes it feel… worse too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting improves it, working and bright sun worsen it. And you work with the trains, which involves physical activity and concentration. Do you have any trouble with your vision, Mitchell?
PATIENT: Vision? Not really. A little blurry sometimes, but I always have. Old age, I guess. I got glasses, like you see. They help. I can see alright. Nothing new with my eyes, no. Not that I noticed. Everything… pretty much the same, vision-wise.
DOCTOR: Alright, vision seems stable. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this headache?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And no… throwing up. Not sick to my stomach either. Just… the headache. And a little tired, maybe. But I’m ninety years old! I am supposed to be a little tired. It’s not like a flu, Doctor. Just… this head pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Just the headache and some fatigue, which is understandable. Now, have you ever had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. I’ve had headaches before, sure. But… not exactly like this. Usually, it’s just a little pain all over. This feels… different. More focused on the back of my head. And the dizziness… haven’t had dizziness with headaches before. Maybe… once or twice a long time ago, but I don’t remember. Old man, you know? Memory isn't what it used to be. But this feels… new. Definitely new.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new type of headache for you. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I got a little… arthritis in my knees. Makes walking a bit hard sometimes. And my blood pressure… the doctor told me it’s a little high, a long time ago. But I don’t take any medicine for it. Didn’t seem worth it. Just gotta take it easy, he said. And… that’s about it. Nothing else. I been pretty lucky, all things considered. I work hard, eat okay, and try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees and a history of high blood pressure, but not currently managed with medication. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long, long time ago. And… oh! I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. But that was… sixty years ago? They fixed it, good as new. No other surgeries, no. Just those two. Everything else… just bumps and bruises from working with the trains.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a broken arm in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I don’t like taking pills. They just make me feel… funny. I try to avoid them if I can. Just a little bit of coffee in the morning, that's all. And maybe a little bit of aspirin if I got a really bad ache, but not often. Very, very rarely. I try to let things heal on their own, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem with… food, or anything like that. And no reaction to any medicine when I had to take something. I don't remember ever having a bad reaction to anything, no. I’m pretty lucky, like I said. Maybe I got good genes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Do you have any family history of headaches, high blood pressure, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a tricky one. My mother… she got headaches sometimes. But nothing like this, she just complained a bit. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He died young, from a heart attack. And… my sister, she had a little trouble with her memory when she got old, but that’s about it. No one else… not that I remember. It’s been a long time, you know? Lots of family… gone now. It's hard to remember everything. But no one with… really bad headaches, no. And no one with trouble walking or… anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a drop. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And no alcohol. My wife… she didn't like it, and I loved my wife. So I didn't drink. And… recreational drugs? An old man like me? No, no. I got no time for that. Just work, and family, and trying to stay healthy. That's all. I’m a simple man, Doctor. A very simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. Thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It shouldn’t take long. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need. Sit up, check... whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just tell me if it’s going to hurt, okay? Old bones, you know. They don’t move like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be gentle. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 162 over 98. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear, although the sounds are a little quieter than usual. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow it. Like this? I'm trying my best. My eyes... they get tired sometimes. It's like they don't move as quick as they used to. But I can see it. I can follow it. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too hard? I don't want to hurt you, Doctor. My hands... they aren't as strong as they used to be. Working with the trains, it’s hard work, but it’s not like it used to be. Lots of buttons and levers now, not so much lifting and pulling. Is that good? Is that too weak?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, I’m going to check your gait – how you walk. Would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Slow and easy… Gotta be careful. Old knees, you know. They creak a bit. Is that okay? Am I walking alright? I don’t want to fall, Doctor. It's been a while since I walked without someone holding my arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. Thank you. . Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, your blood pressure is elevated, and you have some mild weakness and a slightly unsteady gait. The headache is new, and the dizziness is concerning, especially with your age and blood pressure. While it could be a tension headache, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm concerned about a possible transient ischemic attack, or TIA, sometimes called a "mini-stroke," or a more serious stroke. The symptoms you described – headache, dizziness, and mild weakness – could be related to this. To be safe, I want to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any bleeding or other abnormalities. I also want to do some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any infection or other problems. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: A scan? And… blood tests? What does that mean, Doctor? A “mini-stroke?” Is that… serious? I just got a headache… I don't want no scans or… needles. I don’t like hospitals. Is it really necessary? Maybe it’s just… old age? Maybe I just need some rest? I don't want to be sick, Doctor. I just want my head to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mitchell. It is scary to hear those words. A TIA is a warning sign, a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain. It doesn’t always cause permanent damage, but it can be a sign of a future, more serious stroke. That’s why we need to find out what’s causing it. The scan is a quick, painless way to look at your brain and rule out any bleeding or other problems. The blood tests will give us more information about your overall health. I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously, and we're going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were important. While it might be just old age, we need to rule out something more serious. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your brain. Do you have any family who can come with you to the hospital for the scan and blood tests?
PATIENT: Family… my son, Ricardo… he lives a little ways away. But he’s busy with work… always busy. He could come, I suppose, but he doesn't like hospitals either. He gets worried easily. A scan… and needles… I don't like the sound of that. But… you think it's important? You think it could be something bad? Okay… okay, I guess I'll do it. But please… be gentle. And please, tell me what's going on. I want to know. I don't want to be kept in the dark. Just tell me… what are we looking for? And what happens if… if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you trusting me, Mitchell. Yes, I will explain everything as clearly as possible, and I promise to be gentle. The scan will help us see if there’s any bleeding in your brain, any blockages in the blood vessels, or any other abnormalities. The blood tests will check for things like infection, dehydration, and any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. If it is a TIA or stroke, early treatment can significantly reduce the risk of further complications and help you recover. Treatment options might include medication to thin your blood, medication to lower your blood pressure, or, in some cases, more intensive care. We'll discuss all of the options with you in detail if we find anything concerning. For now, I’m going to write an order for the CT scan and blood tests. We'll get you over to the imaging department and the lab as soon as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the process. I’ll also have the nurse get Ricardo’s number and let him know what's going on. Do you have any questions for me right now before we get started?
PATIENT: Just… how long will this take? I don’t want to be stuck in the hospital all day. And… will it hurt? The scan and the needles? I’m afraid of needles, Doctor. Always have been. And… What if… what if it is something bad? Will I… will I be okay? Will I still be… me? I don't want to lose my memory, Doctor. I just want my head to stop hurting. And I want to go home. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Those are all very understandable concerns, Mitchell. Let's take them one at a time. The CT scan itself is quick – usually only a few minutes. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will rotate around you to take images. It doesn't hurt at all, although it can be a little noisy and you'll need to lie very still. The blood draw will be a little pinch, but it's over quickly. I'll ask the nurse to be as gentle as possible, and she's very experienced. She can also use a numbing cream if you'd like. And about whether you’ll be okay… that’s the most important question. It’s too early to say for sure what’s going on. We need the results of the tests to know that. But even if it is something serious, we have treatments available to help you recover. We'll work with you every step of the way to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Losing your memory is a valid concern, and we’ll address that specifically if it becomes an issue. The good news is, many people recover fully or partially from strokes and TIAs. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can start a treatment plan, if necessary. I’ll stay with you as long as you need me. And I’ll make sure Ricardo is kept informed. Are you ready for me to call the nurse?
PATIENT: …Okay. Yes. Call the nurse. But… please. Be gentle. And… tell me what’s happening. Every step of the way. I don't want to be surprised. I just want to know. And… please, remember my name. Mitchell Brum. Don't let me be just another number.
DOCTOR: I will absolutely remember your name, Mitchell. Mitchell Brum. And I promise to explain every step of the process and answer any questions you have along the way. You're not just a number to me, and your concerns are my priority. Nurse, could you please come in here?
