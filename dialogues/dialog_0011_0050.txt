DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Pavlovec, yes. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… tickles and then… hack. Not much comes up, though. Just air, mostly. It’s bothersome, that’s for sure. I don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s perfectly alright if dates are difficult to recall. We’ll take our time. So, this dry cough has been ongoing for a while. You mentioned it’s mostly air when you cough. Has anything, to your knowledge, made it worse – perhaps certain times of day, being in a particular room, or any activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… It seems worse in the mornings, usually. When I first wake up. And… maybe when I’m doing things around the house? Dust, maybe? I do a little bit of fixing, you know. Old things. Not much anymore, though. My hands aren’t what they used to be. But… dust could be it. I don’t know for sure. It just… feels worse then.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Pavlovec. So, mornings are worse, and possibly activity that stirs up dust. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well… I get tired easily, I suppose. But at my age, isn’t that to be expected? It’s hard to say what's from the cough and what’s just… old age. I haven’t been running any fevers, if that’s what you’re asking. And… no, no shortness of breath. Just tired. And this cough. Mostly the cough. I don’t think anything else… really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no shortness of breath, just increased fatigue alongside the cough. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I remember… being a pretty healthy young man. Worked hard, always outside. I had… something with my lungs, a long time ago. When I was… maybe in my thirties? It wasn’t serious, they said. Just… something I had to get over. I don’t recall the name of it. And… my wife, she handled all the doctor appointments. I just… did what she told me. It’s been a long time. I don’t really remember much else, honestly. Just the usual aches and pains that come with a long life, I suppose. Nothing major… that I remember.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s common for details to become less clear over time. You mentioned something with your lungs in your thirties. Do you recall if it required hospitalization, or any long-term treatment?
PATIENT: Hospitalization… hmm… I think… maybe for a few days. But it was a long time ago. A small hospital, out near… well, it doesn’t matter now, it’s gone. They gave me some medicine, and I got better. That’s all I really remember. Not long-term treatment, no. Just… a few days in the hospital, and then I was able to go back to work. It wasn’t anything… serious, like I said. Just a bit of a scare, I think. My wife, bless her soul, she worried a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovec. A brief hospitalization for a lung issue in your thirties. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or had any other significant illnesses or injuries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… oh, I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. Fixing the roof, if I remember correctly. That was a long time ago, too. And… that’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with a long life. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’ve never had anything… serious, like cancer or heart trouble. Nothing like that. Just… old age catching up with me, I suppose. Mostly this cough, now.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken arm in the past. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that's a tricky one. My wife’s family, they lived a long time. She had a mother who lived into her nineties, I think. But I didn’t know them well. My side… well, my parents, they both passed when I was young. And I had… brothers and sisters, but we didn’t keep in touch much. We moved around a lot, you see. It’s hard to remember. I don’t recall anyone having any… serious illnesses, like heart trouble or cancer. But honestly, I don't really know. I didn't pay much attention to that sort of thing. Just trying to make a living, you see. It wasn’t something I thought about much. I'm sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s understandable that details aren't always clear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, it’s quiet. I live alone now, my wife’s been gone for… oh, it must be ten years now. I mostly stay at home. I used to do a little bit of gardening, but my hands aren’t what they used to be. I like to watch television, and listen to the radio. I don’t… go out much anymore. And I certainly don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little bit of beer, but not much these days. Just trying to take it easy, you see. It's a simple life. Not very exciting, but… peaceful. And I eat… well, whatever's easy to prepare. Soup, mostly. And toast. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovec. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s another thing I don’t really remember. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything, that I recall. My wife always handled my medicine, and she would have known. I don't think I'm allergic to any food, no. I eat pretty much everything. But honestly, Doctor, I can’t say for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It's probably best to just… be careful, I suppose. Start with a small dose, if you have to give me anything. That's what my wife would have said, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, but a recommendation to proceed with caution. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s… a good question. Let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a while ago. Said it was getting too low. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my hands are really bad. But… that’s about it, I think. Just the arthritis medicine sometimes. It’s… over the counter, I believe. I can't remember the name of it. It’s a little white pill. I get it at the drugstore. I don't take it every day. Only when I need it. And that’s about all, I think. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovec. So, you previously took medication for blood pressure, but are currently only taking an over-the-counter medication for arthritis as needed. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate and blood pressure, and a general look at your overall condition. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovec. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your lungs now. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again… deep breath in… and out… I’m hearing some mild wheezing on both sides, but nothing alarming at this point. Now, I’ll listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Blood pressure is 110 over 70, pulse is 72. Your chest is clear to palpation, no tenderness. You appear generally well, but slightly frail. Skin is dry, but no visible rashes or lesions. Alright, Mr. Pavlovec. I’ve completed the exam. As I mentioned, I heard some mild wheezing in your lungs and your heart sounds are a bit faint. Considering your age, your history of a lung issue, and your current cough, I would like to order a chest x-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest x-ray… Oh dear. Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? I haven't had one of those in… well, I don't even remember. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes. Yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please tell me what it shows, okay? I don't like surprises. It’s just… I’m an old man, Doctor. I don't want any… bad news. But if it will help, then yes, please do the x-ray.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious. A chest x-ray is a standard imaging test that allows us to visualize your lungs and heart. It doesn’t involve any radiation that would be harmful, and it will give me a better understanding of the cause of your cough and the mild wheezing I heard. It’s a precautionary measure, and doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything serious wrong. We will schedule the x-ray at the imaging center across the street. Once the results are available, we will review them together, and I will explain everything to you in detail. I will also want to discuss a possible trial of an inhaler to help with the wheezing, even before we have the x-ray results. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… hmm. Well, if you think it will help… yes, alright. Try an inhaler. I’ve never used one before, but… if you think it will ease my breathing, then yes. Let's try it. And the x-ray… across the street, you say? That’s good, convenient. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I get tired easily, you see. But yes, let's do it. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain everything to me afterwards, okay? I don’t want any surprises. I’m an old man, and I like things… simple.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovec. I will explain everything in detail, and we will keep things as simple as possible. The x-ray should only take a few minutes, and they will assist you if you need help. I’m going to write an order for the chest x-ray and a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler – Albuterol. It’s a common medication used to open up the airways in your lungs. The nursing staff will provide instructions on how to use it before you leave. We will also schedule a follow-up appointment for one week after your x-ray, so we can discuss the results and see how you are responding to the inhaler. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One week… yes, that sounds alright. So, an x-ray across the street, then a follow-up appointment in one week… and this inhaler. I think I can remember that. Just… please, Doctor. Don’t tell me anything too frightening, okay? I’m an old man, and I’ve had a long life. I just want to… be comfortable. But… thank you. Thank you for taking care of me. I appreciate it. And… tell me, is this covered by… anything? I don't have much money, you see. I haven’t insured myself in a long time. It's just… things are tight. But thank you. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. I understand your concerns completely. I assure you, I will explain everything clearly and honestly, and I will do my best to keep things as straightforward as possible. Regarding cost, let me check on the pricing for the x-ray. Unfortunately, because you are uninsured, it will be a cash price. The cash price for the chest x-ray is $150. I also want to connect you with our social worker who can explore potential assistance programs for patients without insurance. Would you like me to arrange a meeting with her before you leave today?
PATIENT: $150… Oh dear. That’s… a bit more than I have right now. I can probably manage it, but it will be tight. Very tight. A social worker… yes, please. Yes, that would be wonderful. If she can help me with the cost… that would be a great relief. Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. You're very kind, Doctor. Very kind indeed. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. I’m just an old man, and I’ve lived a long life. But… thank you. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden at all, Mr. Pavlovec. We are here to help in any way we can. I've put in a request for the social worker, Ms. Evelyn Reed, to meet with you before you leave. She will be able to discuss your options and see if you qualify for any financial assistance programs. She’s very helpful. For now, let’s focus on getting you scheduled for that x-ray and making sure you understand how to use the inhaler. The nursing staff will be in shortly to give you the instructions. Do you have any questions for me right now before they arrive?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. The inhaler… and the x-ray… and Ms. Reed. I think I can remember that. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with an old man. And… thank you for not judging me. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, and I was worried you would be… annoyed. But you’ve been very kind. Just… thank you. I think I’ll just sit here for a moment and… try to relax before the nurse comes. But… thank you. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. It was my pleasure meeting you. Take your time to relax, and the nurse will be with you shortly. Don’t hesitate to ask any questions you may have, even if they seem small. We'll take good care of you.
