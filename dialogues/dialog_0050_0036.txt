DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the practice. I’m Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. It is… required, yes? My friend told me I need this before Medicare will… cover things. I do not know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A “check-up” for insurance purposes. Yes, I am familiar with the process. It’s often referred to as an initial preventative exam. While commendable that you are taking this step, I assure you, Mr. Barban, a thorough medical evaluation is always advisable, regardless of insurance stipulations. Now, let’s move beyond the administrative aspect. To provide you with the most appropriate care – and to satisfy the requirements of Medicare, naturally – I need to gather some detailed information. Let’s begin with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No, never. I am a healthy man. I work hard. Food processing, you understand. It is… physical work. Perhaps a cold sometimes, but nothing serious. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach. Old age, I think. But that is her, not me. I do not get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. It's good to hear you maintain good health, despite the demands of your profession. However, simply stating you are “healthy” isn't sufficient for a proper assessment. A family history of gastrointestinal issues is relevant, Mr. Barban, regardless of whether you personally experience symptoms. Could you elaborate on your mother’s “problems”?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. She… complained a lot. Stomach pain. Always stomach pain. The doctors in Yemen… they gave her some medicine, but it did not help much. She was old. Very old. They said… something about ulcers, maybe? I do not remember the exact words. It was a long time ago. She is… gone now, of course. It is not important. I do not have stomach problems.
DOCTOR: While her passing is undoubtedly sad, Mr. Barban, information regarding her condition is important. “Complaining a lot” is rather vague. Did she experience any specific symptoms beyond pain – nausea, vomiting, weight loss, changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? Doctor, I do not discuss such things with strangers. It is… personal. She was an old woman with old woman problems. She ate strange things sometimes, maybe that is why. She liked… very spicy food. I do not know. I told you, I do not have these problems. I eat normal food. Meat, rice, vegetables. Nothing fancy. Can we move on? This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I assure you, these questions are not posed out of mere curiosity. They are essential for a comprehensive medical evaluation. Dismissing potentially relevant information simply because it is “uncomfortable” is…unwise. A family history of gastrointestinal issues, particularly if accompanied by specific symptoms, warrants further investigation. However, if you are truly unwilling to provide any details, we can proceed, though the quality of the assessment will inevitably be compromised. Before we do, let's discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I have never had a problem with food. Maybe… a little bit of dust sometimes. But who does not get dusty? It is a dry country, Yemen. Not like here. I do not take medicine unless I am very sick, and then my friend gives me something. I do not go to doctors, normally. This is for the insurance, remember?
DOCTOR: "A little bit of dust" could indicate a mild respiratory allergy, Mr. Barban, but I shall note your denial of significant allergies. It’s… regrettable that you prioritize avoiding discomfort over providing comprehensive medical information. Now, let’s briefly touch upon your current medications. You mentioned your friend provides you with something when you are ill. Could you specify what that “something” is?
PATIENT: It is… a pill. White pill. Small. He gets it from… someone. I do not know the name. He says it is good for everything. Headache, stomach ache, fever. I take it when I need it. Not often, thankfully. I do not like taking pills. It is better to rest, you know? But sometimes… I need it. He is a good friend. He knows things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, accepting medication from an unknown source is highly inadvisable and potentially dangerous. You have no way of knowing the pill’s composition, dosage, or potential side effects. This is not merely a matter of preference; it is a serious health risk. Before we proceed further, I must strongly advise you to cease taking this unregulated medication immediately. Now, let us perform a brief physical examination. I will begin by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Shoes and socks? Very well. But I still do not understand why this pill is so important to you. It has always worked for me. Yemen is a poor country, Doctor. We do not have fancy doctors and pills like here. I take care of myself. But fine, you want to check, check. Just be quick, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: 145/90. Slightly elevated, Mr. Barban, but not alarming given your apparent reluctance to provide a complete medical history. 82, regular. Lungs are clear, but I detect a slight wheeze on auscultation. 98.6 Fahrenheit. The wheezing, combined with your history of occasional dust exposure, suggests a possibility of mild asthma, or at least reactive airway disease. However, without further investigation, it's impossible to say definitively. Now, I will briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back, and inform me if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Lie flat? Discomfort? No, I do not have any discomfort. It is a strong stomach. I eat everything, remember? But be careful, Doctor. I am a big man. You might poke something important. And please hurry. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is firm to palpation, and I detect some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. That elicited a slight response. Do you experience any pain here specifically?
PATIENT: A little bit. When you… push like that. It is just… muscles, I think. From work. Lifting heavy things. Always lifting. I told you, I have a strong stomach. Maybe you are pushing too hard, Doctor? It is not comfortable. I do not understand why you need to push so hard.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the upper right quadrant, coupled with the firm abdominal wall, raises a concern for possible hepatomegaly – an enlarged liver – or cholecystitis – inflammation of the gallbladder. These conditions require further investigation, Mr. Barban. Given your reluctance to disclose comprehensive medical information, and the concerning findings of this brief examination, I recommend a series of blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and an abdominal ultrasound. This will help us determine the underlying cause of your abdominal discomfort and assess your overall health status. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Fine. Yes, do the tests. Just… get it over with. I have wasted enough time here already. But I still think you are making a big deal out of nothing. It is just my stomach. A strong stomach. And please, no more pushing. It is… undignified. And I do not want to pay extra for unnecessary tests. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Barban. I understand your… concerns. I will order the blood tests and schedule an abdominal ultrasound for you. The lab is located down the hall, and the ultrasound appointment will be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Once the results are available, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. However, I must reiterate that delaying proper diagnosis and treatment could have serious consequences. I also strongly advise you to discontinue taking the medication provided by your friend immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think that is enough for today, Doctor. I have things to do. Tell me where to go for these… tests. And I expect a clear bill, with no surprises. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Barban. The lab is directly down the hall to your left. I will have the receptionist provide you with the necessary paperwork. Some patients… simply refuse to help themselves. .
