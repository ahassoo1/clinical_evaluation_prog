DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say he wasn’t shy about mentioning it before he left. It’s embarrassing, okay? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, well, we can certainly take a look at that. It is good you're addressing it. It's better to figure out what's going on. "Really bad," you say... has this been a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Honestly, probably… a few months, at least? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been pretty consistent. And it’s not like… garlic breath or something. It's just… bad. I brush, I floss… I don’t really know what else to do. It's not my concern if people don’t want to be near me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, brushing and flossing are good habits, certainly. Let's try to pinpoint a bit more specifically when it's worse. Does it happen more in the morning, after meals, at night?
PATIENT: Mornings, definitely mornings. Like, really bad when I wake up. And… sometimes after I eat, but not always. It’s hard to tell, honestly. I don't exactly go around sniffing myself all day. Look, is there a quick fix for this or what? I have work tomorrow. Highway maintenance isn’t exactly a job you can do with… unpleasant breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, morning breath is very common, it’s usually from bacteria building up overnight. But consistent bad breath, even with brushing and flossing, suggests something else might be going on. Let's do a quick exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll take a look at your mouth and throat. Then we can talk about possible causes and what we can do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don't take too long. I really don't have time for this. And please don't make me open wide and say "ah" like a kid. I hate that.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I won't make you do anything dramatic. I just need to take a quick look. Can you just open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Here. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your gums are a little red and swollen, and there’s some tartar buildup. Your tongue looks a bit coated. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but it's consistent with gingivitis – inflammation of the gums. The coating on your tongue can also contribute to bad breath. Do you regularly see a dentist?
PATIENT: A dentist? Look, I work on the highway. I don’t exactly have time for… pampering. Not since… well, never. No, I haven't been to a dentist in… a long time. Probably years. Is that bad? I mean, I brush, don’t I?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal. Regular dental check-ups are important for preventing problems like gingivitis, which can lead to more serious issues if left untreated. Brushing is good, but it doesn't reach everything. Okay. So, the most likely cause of your bad breath is poor oral hygiene and gingivitis. We can try a few things. I’m going to recommend a more thorough brushing technique – make sure you’re getting along the gumline. And a tongue scraper can help remove bacteria from your tongue. I strongly recommend seeing a dentist as soon as possible for a professional cleaning and check-up. They can remove the tartar buildup and give you personalized advice on oral hygiene. Would you like me to give you a list of local dentists?
PATIENT: A list? Fine, whatever. A list is fine. As long as they don’t try to sell me a bunch of stuff I don’t need. And don’t tell me I need a root canal or something. Honestly, I don't even want to think about this. Just give me the list and let me get back to work. This whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Here you are. I've included a few options. It's best to call and see if they're accepting new patients and what their fees are. I understand your time is valuable, Zelina, but ignoring this issue can lead to more serious problems down the line. I’ll also write you a prescription for a stronger mouthwash with chlorhexidine, which can help reduce bacteria. Use it as directed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… thanks. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Zelina. And please consider scheduling a dental appointment. .
