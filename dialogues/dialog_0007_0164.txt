DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I’m Valerie Hernandez, one of the internal medicine doctors here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Hernandez, it’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s a bit strange, really. I’ve been feeling… unwell after eating fava beans. It started a few weeks ago, and I just figured it was something I ate, but it keeps happening. And my skin… it’s gotten a little yellow. Not a lot, but enough that people have noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit unusual. Feeling unwell after fava beans and noticing some yellowing of the skin… We’ll definitely figure this out. First, let's talk about this reaction to the fava beans. Can you describe what you mean by "unwell"?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s hard to explain. It's like a really bad tiredness, just completely drained. And sometimes I get a bit dizzy, and my stomach feels…off. Not sick, exactly, just… uncomfortable. It usually happens within a few hours of eating them, and lasts a day or two. It’s just… debilitating, honestly. I love them, I grew up eating them, but I’m scared to now.
DOCTOR: Okay, debilitating tiredness, dizziness, and stomach discomfort within hours of eating fava beans, lasting a day or two... That gives me some ideas. And you said this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks ago, I think. It wasn't immediate, like I'd eaten them my whole life with no problem. Then suddenly… this. I don't remember anything different about how I was eating them, or anything else I was eating with them, really. It just…started. It’s quite worrying. I haven’t changed anything in my diet otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned your skin is a little yellow?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It’s not bright yellow, it’s more… a slight tinge. My daughter actually pointed it out. She said I looked a bit… pale and jaundiced, I think she said. I looked in the mirror and I could see it, especially in my eyes. It’s not horrible, but it’s definitely there and it’s making me nervous. I haven't had any other symptoms, just the tiredness and the yellow skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight yellowing of the skin and eyes, along with the tiredness after fava beans. Let's get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don't have any allergies that I know of, and I’m not currently taking any medications. I see my dentist regularly, and I had a check-up with my primary care doctor about a year ago and everything was fine then. It’s why this is so strange!
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known medical conditions, allergies, or medications. Let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms, or any blood disorders, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother’s side of the family is from Romania, and we didn’t really talk about medical things much. My grandmother was… old-fashioned, and didn’t really go to the doctor. I know my grandfather had some stomach problems, but I don’t know what kind. My father's side is American, and I don’t think anyone had anything like this. I have a sister, and I’ll have to ask her if she’s experienced anything similar, but I don’t think so. I’m really not sure, to be honest. It wasn’t something we discussed much, if at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It's not always easy to have that information. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I’ve never smoked. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely – maybe once a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle, mostly. I eat well, I try to get some exercise, and I don't really go out partying or anything like that. It’s just… this is so baffling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Now, just to confirm, are you currently experiencing any fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever at all. I haven't been sick, so no nausea or vomiting. My stomach feels uncomfortable after the beans, but it's not really pain. And no changes in my urine or stool color that I’ve noticed, no. It really is just the tiredness and the yellowing. And the dizziness. It's just… weird. I'm starting to worry it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mande, based on what you’ve told me – the tiredness, dizziness, and yellowing of your skin after eating fava beans, with no other major symptoms – I'm concerned about a possible enzyme deficiency called G6PD deficiency. It's more common in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, which could explain the connection to your Romanian heritage. It can cause what's called hemolytic anemia, which is what might be causing your symptoms. To be sure, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. Hemolytic anemia? Is that… dangerous? I’ve never heard of G6PD deficiency. Is that what’s causing all this? I mean, I love fava beans, but… Yes, absolutely, please do whatever tests you think are necessary. A physical exam and blood tests sound perfectly fine. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. And if I can never eat fava beans again… well, that's something I need to know. I'm a little scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It can be serious if left untreated, but it's also manageable. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The blood tests will confirm whether or not you have the deficiency, and we'll go from there. First, let me do a quick exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look for any signs of jaundice. Then we’ll head over to the lab. Okay, Mande. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I do notice a slight yellowing of your eyes and a mild pallor in your skin, which supports my initial concern. Now, let’s head over to the lab for the blood tests. It'll take a little bit to get the results back. While we're waiting, I want to emphasize that avoiding fava beans is a good idea until we have a definitive diagnosis. Do you have any questions for me before we go?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Avoiding fava beans… definitely. I can do that. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I’ve eaten them my whole life. Um… how long will the blood tests take? And what exactly are they looking for? Is it a painful test? And… if it is this G6PD deficiency… what does that mean for me? Will I need… treatment? I’m sorry, I’m just a little overwhelmed. I really appreciate you explaining things, though. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed, Mande. It’s a lot to take in. The blood tests should take about 24-48 hours to come back, sometimes a little quicker depending on the lab. We're looking for a specific enzyme level in your red blood cells. A low level indicates a G6PD deficiency. The test itself is a standard blood draw; it's usually not painful, just a quick pinch. If it is G6PD deficiency, it means your red blood cells are more fragile and can break down when exposed to certain triggers, like fava beans. The main treatment is avoidance of those triggers. We’ll also discuss other things to be mindful of, such as certain medications that can also cause problems. We’ll create a plan to manage it together. It's usually very manageable with some simple precautions. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. And then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any severe fatigue, shortness of breath, or dark urine, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable, like you said. Avoidance and being careful with medications. I can do that. And thank you for telling me about the emergency room symptoms. That's good to know. No, I think that covers it for now. Thank you, Dr. Hernandez. You've been very patient and helpful. I was really worried before, but I feel a little bit better knowing what we're looking for, and what the plan is. Let’s go ahead and do the blood test. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm glad I could ease some of your worry, Mande. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure. Just remember, we'll discuss the results as soon as they're available, and we’ll create a plan together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns in the meantime.
