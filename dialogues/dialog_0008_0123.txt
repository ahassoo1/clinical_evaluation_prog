DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my skin’s been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, honestly. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just hasn’t gone away. It's all over, really, but especially on my arms and back.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin… that’s certainly unpleasant. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three, maybe four weeks now. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent the last week or so. Not constant, like, it doesn’t itch all the time, but it flares up a lot. Especially at night, which makes it hard to sleep!
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything in particular that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I don't know, really. I haven't noticed anything specific. I've been using the same laundry detergent for years, and I haven’t changed soaps. I did start a new garden this spring, lots of digging around in the dirt… could that be it? I hadn’t thought of that before.
DOCTOR: That’s good to consider - gardening and getting into the dirt. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, besides the itching, have you noticed any rash, bumps, blisters, or any changes in the skin appearance where it’s itchy?
PATIENT: No, no rash or blisters. It just… looks normal, really. Maybe a little dry, but I live in Florida, so that’s not unusual. It’s mostly just the itching, it’s so frustrating! I don’t see any bumps or anything like that, though. Just red when I scratch, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had this itching happen before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: No, never like this before. I get dry skin in the winter when I travel, but that’s easily fixed with lotion. This is… different. It’s deeper, you know? Not just on the surface. And it's not seasonal, which is why I'm worried. It's August!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Allergies… let me think. No known medication allergies. I’m a little sensitive to shellfish, but that’s just a tummy ache, not a serious allergy. And no allergies to anything else that I can think of. I haven't had any reactions to anything in a long time, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else, Doctor. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I haven’t had any problems with that since. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I try to eat well and stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and pneumonia previously. And your family... is there anyone in your family with skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis, or any other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tricky one. My mother had some skin sensitivity, she always used a special soap, but I don’t think it was anything serious like eczema. My father had high blood pressure, and my brother has diabetes, but I don’t think anyone had anything specifically with their skin. It’s a big family, though, so it’s hard to keep track! I’m not sure, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s alright. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... well, I'm retired, thankfully. I used to work as a political scientist, but now I mostly garden, read, and spend time with my grandkids. I live alone, but they visit often. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to be healthy, as I said. I do worry a lot, though. Maybe that’s part of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information, Ms. Cassimatis. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine with me. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, your skin does look generally normal. No rash, no significant lesions. It’s not particularly dry, but the skin is warm to the touch. I don't feel any unusual lumps or bumps. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, it could be a number of things, possibly related to a mild allergic reaction, dry skin exacerbated by something, or even stress, as you mentioned. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule a few things out. I'm going to order a simple blood test to check for common allergies and rule out any underlying inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood test is fine. I’m just glad you’re looking into it. I was starting to worry it was something awful! Do I need to fast for it?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to fast. You can eat and drink as normal. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend using a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer a couple of times a day. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that’s easier said than done. If the itching gets significantly worse, or if you develop any rash, blisters, or fever, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Fragrance-free moisturizer, avoid scratching, and call if it gets worse. I can definitely do that. Will the results take long? And how will I get them?
DOCTOR: The results should be back in a couple of days, usually. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. You can also check the patient portal online if you have access. In the meantime, let’s see if the moisturizer helps. If we don’t see any improvement after a week, we might consider a referral to a dermatologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Moisturizer for a week and then see what happens. And if it doesn't get better, the dermatologist. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. It's been driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I understand it can be incredibly frustrating. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just getting the blood test ordered is a relief. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, Ms. Cassimatis, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: .
