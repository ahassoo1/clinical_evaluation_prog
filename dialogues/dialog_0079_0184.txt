DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 76 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, seventy-six. Look, I ain’t got all day, Doc. It’s about… well, lookin’ at myself. I don’t like what I see, that’s what. Too much… sag, you understand? It’s disrespectful, lookin’ like that. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Disrespectful, you say. I understand you’re concerned about your appearance, Mr. Trendler. Perhaps we can clarify what specifically is concerning you?
PATIENT: Clarify? What more needs clarifying? I’m a man! I used to be… strong. Now I look like a melted candle. Everything is droopin’. My stomach, my arms… everything. You a doctor, you see these things. Don’t need a whole explanation. Just fix it! What can you do about it? And how long will it take? I got things to do, you know. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears you’re concerned about skin laxity – the loss of firmness in your skin – affecting your abdomen and arms. While I appreciate your directness, Mr. Trendler, a proper assessment is necessary to determine the underlying cause and the best course of action. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not really. I eat plenty. Always have. Good Jamaican food, you understand. Not one of these skinny diets. I just… got older. That’s all. Things fall down when you get old. It's common sense, Doc. You don’t need to ask silly questions about my plate. Just tell me if you can pull it up again, or what. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: While aging is certainly a factor, Mr. Trendler, sudden changes in body composition warrant investigation. It's important to rule out other potential causes. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any changes in your appetite or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? I told you, I eat good! Every day. Rice and peas, jerk chicken, fish… you name it. Energy levels… well, I’m seventy-six! What do you expect? I don’t run marathons anymore. I sit and watch the cricket. Look, Doc, you’re askin’ a lot of pointless questions. I come here to get fixed, not to give you a life history. Are you going to do something or not? I haven't got all day to be questioned.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, a thorough assessment is essential for your safety and to ensure I provide appropriate care. While your concerns are valid, I need to understand your overall health status before recommending any procedures. Have you noticed any other changes in your body, such as new lumps, pain, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Lumps? No lumps! Pain? A little achin' in the joints, like any old man. Fatigue? Well, I get tired, of course. I’m not a spring chicken, you know! This is gettin’ ridiculous. You're treatin’ me like I’m some sort of child. Look, I’m a pile driver operator. I’ve built things, strong things. I know my body. I want my stomach pulled up, my arms tightened. That’s what I want. Can you do it or can’t you? Stop askin’ about my aches and pains. It's disrespectful, askin' an old man about his body like that.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. Let's proceed with a physical examination then. I need to assess the extent of the skin laxity and rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to these changes. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Lie down? At my age? Fine, fine. But don’t expect miracles. And be quick about it. I got a cricket match to get home to. Just try not to poke too much. It all hurts, you know.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Trendler. I’m noting some decreased muscle tone in the abdominal region, as you’ve described. There’s also mild tenderness upon palpation in the lower abdomen… any history of hernias or previous abdominal surgeries?
PATIENT: Hernias? Surgeries? Good heavens, no! I'm a strong man, was a strong man. Never needed cuttin' and stitchin'. I built things, didn't have things built on me. Maybe a few scrapes and bruises from the job, but that's it. Tenderness? Probably just from… livin’, you know? Seventy-six years of livin’ will make things a little tender. Don’t go lookin’ for trouble where there ain’t none. Just tell me if you can fix it. That's all I care about. Hurry up, will ya?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm now assessing the skin laxity in your arms. I'm noting similar decreased muscle tone here as well. And there’s a slight decrease in subcutaneous fat. I also observe some mild skin thinning. Now, Mr. Trendler, I need to ask, have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits recently, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Weight? I told you, I eat good! Habits? They're fine, what habits? I go when I need to go, like everyone else. You're askin' the same questions over and over! It's insulting, really. Like you don’t believe me. I'm a big man, was a big man! I eat, I sleep, I watch cricket. Simple as that! Is there a point to all this pokin’ and proddin’ and questionin’, or are you just tryin’ to waste my time? Tell me straight: can you fix the sag, or can't you? Because if you can't, I’m walkin’ out that door right now. I’ve got better things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, before I can determine if a procedure is appropriate, I need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. I’m reviewing your electronic health record now. I see here you had a cholesterol check six months ago, which was slightly elevated. And a blood pressure reading last year that was a little high. Have you been prescribed any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Medications? A little pill for the cholesterol, that's all. Doc gave it to me last year. Said it was just a precaution. And a little somethin' for the pressure sometimes, when it gets too high. But it ain’t regular. I feel fine! Mostly fine. Look, Doc, I ain’t a sick man. I’m just… older. Things droop when you get old. It's a fact of life! I don't need a whole medical investigation. Just tell me if you can fix it. I’m wastin’ my time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, the medications you are taking, even if not taken regularly, can sometimes have side effects that affect muscle tone and skin elasticity. And elevated cholesterol and blood pressure can contribute to decreased circulation. While I appreciate your patience, before I discuss potential procedures, I need to recommend a few blood tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. This is standard protocol, and it ensures your safety. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more pokin’ and proddin’. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. Fine, fine. Do your tests. But don't expect miracles. And hurry up about it. I got a cricket match to get to, you know. Don't want to miss the good part. Just… get it over with. But if it takes all day, I'm walkin' out. Understand? I haven't got forever. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I’ll order the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. Once the results are back, we can discuss potential treatment options. In the meantime, I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review the results. I will send the lab order to your file. Do you have any questions before I do that?
