DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It’s about this foot. Been botherin’ me for weeks now, and it just won’t heal. Honestly, I’ve seen better work from amateurs. And I should know, I am a scientist, you see. Medical, no less.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Louine. It sounds frustrating to have something linger for weeks, especially with your background in medicine. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Frustrating doesn’t begin to cover it. It’s a sore, right here on my foot. It started as a little… well, a little thing. A scrape, I think. But it just… got worse. And worse. Now it’s red and angry-lookin’, and it hurts when I put any weight on it. Honestly, the nurses here haven't been much help. They seem… young. Inexperienced.
DOCTOR: Okay, a red and angry-looking sore on the top of your right foot that’s been getting worse over weeks and is painful with weight-bearing. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let's get a better understanding of what's going on. First, can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Honestly, it's like a… a burning. And a throbbing. Sometimes it feels like little needles. It’s worst when I stand up, or try to walk. And it keeps me up at night, that’s for sure. I’ve always had a high pain tolerance, mind you. Years in the lab, you get used to… discomfort. But this… this is persistent. And frankly, it shouldn’t be this difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a burning, throbbing pain with needle-like sensations, worse with standing and walking, and disrupting your sleep. That certainly sounds unpleasant. And I appreciate you mentioning your high pain tolerance; that gives me a good baseline. Have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Oh, yes. A little. It's… not much, mind you. Just a bit of… yellowish fluid. It gets on my socks, mostly. I try to keep it clean, but it's difficult. And it smells… unpleasant. Not a terrible smell, but noticeable. Honestly, the hygiene practices around here are… questionable. I’ve had to remind them a few times to wash their hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage with an odor. That’s helpful information. Now, have you had a fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I check my temperature regularly, you see. Always have. A scientist is methodical, Dr. Bacy. Always. And no chills. Just… tired. Very tired. But that could be my age, honestly. And the constant discomfort, of course. It’s draining. It's probably just old age, isn’t it? Honestly, at my age, one expects a few aches and pains. But this… this seems excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. It's good you monitor your temperature. While aches and pains can be common with age, it's important to investigate anything that's causing significant discomfort and disrupting your life. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, finally. I was wondering when you were going to actually examine it. Yes, go ahead. But be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. And please, wash your hands first. One can’t be too careful these days. Honestly, I’ve seen the state of some of these facilities.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve washed my hands and have put on fresh gloves. Let me take a look. Okay, I see some redness and swelling here on the top of your foot. There is some yellowish discharge, as you mentioned, and it feels warm to the touch. It’s tender when I press here… and here. It appears there’s some inflammation present. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it could be a few different things, like an infection or a localized inflammatory process. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? Well, I suppose it's necessary. Honestly, I’m not fond of needles, but if it’s going to get to the bottom of this… Yes, go ahead. But please, choose a competent phlebotomist. I’ve had some… unfortunate experiences in the past. And tell me what these tests are, exactly. I’m a scientist, Dr. Bacy. I need details.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. We’ll need a blood test to check for signs of infection and inflammation. Specifically, we’ll be looking at your white blood cell count and a marker called CRP, which indicates inflammation in the body. We will also do a wound culture to identify if any bacteria are present. The phlebotomist we use is highly experienced, and I'll make a note of your preference. Would you be able to tell me about any allergies you might have, especially to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think. I have a slight reaction to shellfish, but that’s hardly relevant. And I’m a little sensitive to penicillin, developed a rash once, a long time ago. Nothing serious. Mostly, I try to avoid medications altogether. They interfere with my… internal balance. Honestly, a good night's sleep and a healthy diet are usually sufficient. But this… this is proving persistent. What about… diabetes? Do you know if I have that? My husband… he had it, towards the end. I might have inherited it.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish and penicillin allergy noted. We’ll be sure to avoid those. And that’s good to know about your husband and the potential for diabetes; we’ll include a blood sugar test as part of the blood work. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything right now, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A little something for my arthritis, mostly. It's a cream, you rub it on. And I take a multivitamin, every morning. Can't be too careful, you know. And sometimes, a little something for my sleep. Just when I really can’t get to rest. It's… herbal. Nothing too strong. Honestly, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. This… whole medical establishment… It’s all so… invasive. But fine. I'll tell you. It's Melatonin. And sometimes, chamomile tea. Does that suffice?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis cream, a multivitamin, Melatonin, and chamomile tea. That’s helpful. Now, before we proceed with the tests, are there any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, my vision isn't what it used to be, but that's to be expected. And I get a little… tingling in my hands and feet, sometimes. Nothing major, really. Just a little… pins and needles. Mostly, I’m just tired. And this foot… it just won’t heal. Honestly, it's a distraction. Interferes with my work, you see. I have experiments to conduct. Important experiments. I used to be a very productive scientist, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some changes in vision, tingling in your hands and feet, and persistent fatigue. I understand this foot is interfering with your work and is causing you frustration, and I want to get to the bottom of this for you. Given your symptoms and history, I’m ordering the following tests: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel—that includes a blood sugar check—a CRP level, a wound culture, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to assess your thyroid function. We’ll also check your vitamin D level. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend keeping the foot elevated and keeping it clean and dry. I'll also provide a prescription for a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent further infection. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Topical ointment… hmm. I suppose that’s acceptable. As long as it doesn’t have any… harsh chemicals. And the elevation, yes, I can manage that. Honestly, I prefer to treat things myself whenever possible. But fine. A little assistance won’t hurt. Just please, make sure the lab results are accurate. I’ve had… unfortunate experiences with inaccurate testing in the past. And how long will these results take? I have experiments waiting, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I assure you we use a reputable lab with strict quality control measures. We’ll double-check everything to ensure accuracy. The results typically take 24-48 hours. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if the pain worsens, you notice any fever or chills, or if the redness spreads, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… please be thorough. Honestly, I’ve seen a lot of incompetence in my years. And don’t underestimate the importance of a good night’s sleep. It’s a lost art, you know. A lost art. Very well. I suppose I’ll be going now. I expect a prompt call with the results. Don't keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I’ll do everything I can to get you answers as quickly as possible. The nurse will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Louine.
