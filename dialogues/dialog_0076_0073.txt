DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Woodring. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's… embarrassing. I’ve been to the doctor about this a couple of times now, and nothing seems to stick. Just… constant diarrhea. It's been going on for weeks. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least three. Maybe longer, I honestly lost track after the first week. It’s not just a little upset, it’s… a lot. And it doesn't seem to matter what I eat. I've tried cutting things out, you know? Bland food, everything. Nothing helps. It's incredibly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive how?
PATIENT: Well, how do you think it's disruptive? I’m a painter, okay? I have jobs, deadlines. I can’t exactly run to a bathroom every hour on a scaffolding. It’s… unprofessional. And frankly, it's exhausting. I'm losing money, and I'm tired of explaining things to clients. It's just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Right, right. A painter. And you’ve tried dietary changes… anything else you've attempted to resolve this yourself?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not one for… herbal remedies or anything like that. I took some of those over-the-counter things, the stuff for upset stomachs? They didn't do a thing. Honestly, I just hoped it would go away on its own. I really don't see the point in constantly bothering doctors if they can't fix it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Do you have a fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Just… this. And the inconvenience. I haven’t felt generally unwell, just… constantly needing to be near a restroom. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me to describe that. No, not… a lot. Maybe a little sometimes, but it's not like… a river. Is that… normal? Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know it's unpleasant and it won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s all over the place. Some days I can eat a little, some days I don’t even bother. What's the point when it’s just going to… happen anyway? I'm losing weight, I think. Not that I have much to lose, but still. It’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: Any recent travel?
PATIENT: No. I haven’t left the state in years. I work, I go home. That’s it. It’s not like I’ve been… gallivanting around the globe eating questionable food. Really, doctor, I’m starting to feel like you’re just going through a checklist. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: I am gathering information, Ms. Woodring. It's what doctors do. Now, any family history of… gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Honestly? Who keeps track of that? My mother… she had stomach trouble sometimes, but everyone does, don’t they? Nothing serious, as far as I know. My father… he died young. Heart attack. Not… stomach stuff. Look, my family isn't exactly known for sharing personal medical details. It's not a topic of lively conversation. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just the basics. Blood pressure, something like that. Nothing fancy. A small dose, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And, well, I took some of those anti-diarrheal pills, like I said. Didn't help, so I stopped. I don’t like taking pills if they don’t do anything, frankly. It feels… wasteful.
DOCTOR: And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Dust, pollen… nothing life-threatening. I get a little sniffly in the spring, that's it. No food allergies, as far as I know. I've eaten everything under the sun. I really don't understand what's going on. It's just… frustrating. I have work to do. This is wasting my time, and it's wasting your time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. It won’t be… extensive, but I need to listen to your abdomen, and perhaps check for some dehydration. Then we can decide on a course of action. Do you agree?
