DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sieh. It is good to meet you also. I… have a problem with my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes out. It has been happening for… maybe three days now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear for about three days. That certainly sounds concerning. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellowish. Not much, but it is there. And… it does not smell, if that is important. I try to keep it very clean, you understand. I do not want… infection.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you're keeping it clean, Mr. Radillo. And it's helpful to know it’s mostly clear with some yellow tinges and no smell. Has there been any pain with this, or any change in your hearing?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. But… yes, my hearing. It is… a little bit muffled. Like… when you put cotton in your ear, but not so much. It is difficult to explain. Things sound… far away, perhaps? I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes. Not always, but… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so muffled hearing, especially noticing it over the last three days, and having to ask people to repeat themselves. Have you experienced any dizziness or ringing in your ears along with this?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor. I do not think so. Sometimes… a little bit of… buzzing. Very quiet buzzing. It comes and goes. It is not constant. I thought maybe it was the refrigerator. It is very old, you understand. But maybe… maybe it is the ear? I am not sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve been observing that, Mr. Radillo. It’s helpful to know about the buzzing sound – whether it’s constant or intermittent. Now, have you had any recent ear infections, or any injuries to your ear – even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, no infections. Not recently. A long time ago, when I was a boy, maybe. But not as an adult. And… no injuries. I am very careful. I do not do anything that would… hurt my ear. I clean it with… a cotton swab, very gently. Is that… bad? I always worry I will do something wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about no recent infections or injuries, and that you’re being careful with cleaning. Using cotton swabs can sometimes push wax further in and cause problems, so it's generally best to avoid them if possible. We can discuss that more later. Now, let's get a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any of those. I am… usually very healthy. I walk every day. And I try to eat good food. My doctor… before, he always said my blood pressure was very good. And… no heart problems. I do not take any pills, if that is what you mean. Just… vitamins, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Radillo. Staying active and eating well are very important. And no regular medications besides vitamins is helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, Doctor. Not even as a boy. My mother… she always said I was too strong to be sick! She was a very… practical woman. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No operations, nothing like that. I hope I never have to. They sound… frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about surgery, Mr. Radillo. It's good to know you haven't had any. Now, thinking about your family… are there any hearing problems or ear issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My sister… she has trouble hearing. She is older than me. She says it is… from working in the factory, too much noise. And my father… he was always a little bit hard of hearing, when he was very old. But… I do not think anyone else. Not my mother, not my brothers. Just my sister and my father, when they were old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hearing loss in your sister due to noise exposure and your father in old age. That's good to know. And just to complete the picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And… very little alcohol. Maybe one glass of wine… with dinner, sometimes. On special occasions. And… no, no drugs. Never. I do not like those things. They are… bad for the health, you understand. I prefer tea. Very strong tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Radillo. Now, let me take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope – it's just a lighted instrument to look inside your ear canal. It shouldn't hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I see some fluid in the ear canal and the eardrum appears a bit… dull. There’s also some redness. It doesn’t look like a ruptured eardrum, but there is some inflammation. I also notice some wax build-up.
PATIENT: Oh. That does not sound… good. Dull? Inflammation? Is it… serious? What does that mean? Is it the buzzing? And the wax… is that why I cannot hear so well? Please, Doctor, tell me what is happening. I am a little bit worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Radillo. It’s good you’re asking questions. The dullness of the eardrum and the redness indicate some inflammation, likely an infection of the outer ear canal – we call that otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear, although you don’t need to be a swimmer to get it. The fluid we see is part of that inflammation. The wax buildup could be contributing to the muffled hearing, but the primary issue seems to be the infection. The buzzing sound you're experiencing could be related to the inflammation as well. It's not usually serious if we treat it promptly. To confirm the diagnosis, I'd like to send a sample of the fluid to the lab to check for bacteria. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you need to check for bacteria, then… please do. I want to know what is causing this. I do not want it to get worse. What happens with the sample? And… how do you take it? Will it hurt? I am a little bit… nervous about that, I must admit. It is good you are explaining everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Radillo. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. Taking the sample is usually very quick and doesn't cause much discomfort. I’ll gently clean your ear canal and use a small swab to collect a tiny bit of the fluid. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. The sample will be sent to the lab, and they will analyze it to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. This helps me choose the best antibiotic for you. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, to relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading, I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry, avoiding putting anything in your ear, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers if you have any discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reasonable. Ear drops, keep it dry, no cotton swabs… I can do that. I do not like the idea of putting anything in my ear anyway. And the pain relievers… good. Just in case. How long will the ear drops take to work? And… is it contagious? Should I worry about my family? My sister lives with me, you understand. I do not want her to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. The ear drops usually start to provide some relief within a day or two, but it’s important to complete the full course of treatment, even if your symptoms improve. Usually, it takes about a week to fully clear the infection. And no, otitis externa is not usually contagious. You don't need to worry about your sister catching it. However, it’s a good idea for her to avoid getting water in her ears as well, just as a precaution. I’ll write you a prescription for the ear drops and some instructions on how to use them. I'll also give you a note explaining how to keep the ear dry. I’d like to see you back in a week to check on your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then – if you develop a fever, severe pain, or drainage from your ear – please call the office right away. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. And… thank you for not making me feel… foolish about worrying. It is good to know what is happening, and what to do. I will follow your instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It’s my job to address your concerns and provide you with the best possible care. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if anything changes. Here are your prescription and aftercare instructions. Take care, and I’ll see you in a week.
