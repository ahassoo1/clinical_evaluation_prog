DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, don't have all day, Doc. It's this hand. Shakes, you see? Been happenin' for...oh, I don't know, a while now. Not sure exactly when it started, truthfully. Everything's a blur these days. Just…shakes. It's annoying, is what it is.
DOCTOR: Very well. A tremor, you say. And you haven’t been able to pinpoint when it began?
PATIENT: Pinpoint? Look, I'm eighty years old! Things aren’t exactly filed away neatly in my head, you know? Maybe a few months ago? Longer? Honestly, I was more focused on…well, never you mind. It just started shaking. It wasn't there, then it was. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. A vague onset is not ideal, but we will proceed. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I suppose. Mostly when I'm tryin' to do somethin', like…holdin' a fork. Or signin' somethin'. Though, I haven't signed anything important in ages, thankfully. Used to be a big producer, you know. Directors, the whole shebang. But that was a lifetime ago. Don't really need to be steady-handed for that anymore.
DOCTOR: A producer, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a producer. Big films, little films. Doesn’t matter now, does it? Point is, this hand…it interferes. Makes things…difficult. I just want it stopped. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: We'll certainly investigate the cause of this tremor, Mr. Baide. Now, aside from difficulty with fine motor skills, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I get tired, easy. Eighty years will do that to a person, you know. And my memory’s…shot. We already established that. Besides that…no. Not really. Just the shakiness. It’s…irritatin’. Look, Doc, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any stiffness in your joints, or any pain associated with the shaking?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. It doesn’t hurt. Just…wobbles. Annoyin’ wobbles. Sometimes a little ache, but that’s probably just from…old age. Like I said, everything aches when you get to be my age. Don’t see what all the questions are for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. And have you noticed any changes in your walking, or balance?
PATIENT: Balance is…fine. I haven’t fallen or anything, if that’s what you're askin'. I walk a little slower, maybe. But that's to be expected. I'm not exactly spring chicken here. Honestly, this whole thing is makin' me nervous. Just wanna get this sorted, and get out of here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing…look, I've lived a long life, Doc. There’s been a few things. High blood pressure, I think. And my wife…she had somethin' with her heart. Passed away a few years back, bless her. Other than that…not that I recall. It’s all a blur, like I’ve been sayin'.
DOCTOR: The record indicates you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately fifteen years ago, and managed with medication. Are you currently taking any medications for that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Fifteen years…see? That’s what I mean. Things just…fade. Um…let me think. I think I was on somethin' for the blood pressure. Stopped takin' it a while back. Doctor said somethin' about it being under control. Can’t remember which doctor, though. And that was years ago. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this hand or what?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, it's important that I have a complete understanding of your medical history to ensure I provide you with the best possible care. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your hypertension?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember! It was a little white pill, I think. Maybe pink? Does it matter? It was years ago! I’m eighty years old, not a computer! Frankly, I'm gettin' tired of all these questions. Just look at my hand, Doc. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please extend your arms in front of you. I observe a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on your right side. Now, could you please tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with each hand?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. There. Happy now? See? Shakes. It’s obvious. Don’t need a fancy exam for somethin' that's plain as day.
DOCTOR: I observe difficulties with coordination and accuracy during the finger-to-nose test. Now, please try to hold your hands outstretched, palms up.
PATIENT: There. Just…look at ‘em. They’re shakin’. And they feel…heavy, kinda. This is ridiculous. What are you lookin' for anyway? I’m a mess, alright? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Baide. Based on my examination, you exhibit symptoms consistent with a possible essential tremor, though further investigation is warranted to rule out other conditions. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a neurological consultation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurological…consultation? More doctors? More tests? Honestly, Doc, this is a bit much. Look, I just want somethin' to stop the shakin'. I don't need a whole battery of tests. Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I suppose. But I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the aforementioned blood tests, and I will submit a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’d advise avoiding activities that exacerbate the tremor, and I will write you a prescription for propranolol, a beta-blocker, to help manage the symptoms. However, please be aware that this is a temporary measure, and the neurologist will determine the best long-term treatment plan. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before prescribing this medication?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, not that I recall. Maybe a little sniffle with certain flowers, but that's it. Nothing serious. Just...don't want somethin' that'll make me even more forgetful, if that's possible. And look, Doc, just keep it simple, alright? I'm an old man. Complicated stuff goes right over my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. This prescription is for a low dose of propranolol. It’s important to take it as directed, and to report any side effects to your primary care physician. Here is the referral to Dr. Vance, and a list of instructions regarding the blood tests. I would also recommend avoiding caffeine and excessive alcohol consumption, as these can worsen tremors. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just…get me outta here. Hopefully, this pill will do somethin'. Thank you, Doc. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We’ll review the results of your tests and Dr. Vance’s recommendations as soon as they become available. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yeah, right. A good day. Goodbye. .
