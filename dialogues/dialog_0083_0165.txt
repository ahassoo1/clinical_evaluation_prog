DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Clide is fine. Look, I ain’t got a lot of time, if you don’t mind. Been gettin’ fevers on and off for… well, a bit now. Just feelin' lousy, really. Not sure what's causin' 'em.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I understand you're short on time, and we'll do our best to be efficient. “Fevers on and off” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, they come and go. Maybe last a day, maybe half a day. Not super high, you know? Like, I don’t get the chills or nothin'. Just feel warm, kinda tired, achy. Happens maybe… twice a month, give or take. It's been goin' on for… oh, six months, I reckon. Started right around February, maybe March. Hard to remember exactly. It just bothers me, keeps interruptin’ things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fevers coming and going for approximately six months, starting around February or March. Not associated with chills, just feeling warm, tired, and achy. Twice a month, roughly. And when you say "achy," could you describe where you're feeling the aches?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back, lower back, and sometimes my shoulders. Like I pulled somethin', but I didn’t. It’s… hard to explain. Not constant pain, just when the fever comes on, I feel it. And my wife keeps tellin’ me I look flushed when I got one, but I don’t really pay attention to that. I'm a chiropractor, remember? I deal with backs all day, so somethin' being achy doesn't always mean much.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do recall you mentioning your profession. That’s helpful context. So the aches are primarily in your lower back and shoulders, coinciding with the fevers. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms that happen with these fevers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no sniffles. No upset stomach, nothin’ like that. Sometimes I feel a little… foggy, you know? Like I can’t quite think straight. Not bad, just… slow. And maybe a little bit of a headache, but not always. It's not like a migraine or anything. Just a dull ache in my head. No rash, no sore throat... nothin' really noticeable other than the aches and feelin' kinda tired and slow. Honestly, that's why I put it off comin' in for so long. It just seemed like a little somethin'. But it keeps happenin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no cough, congestion, gastrointestinal issues, rash, or sore throat. You’ve described some mild cognitive impairment – feeling “foggy” – and a dull headache accompanying the fevers and fatigue. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual kid stuff - chickenpox, measles, that kinda thing. Nothing serious. Had my gallbladder out maybe fifteen years ago, but that was all. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothin' like that. Pretty healthy, all things considered. I keep active, you know? Workin' on people's backs all day keeps you movin'. And I take a multivitamin, religiously. Never been much for takin' pills, though, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of common childhood illnesses and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. No other significant medical conditions. You mentioned keeping active and taking a multivitamin. Do you take any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the multivitamin, every mornin' with breakfast. That’s it. And sometimes, if my back's really botherin' me, I’ll use some liniment, you know? Rub-on stuff. But that’s not a regular thing. I try to fix things myself, bein’ a chiropractor and all. I don’t believe in loadin’ up on medications unless absolutely necessary. They usually just mask the problem, anyway. I like to get to the root of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the multivitamin and occasional topical liniment. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything as far as I know. I eat pretty much anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's a different story. No reactions to penicillin, no problems with bee stings, nothin'. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. She worries about me, always askin' if somethin' I ate might bother me. But I ain’t had any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, and he had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. My mother had arthritis, real bad in her hands. And my older brother had some kind of cancer, lung cancer, but he smoked like a chimney, so… you know. That’s about it, really. No one else that I can think of had any major health problems. My family, we were all pretty healthy people. Lived a long time, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure and heart disease in your father, and arthritis in your mother. Lung cancer in your brother, with a history of smoking. And finally, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Don’t care for the smell of it, to be honest. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I'm a professional man, Doctor. I take care of people's backs! I can’t be goin’ around doin’ any of that. Keep a clean life, mostly. Like I said, I try to stay active. It's important. Now, are we gettin' close to findin' out what's wrong with me? I really gotta get back to work soon. People are waitin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Clide. Thank you for providing all of that information – it’s very helpful. Given your symptoms – intermittent fevers, aches, fatigue, mild cognitive impairment – and your medical history, there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively minor, like a viral infection, or something that requires further investigation. At this point, I would like to perform a physical examination to assess your overall health and look for any potential clues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got people countin' on me. And please, no pokin' and proddin' if you don't have to. Just get it done so I can get back to work. This is eatin’ into my schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I’ll be as efficient as possible. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen and back. Your temperature is 100.2 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your lower back is slightly tender to palpation, but no other significant findings. Based on the physical exam, we do need to investigate this further. Given the persistent fevers and tenderness in your lower back, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us rule out any infections, inflammatory conditions, or other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Sounds expensive. Look, I don’t have insurance, Doctor. Can’t we just… try somethin’ else? Maybe some muscle relaxants or somethin'? I’m tellin’ ya, it's probably just a pulled muscle. I deal with backs all day, I know these things. I really don’t wanna get into a whole thing with blood tests and bills and… just think it over, okay? Is there anythin' else we can try first? A shot, maybe? A strong pain reliever? I just need somethin' to get me through the day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Clide, and I want to be mindful of that. However, given the nature of your symptoms and the duration of your illness, I’m hesitant to simply treat the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause. A shot or pain reliever might provide temporary relief, but it won’t address the root of the problem. We need to rule out more serious conditions. I do have some options to help mitigate the cost. The clinic has a program for uninsured patients, which can provide a discount on lab work. I can also order a more limited blood panel to start, focusing on the most common causes of fever and inflammation. This would be less expensive than a comprehensive panel. Alternatively, if you’re not comfortable with blood work at this time, I can refer you to a specialist – a rheumatologist or an infectious disease doctor – who can further evaluate your symptoms and determine the best course of action. However, please be aware that specialist visits often come with higher costs. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: A discount, huh? Okay, fine. A discount is somethin'. But a limited panel. That’s all I’m willin’ to do. Just the basics. No fancy tests, no nothin' extra. And no referrals to specialists. I don’t need to see a bunch of different doctors rackin' up bills. I’m a chiropractor, remember? I'm pretty good at diagnosin' things myself. Just get me a list of what you’re gonna test, and how much it's gonna cost with the discount, okay? And make it quick, Doctor. I’m losin’ money by sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I can definitely do that. We’ll order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a C-reactive protein test to measure inflammation levels. These are the basic tests to start. Here’s the lab order, which you can take to the lab across the street. And here’s the cost estimate with the uninsured patient discount. The total cost should be approximately $125. The lab results should be available in 24-48 hours. Once I receive them, I’ll review them with you and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to manage your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the lab tests or the next steps?
PATIENT: $125… alright, that's doable, I guess. Ibuprofen, huh? I got some at home. Okay. Look, just call me as soon as you get the results, okay? Don’t make me wait. I need to get back to work, and I need to know what’s goin’ on. And I expect a straight answer. No fancy medical jargon, okay? Just tell me what it is and what I need to do. Alright, I think that's it. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can go now, Clide. I will personally review your results as soon as they become available and call you directly with a clear explanation of the findings. We’ll discuss the next steps together. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I hope you feel better soon.
