DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It’s my hearing, alright? Woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy. On one side. It’s quite obvious, really. I don't need a long explanation of everything, do I?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and that's concerning – sudden hearing loss and facial drooping is something we need to take seriously. Just to be clear, which ear is it, and can you tell me when exactly you noticed this happening this morning?
PATIENT: It’s the left ear, naturally. And… let me think. I woke up around 6:00, as usual. My husband – well, late husband – always made sure I was up on time. Anyway, I went to turn on the radio, and it was just… muffled. Then I looked in the mirror to adjust my scarf, and that’s when I saw it. The left side of my face isn't right. It all happened pretty quickly, if that's what you want to know. Honestly, I'd hoped it would just go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around 6:00 AM this morning you noticed muffled hearing in your left ear and facial drooping on the left side. And it happened relatively quickly. I appreciate you telling me that. Just to be thorough – and it’s good you came in – I’m going to ask a few quick questions, then do a brief exam. Have you experienced any dizziness, headache, or vision changes at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache? Perhaps a little, but I get those often. It's nothing unusual. Vision… no, I think my vision is fine. Honestly, I don't see what all these questions are for. Is this going to take long? I have commitments this afternoon. And I really don’t do well with being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, a usual headache, and no vision changes. I understand your time is valuable, and I'll be as quick as possible. These questions help me rule things out and get a clearer picture. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick exam. I’ll check your facial muscles, your hearing, and do a brief neurological check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, it's probably just a bad nerve. My brother had something similar once, and it cleared up on its own. Though he was much younger than me. And he lived a healthier lifestyle, I must say. Proceed. But be gentle, alright? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, close your eyes tight for me… good. Now, can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s the right side. It’s weak. It’s quite obvious, really. Do you need me to repeat it? I can do it again. Though it's rather undignified, isn't it? An older woman contorting her face for… what, exactly?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. There is noticeable weakness on the right side of your face when raising your eyebrows. Okay, now can you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s pathetic. Look at it. It’s drooping. I look ridiculous. Are you writing all this down? Because frankly, it’s depressing. And it's probably nothing, you know. Just a temporary thing. A little… twitch. I've had twitches before. It’s old age, what can you do? Now, can we move on? This is rather… unnerving.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm documenting everything, and yes, I see the asymmetry when you smile as well. Now, could you try to puff out your cheeks with air, like a balloon?
PATIENT: See? It’s… deflated. Like a punctured tire. Is that what you wanted to see? Honestly, you're making me anxious. I knew I should have just stayed home and rested. I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon. They’ll be furious if I don’t show. And Mrs. Abernathy is bringing her famous lemon squares… This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see that the right cheek doesn't inflate fully, and there's some air leakage. Now, can you stick your tongue out for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's… crooked. Everything is crooked! Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Is this going to take much longer? I really think I need a glass of water. And perhaps a lie-down. This whole experience is dreadfully unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see slight deviation to the right. Okay, Stephane. I'm going to be upfront with you. Based on what I'm seeing – the sudden onset of facial weakness, the difficulty raising your eyebrow, smiling, puffing out your cheeks, and the tongue deviation – this is concerning for something called Bell’s Palsy, or possibly, though less likely, a stroke. I need to ask you some more questions, quickly, to help me determine the best course of action. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Stroke?! Good heavens! I’ve never been so insulted! I may be getting on in years, but I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. A little twinge, perhaps, but nothing serious. High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I watch what I eat, you know. And cholesterol… well, my late husband used to say I had good cholesterol. Though he wasn’t a doctor, mind you. It’s probably just a muscle spasm. A very inconvenient muscle spasm. And I need to be at bridge club this afternoon. Mrs. Abernathy’s lemon squares are non-negotiable. Really, are you sure you're a proper doctor? This all sounds rather…alarmist.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. I understand your concerns, and I apologize if I alarmed you, but it’s important to rule out serious possibilities. Even if it is Bell’s Palsy, we need to start treatment as quickly as possible to improve your chances of a full recovery. Regardless, we need to get some further testing done immediately. I want to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out a stroke, and I'll need to get a blood test to check your overall health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: CT scan?! Blood test?! Honestly, this is outrageous! I came in here with a slightly droopy face, and now you want to subject me to all sorts of… invasive procedures? I haven't had a scan since… well, never! And I hate needles. I faint, you know. Absolutely faint. I am not going through with any of this. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and I’ve decided I'm simply going home to rest. Perhaps it’s just a cold. A very inconvenient cold. Stop making a fuss over nothing. I'm leaving now.
