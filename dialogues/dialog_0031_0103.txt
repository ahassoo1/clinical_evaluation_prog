DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I am Dr. Rakosky. Please have a seat. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, my back, mostly. It's been hurting, real bad, for a few weeks now. It’s lower back… right in the small of my back. It makes it hard to even stand up straight sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain for a few weeks now. I understand. And it’s affecting your ability to stand straight?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s… not sharp, not like a sudden pain. More like a dull ache, all the time. And it gets worse when I try to do things, you know? Like… bending over to pick something up, or even just walking a long way. I used to walk every morning, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that worsens with activity… that’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… laying down seems to help a little. And… warm baths. A warm bath will take the edge off for a bit, maybe an hour or so. But it always comes back. Nothing really makes it go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, laying down and warm baths provide some temporary relief. Have you experienced any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain going down my legs. And no tingling or numbness, no. Just the ache in my back. But sometimes… it feels weak, you know? Like my legs might give out if I stand for too long. Is that… part of it? I don’t know much about backs, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no radiating pain or numbness, but you've noticed some weakness in your legs with prolonged standing. That's good information. Let's get a bit more of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing to this. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… well, the doctor told me a few years back… something about my bones being…thin. Like they weren’t as strong as they should be. He said a word… osteoporosis? Yes, that was it. Osteoporosis. He said to take some calcium, but… honestly, I forget a lot. I try, but… Other than that… I don’t really know. I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting old, I guess. Divorced, you know. Stress does things to you. But nothing major, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Osteoporosis is important to know, thank you. And you're right, stress can certainly play a role. Have you ever had any injuries to your back before – a fall, a twist, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I can remember. I was pretty careful when I was younger. Worked in an office, mostly. No heavy lifting or anything like that. Maybe a little strain here and there, pulling a muscle, but nothing serious enough to go to the doctor about. I think I’d remember a bad fall or something. It's been… a long time. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant back injuries that you recall. And you mentioned being divorced; do you have a lot of emotional stress currently?
PATIENT: Oh, the divorce… that was… a long time ago now. It's not so much the divorce now, you know? It's… my daughter. She’s having some troubles. Financial troubles mostly. I try to help, but… it's stressful, worrying about her. And not being able to do enough. That gets to me, mostly. It’s… a weight, you know? A big weight.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds stressful, and chronic stress can exacerbate pain. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I take a calcium supplement, sometimes. When I remember. Like I said, I’m not good at remembering things. And… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill, once a day. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. I used to take something for allergies, but the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, calcium supplement intermittently and a medication for high blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can remember. I used to take a lot of penicillin when I was a kid, but… that was a long time ago. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. Is this… important? All these questions? I just want my back to feel better.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Vankampen, I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. It helps me understand the whole picture and rule out potential causes or interactions. Okay. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. And my father… he broke his hip when he was older. Fell down the stairs. I don't know much beyond that. We weren't very close, my family. Not a lot of talking about… health things. Everyone just kind of dealt with it on their own. Is that what you need to know? About my family?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and a hip fracture in your father. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. It hurts, you know? It really does.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, can you tell me where it hurts the most when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, right there! Yes, right there. And a little bit… all around it, really. It’s not one specific spot, it’s more of a… dull ache, all over this area. And… when you press, it kind of… radiates a little bit. Not down my legs, but… across my lower back. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting tenderness with palpation in the lumbar region with some referred pain across the lower back. Alright, can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Ooh… No, I can’t reach my toes. Not anymore. And it hurts, Doctor. It really does. It’s… tight, you know? It feels like something is blocking me. I can’t bend over like I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting limited range of motion with forward flexion, accompanied by pain. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I’m going to lift your leg straight up. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I do this.
PATIENT: Okay… No… no pain down my leg. Just a little stretch, that’s all. It doesn't hurt. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain with the straight leg raise. Okay, everything sounds clear listening to your back. And walking seems relatively normal, though you're moving a bit cautiously. Based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you’re experiencing lumbar strain, likely exacerbated by stress and potentially related to your osteoporosis. However, to rule out other causes and assess the extent of the problem, I'd like to order some imaging. I recommend an X-ray of your lumbar spine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes. Will it… hurt? I don’t like things that hurt. And… how long will I have to wait? I have a few things I need to do. But… if it’s necessary, then I guess I can wait. I just want my back to feel better.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself shouldn't hurt at all, Mr. Vankampen. It's a very quick procedure. You will simply stand or lie down while a technician takes a few pictures. The wait time will depend on the availability of the technician and the radiology department, but I can have my nurse schedule it for you as soon as possible. I will also order some blood work to assess your vitamin D levels and rule out any inflammatory conditions. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take calcium supplements if you are able to remember, and I will prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms. I also suggest applying a warm compress to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… manageable. Muscle relaxant… okay. And the warm compress… I can do that. I have a heating pad at home. So… the X-ray and the blood work… and then the pills and the heating pad? Is that right? And… how long until I know the results? I'm a little worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right. X-ray and blood work, then the muscle relaxant and warm compresses. The lab results usually come back within a couple of days, and the X-ray report typically takes 24-48 hours. My nurse will contact you as soon as the results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand your worry, Mr. Vankampen, but I don’t believe there’s cause for significant concern at this point. We are being thorough to ensure we have a clear understanding of what’s going on and to provide you with the best possible care. I'm optimistic that we can get you feeling better soon. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And for explaining everything. I just want to be able to walk again, without hurting. And maybe… spend more time with my daughter. That's all. .
