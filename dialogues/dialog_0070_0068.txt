DOCTOR: Good morning, Madame Queener. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. After the cancer, you know? They did a lot of things, and now my leg… it puffs up. It’s not painful all the time, but it's… annoying. And getting bigger, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this swelling is in your leg, and it’s developed after your cancer treatment. You feel it’s been getting progressively worse. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling, and which leg it is affecting?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice? That's a good question. Maybe… a couple of months ago? After the radiation, I think. It’s the right leg, mostly around my ankle and calf. Not the whole leg, just… that part. It goes up and down, you know? Some days it's worse than others. I don't know… is this normal? I didn't ask before. They just told me to… take pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months ago, after the radiation therapy, primarily around your right ankle and calf, and it fluctuates – some days are better than others. And which cancer were you treated for, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh… it was… breast cancer. A long time ago now, really. They caught it early, thankfully. I had surgery, and then the radiation… and pills, lots of pills. It was… a lot. But they said I was all clear. That's why I'm surprised about the swelling. Shouldn't it be… gone?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Madame Queener. It is perfectly reasonable to be surprised and worried about new symptoms after completing cancer treatment. And just to confirm, you mentioned surgery and radiation… were there any other treatments you received, such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy?
PATIENT: Chemo… yes, I had some chemo. Not much, the doctor said my type didn't need a lot. And… hormone pills, yes. Tamoxifen, I think it was called. I take them every day still. Is this swelling… because of those? Could it be something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so surgery, radiation, some chemotherapy, and currently on Tamoxifen. It’s possible the swelling could be related to the Tamoxifen, or a side effect of the radiation, or even something else entirely. It's also common to experience lymphedema after cancer treatment involving radiation or surgery, especially to the breast and axilla. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, and then I’ll need to do a quick physical exam of your leg. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Ask me whatever you need to. I just want to know what’s happening. And… is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Madame Queener. We will do our best to figure this out. I will explain everything as clearly as possible. First, let's talk about your current symptoms. Besides the swelling, have you noticed any pain, redness, warmth, or changes in the skin texture of your right leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain, not really. Sometimes it feels… tight, like my skin is stretched. But not pain. Redness, no. Warmth… maybe a little warmer than my other leg, but I'm not sure if I'm just imagining things. The skin… feels a bit harder, maybe? Not smooth like my other leg. It's hard to explain. I don't know what "texture" means exactly.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Tightness, a slight warmth, and a change in skin texture – feeling harder than your other leg. Now, outside of your right leg, have you experienced any other symptoms recently – like fatigue, weight changes, fever, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I have been a little tired lately. But I'm 59, Doctor! I always feel a bit tired. And I haven't really been eating much. Not because I don't want to, just… not hungry, I guess. No fever, though. Definitely no fever. I check myself all the time. And no weight changes, not that I've noticed. My clothes still fit.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and decreased appetite, but no fever and no noticeable weight changes. Now, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. No diabetes, no. My mother had heart problems, but I don't. And… no kidney problems, I don't think. I see the doctor regularly, and she always tells me my blood tests are fine. Just the cancer, really. That was the big thing. It feels like it’s still with me, even though they said I was better.
DOCTOR: I understand how it can feel that way, Madame Queener. It’s perfectly normal to still be aware of your body and any changes after a cancer diagnosis. And are you currently taking any medications other than Tamoxifen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, I think. And a little vitamin D, the doctor said I was low on that. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a half a sleeping pill, but not every night. Just when I really need it. Is that too many? I always forget what I'm supposed to take.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s very common to have a few different medications. Okay, so Lisinopril for blood pressure, Vitamin D, and occasional sleeping pills. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’m a bit sensitive to penicillin, I think. I had a rash once, a long time ago. But that's it. Nothing else that I know of. Is that all the questions? I'm starting to feel a little tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sensitivity to penicillin. Yes, those were all my questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Madame Queener. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your right leg. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table, and I’ll check the swelling, skin texture, and pulses in your leg. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And please, don't rush. I don't like being hurried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Madame Queener. I’m just going to take a look at your leg and feel for any differences compared to your left leg. As you mentioned, there is noticeable swelling in your right leg, particularly around the ankle and calf. The skin feels slightly thicker and harder to the touch compared to your left leg. Your pulses feel strong and regular in both legs, which is good. There's a very slight warmth to the skin on your right leg, but it's not significant. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Your reflexes are normal in both legs. Okay, that's all. Thank you for your patience. Based on my examination, it appears you have some swelling in your right leg, with some changes in skin texture. This could be due to several things, including lymphedema, a side effect of the radiation, or even something else. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few blood tests and an ultrasound of your leg. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and an ultrasound. What will the ultrasound show? And what kind of blood tests? Will they be painful? I don’t like needles. Is it… something serious, Doctor? Please, be honest with me. I just want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Madame Queener. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests and what they might show. I will be as honest and clear as possible. The ultrasound will help us visualize the blood flow and structures in your leg to see if there are any blood clots or any issues with the veins. It’s a painless procedure; a technician will just glide a wand over your skin with some gel. As for the blood tests, I want to check your kidney function, rule out any infection, and check your D-dimer level, which can indicate the presence of a blood clot. The blood draw itself might cause a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. Regarding whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say definitively. The swelling itself isn’t necessarily a sign of something life-threatening, but we need to rule out any potential complications, like a blood clot or infection. That’s why I want to do these tests. We will get the results back within a couple of days, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible, and wearing compression stockings to help reduce the swelling. Would you like me to write you a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A prescription for the stockings would be good. Elevate my leg… I can do that. And the blood tests… well, I suppose I have to. I don’t like them, but I understand. And what if it is a blood clot, Doctor? What happens then? Will I have to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried about that possibility, Madame Queener. If it turns out to be a blood clot, treatment usually involves blood thinners, either in pill form or by injection. In most cases, you wouldn't need to be hospitalized, especially if it's a small clot and detected early. However, in more severe cases, hospitalization might be necessary for more intensive treatment. We would discuss all of your options thoroughly if that were to happen. Here is the prescription for the compression stockings. It specifies the level of compression needed. Now, let’s schedule your blood tests. The clinic has a lab on-site, so it's very convenient. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that should be alright. As long as it’s not too early. Compression stockings… I hope they’re not too uncomfortable. And I really don’t want to go to the hospital. Do you think… do you think it’s probably not a blood clot? Just a little swelling from the treatment? I’m trying to stay positive, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to stay positive, Madame Queener, and that’s a very good thing. It’s certainly possible that it’s just swelling related to the radiation or a side effect of the Tamoxifen, especially since it developed after your treatment. That’s why we need to do these tests – to get a definitive answer and rule out anything more serious. We don't want to jump to conclusions without all the information. Alright, I’ve scheduled your blood tests for 9:00 am tomorrow morning. Just bring this prescription with you to the lab. They’ll take care of everything. In the meantime, remember to elevate your leg whenever you can, and try to stay as active as possible, within your comfort level. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something. I’ll see you after the tests, then. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. Thank you again, Doctor. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Madame Queener. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. And I’m hopeful it will be nothing too serious as well. Have a good day to you too, and I’ll see you tomorrow. .
