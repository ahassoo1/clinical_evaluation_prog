DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Just… flushing. It happens sometimes. My face gets really red, hot even. It’s been going on… I don't know exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Flushing, you said. A few weeks, intermittent. Can you describe exactly when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. Or when I’m doing something hard. Sometimes it just… happens. I was talking to Mrs. Gable yesterday, and it started then. And… I think when I’m a little worried, maybe? But not always when I’m worried. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be somewhat linked to stress, perhaps, but not consistently. And you haven’t noticed any specific triggers like food or exertion. Does anything relieve it, or does it just go away on its own?
PATIENT: It just… goes away. After a bit. Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes? It doesn't hurt, you see. Just… uncomfortable. Makes me feel self-conscious, talking to people. That’s why I came. I thought maybe something was wrong wrong. Like my heart or something. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all to be concerned, especially if you’re worried about your heart. We want to rule out anything serious. Do you experience any other symptoms with the flushing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe… a little bit sweaty, on my face. Just where it's red. And… sometimes my heart beats a little fast, when it's happening. But not always. I don't feel dizzy or anything like that. I sleep okay, eat okay… I am a little lonely, since my wife passed, but that's… well, that's just life, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. And I appreciate you sharing that. Okay, so flushing with possible sweating, occasional fast heartbeat, but no dizziness. Have you noticed it happening in specific locations, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random. I think. It happened at the grocery store last week. And like I said, with Mrs. Gable, we were just on the porch. Before that… I don't remember exactly. It's not like it happens every time I leave the house! I wish I could tell you more. It’s just… frustrating. It makes me not want to talk to people, and I like talking to people.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's unpredictable and impacting your social life. That’s a good thing to bring to my attention. Let's go over some other things just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always remembered those things, but I never needed much medicine. A little something for a cold sometimes, but nothing regular. And no… food allergies either. I eat most things. I like spicy food, actually! Do you need to know what I ate yesterday? Because I had a lovely curry. Perhaps that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: No, the curry isn't likely the culprit, though it sounds delicious. Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I try to stay healthy. I walk every morning, and I eat my vegetables. My wife… she always said I was stubborn about taking pills. “Too many side effects,” I’d say. She’d roll her eyes. But… I really don't take anything. Just… this flushing. It's the only thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctors always said I was very healthy, for an older man. I had a check-up last year, and they didn’t mention anything. Just the usual… cholesterol was a little high, but nothing they needed to treat right away. My wife handled all the paperwork. She was very organized. I'm… I'm probably not telling you much help, am I? I just feel warm and red sometimes.
DOCTOR: You’re telling me a lot, actually. It's helpful to know you've had generally good health and a recent check-up where nothing significant was noted. Okay, so generally healthy, slightly elevated cholesterol. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them. Just a few stitches when I was a boy, falling out of a tree. My wife used to tease me about that, too. She said I was always getting into trouble. I miss her very much. But… no surgeries. Nothing serious ever happened to me, until this. Just… the flushing. It's not dangerous, is it? That’s what I'm really worried about.
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily dangerous, but we want to understand why it’s happening. Okay, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything like skin conditions that cause redness in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father had high blood pressure, I think. He was a very… quiet man. Didn't talk much about his health. And my mother… she had some skin problems when she was older, very itchy, red patches. But nothing like this. Just… little things. My brother, he was very healthy. Never sick a day in his life. So… maybe my mother? The skin thing? It was a long time ago, I don't remember much about it. It didn’t seem very serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of high blood pressure in your father, some skin issues in your mother. Now, one last thing about your background. Can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... well, I wake up early and walk for about thirty minutes. I read the newspaper with my coffee. I live alone now, since my wife passed, but I try to stay busy. I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week. I mostly just… keep things tidy. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don't smoke. I try to eat healthy, like I said. I don't have any… stressful hobbies. Is that helpful? I'm not a very exciting man. It’s just… this flushing. It makes me feel very… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Thanks for sharing all of that. Based on what you’ve told me, and your recent check-up, there aren’t any glaring red flags. It sounds like this could be something called rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes redness and flushing, and can be triggered by stress, heat, or certain foods. It’s usually harmless, but can be uncomfortable. To be certain, though, I’d like to take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Rosacea? I’ve never heard of that. Sounds… complicated. If it’s harmless, that’s good. But it’s just… the feeling. It’s very unpleasant. Yes, Doctor, please look at my skin. I want to know what's going on. And… I hope it’s not something serious. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take a look. It’s good that you're bringing this to our attention. Please have a seat, and we’ll get started. I'm going to gently examine your face and neck. Okay, I’m noticing some redness across your cheeks and nose, and a few small, visible blood vessels. The skin feels relatively normal to the touch. No swelling or tenderness. Do you notice these blood vessels before, or is this new?
PATIENT: I... I don't know. My wife always told me I had a bit of a red face. She said it was because I was out in the sun too much when I was younger. I never really paid attention. I never noticed the little lines... before. But she... she noticed everything. She had very good eyes. I suppose they're new. I haven't looked closely at my face in a long time. I just... want it to stop. It's very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. It's very common to feel that way. Your lymph nodes feel normal, which is a good sign. Based on what I see, and your description, rosacea is still the most likely explanation. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple blood test. It will check for underlying inflammation and other conditions that can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test... yes, that's fine. If it will help, please do it. I just want to know what's going on. I don’t like not knowing. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? To… make it stop, or at least not happen so often? I have a lunch with Mrs. Gable next week, and I don't want to… scare her. She’s a very kind woman.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There are a few things you can try. Avoiding triggers like direct sun exposure, spicy foods, and alcohol can help. A gentle skincare routine with a mild cleanser and moisturizer is also beneficial. You can also try a cool compress to soothe the redness when it flares up. I'll write down some recommendations for you. I’ll also prescribe a topical cream called metronidazole. It can help reduce inflammation and redness. It’s a mild medication, but it can be quite effective. We’ll see how you respond to it, and adjust the treatment plan if needed. Here's a list of the instructions and recommendations, and the lab order. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll take care of you. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… that sounds like a complicated name. But… if it will help, I’ll try it. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for… listening to me. It’s been… a long time since I talked about something like this. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… the lab down the hall? Is it far? I don’t walk very quickly anymore. And... will the cream make my face peel? My wife always said I had sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: No, it's just down the hall, very close. And no, the metronidazole cream shouldn’t cause peeling. Some people experience mild dryness or irritation at first, but it usually goes away on its own. If you do experience any significant irritation, stop using the cream and let me know. We can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you’re responding to the treatment. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. We’re here to help. Do you think you can manage that, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. A follow-up appointment in a month… and if it gets too red, I stop the cream. I can remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You've been very… patient with me. It's just… nice to have someone listen. I miss my wife. She always knew what to do. I think that’s all. I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. And don’t worry, we'll get this under control. Have a good day, and enjoy your lunch with Mrs. Gable.
