DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Creagh. Dr. Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I've been experiencing a lot of pressure in my bladder lately, and it's… well, it's quite bothersome. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I believe.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Pressure… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes, but it’s happening more frequently now. It feels like I need to use the restroom even when I don’t, or shortly after I have used the restroom. It’s… unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Shortly after," hm. And would you describe this pressure as painful, or more of an urgent sensation?
PATIENT: It’s not exactly painful, Doctor. It's more… a very strong urge, a feeling of fullness even when I know my bladder shouldn’t be full. It’s uncomfortable, and it makes me anxious, if that makes sense. I worry about… accidents, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Accidents?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just… a little leakage sometimes, when I cough or laugh, or if I’m trying to get to the restroom quickly. It’s not a large amount, but it’s enough to be concerning, and it's impacting my daily activities. I find myself avoiding certain things, just in case.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Creagh, these things happen. It's often just a matter of…weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Have you had any children?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Two children. They were vaginal deliveries, both of them. Is that…relevant? I apologize, I don't mean to sound uninformed, but I'm not entirely sure what the pelvic floor muscles are or how that would relate to this.
DOCTOR: It's quite relevant, Ms. Creagh. Childbirth can certainly strain those muscles. Now, let's not dwell on the details. Have you tried any… exercises?
PATIENT: Exercises? No, Doctor, I haven’t. I haven’t been told about any exercises, or… well, anything I could do to help. I was hoping you could advise me on that, if that’s possible? I’m willing to try anything, truly. I just didn't know where to start.
DOCTOR: Kegels, Ms. Creagh. Simple Kegel exercises. Squeeze the muscles you use to stop urination. Hold for a few seconds, release. Repeat several times a day. It’s… common sense, really. Now, let's move on. Do you have any pain with urination?
PATIENT: I… I haven’t actively been trying to do those, Doctor. I didn’t realize that was something I should be doing on my own. I’ll certainly start now that I know. As for pain with urination, no, not really. It's not painful, but sometimes it feels… a little slow to start, if that makes sense? Like I have to… push a little bit to get things going.
DOCTOR: A little slow, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's not a sharp pain, or burning, or anything like that. Just… it doesn’t start immediately when I try to go. It feels like I need to… concentrate a bit, and sometimes strain a little to get the flow started. It’s not every time, but it happens frequently enough that it's noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any fever, chills, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no blood in my urine. I’ve been monitoring that specifically, as I was a little worried about that. Everything else feels… normal, aside from the pressure and the slow start when I urinate.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll need to do a quick examination, and then we'll get a urine sample. It's likely a mild infection, or perhaps just some residual weakness. Don't be alarmed. It's common after childbirth. Please, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds good. I appreciate you explaining everything. I’ll lie down on the examination table now. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should be doing or expecting during the examination.
DOCTOR: Just standard procedure, Ms. Creagh. Nothing to concern yourself with. I'll auscultate your abdomen, then a quick pelvic exam. It will be brief. Please relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try to relax. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pelvic exam reveals mild weakness in the pelvic floor muscles, but no other abnormalities. Now, let’s get that urine sample. There’s a cup in the restroom. Please, try to collect a mid-stream sample. And try not to contaminate it.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A mid-stream sample, and I’ll try to be careful not to contaminate it. I’ll be right back with the sample.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I did my best to collect a mid-stream sample.
DOCTOR: We'll send this off for a basic urinalysis. It's standard procedure. It should take a few days for the results. In the meantime, continue with the Kegel exercises. And drink plenty of water. Honestly, Ms. Creagh, it’s likely just a matter of strengthening those muscles. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Strengthening the muscles…that’s good to know. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any specific resources you’d recommend for learning the exercises correctly? Perhaps a brochure, or a website?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Creagh, a quick internet search will suffice. “Kegel exercises for women.” It’s hardly rocket science. Here. Several articles from reputable sources. Read those. And try to be diligent. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate… the information. No, I believe that’s all for now. I’ll read those articles and start the exercises. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor Blim.
DOCTOR: Very well. Don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if things don't improve. Good day, Ms. Creagh. .
