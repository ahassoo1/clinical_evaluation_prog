DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, I don’t have all day. I’m Angelle Shteynberg. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure it happens without any… complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. And I’d rather deal with this now than later, when things might be… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Angelle, I completely understand. Time is important, and it's smart to be proactive. So, you're hoping to get pregnant. Have you been trying for a while, or are you just starting to think about it?
PATIENT: “Trying”? No. Not exactly. I’m… preparing. I’ve been divorced for ten years, and let’s just say my previous marriage wasn’t… conducive to successful family planning. I want to be certain everything is as it should be before I even consider… well, you understand. I don't want a repeat performance. Are you going to ask me a million personal questions, or can we get to the tests?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I won't pry into things you don't want to share. We can definitely focus on tests to assess your overall health and fertility potential. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history. Right. Well, I broke my arm when I was seven, climbing a plum tree. And I had the usual childhood illnesses. Nothing… dramatic. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. Honestly, I’m very healthy for my age. I cycle – I repair bicycles, remember? It keeps me in shape. Is there a questionnaire I can fill out instead? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. A questionnaire would be helpful, yes. I’ll have my assistant bring one over. In the meantime, just to get a quick start, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. Absolutely no medications. And allergies? Just… people who waste my time. But seriously, no. Nothing. Not even hay fever. I’m very… robust. Really, I think I’m perfectly fine. This whole thing is probably unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Robust is excellent! Since you're very active and feel healthy, let’s do a basic physical exam just to confirm everything looks good. That will give us a good baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick. I have a repair waiting for me. And don’t start poking and prodding unnecessarily. I’m not here for a full physical; I’m here to ensure I can have a baby without trouble. Get in, get it done, and let's get the results.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. We’ll keep it focused and efficient. If you could change into this gown, we’ll start with your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick listen to your lungs. Then we'll do a brief abdominal exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Honestly. All this fuss. Very well. But I expect a clear explanation of what you're listening for. And don’t be alarmed if I’m… direct. I don’t have time for delicate sensibilities. Just tell me if there’s a problem. The quicker this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as we go, and I appreciate your directness. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is excellent, 128 over 76. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear and strong. No abnormalities detected there. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Palpate away. But be gentle! I need to be able to work later. Honestly, I don't see what poking my stomach has to do with anything. I cycle, remember? My core is strong. I haven’t had any pain or… issues. Just get it over with. This is all very… tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, your abdomen feels soft and there’s no tenderness. Everything feels normal there as well. Just routine, Angelle, to ensure everything is as it should be. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will check your hormone levels, blood count, and screen for any potential infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work. Fine. But I want the fastest turnaround time possible. I don’t have all day to sit around waiting for results. And I’m paying for this, you know. I expect efficiency. Do I need to fast for this? Tell me everything upfront. Don't spring surprises on me. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And you’re right to expect efficiency; I'll make sure the lab prioritizes your results. We usually get them back within 48-72 hours. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hormone panel, including FSH, LH, estradiol, and prolactin. These will give us a good baseline. Here’s the requisition form. You can take this to the lab downstairs. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else?
PATIENT: Hormone panels. Honestly. Very well. Downstairs, you say? Fine. Don’t bother explaining the details; I don't need to know what each little thing measures. Just tell me if something is wrong. And I expect a call, not an email. I don't check my email. Get it done quickly. Is that all? I have a bicycle waiting. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for today. We'll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Thank you for coming in, Angelle.
