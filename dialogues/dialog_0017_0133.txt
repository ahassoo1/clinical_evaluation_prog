DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be quick about it, I just need some papers signed. Some health forms, you know? For… well, for things. I don't really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed a doctor to verify them. Is that what you do here? Sign things? I’d really like to get this over with if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, while I can certainly review and sign forms, this practice is not solely for completing paperwork. I am a physician, and my primary concern is your health and well-being. Before I sign anything, I need to understand why these forms require my signature. It's rather… unusual to request medical verification without a proper consultation. Could you please elaborate on what “things” these forms are for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I knew I should’ve written it down. Let me think… It’s for a program. A senior assistance program. They help with… costs. You know, things get expensive. And they needed a doctor to say I’m… capable. That I’m still… you know… with it. They said something about needing proof for the funding. It’s all very confusing, honestly. I just want to be able to afford my medications. Is that enough information? I really don’t like filling out forms, and I really don’t understand most of what’s on them.
DOCTOR: Right. A senior assistance program. And they require a physician's statement of your… cognitive state and general health to qualify for funding. Very well. While I understand your aversion to paperwork, Ms. Tippens, a responsible physician cannot simply sign a form without assessing your current condition. It would be… unethical. To begin, let's start with a brief medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A history? Well… not regularly, no. I used to, when my husband was alive. He always made the appointments. After he passed… it just sort of fell by the wayside. It’s been… a while. Maybe five years? Longer? I mostly just go when something’s really wrong. And I try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables. Mostly. I walk when the weather’s nice. Is that good enough? I don’t have a lot of money for doctor visits, you see. That’s part of why I need this program.
DOCTOR: Five years or longer since a comprehensive medical exam. I see. And you've experienced no significant illnesses or hospitalizations in that time?
PATIENT: Well… there was that time I fell last winter. Slipped on the ice coming home from the market. Broke my wrist. Had to go to the emergency room, got it in a cast. Other than that… no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? Arthritis, mostly. And a bad back. I take some things for it, but they don't always help. Is that what you’re asking about? Big things? Because if it's just little things, there's a lot. But I don’t want to bore you with the details.
DOCTOR: A fractured wrist requiring emergency room treatment is certainly not a “little thing,” Ms. Tippens. It’s important to have a complete picture of your medical background. Do you recall the name of the hospital where you received treatment for the fracture?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, names… I’m terrible with names. Let me think… it was the big one downtown. St. Jude’s, I think? Yes, that sounds right. St. Jude’s Hospital. It was very busy, lots of waiting. They took good care of me, though. The doctors were nice. I had to go back a few times for check-ups, but it healed okay. I still get a little stiffness in it sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Is that helpful? I’m trying my best to remember everything. It’s been a long time, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. St. Jude’s. Now, Ms. Tippens, before I can complete these forms, I need to ask about your current medications. Can you tell me everything you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a lot. Let me see… For my arthritis, I take… Ibuprofen, usually. When it’s really bad. And there's something else… a little white pill. I think it’s for my back. My neighbor gave it to me, actually. She said it helps her. I don't remember the name. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little bit of… NyQuil, I think? Just the nighttime one. And I take a vitamin… a multivitamin. Old people are supposed to take those, aren’t they? I can’t remember everything exactly. It’s all mixed up in my head. I keep a little bottle in the kitchen, but I don’t really keep track of what I take anymore. It’s all just… when something hurts.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, receiving medication from a neighbor is… highly discouraged. And taking medications without proper knowledge of dosage and potential interactions is… frankly, irresponsible. I need to understand exactly what you are taking. Do you have any of these medications with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I didn't think to bring them. I just told you what I remembered. I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it was so important. I just thought you needed a signature on the forms. I really don’t like making a fuss. And I’m starting to feel a little… flustered. Maybe I should just go? I can ask my neighbor for the name of the pill. Is that okay? I just want to get this over with. I have an appointment later, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, “getting this over with” is not a substitute for a proper medical assessment. I cannot ethically complete these forms without a clear understanding of your medical history and current medications. Your casual approach to your health is… concerning. Before I can proceed, I need to conduct a brief physical examination. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A physical examination? Well… I suppose so. But I’m not very good with doctors. They always poke and prod. And I get nervous. It makes my blood pressure go up, you know? And I don’t like being touched. But… if you have to, I guess. Just… be gentle, please? And don't take too long. I really do have that appointment later. And I get cold easily. Could we do it quickly? I just want to get this over with. Honestly, I’m not feeling very well just thinking about it. Perhaps we should just forget the whole thing. I'll just figure something else out. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your apprehension. However, a basic examination is necessary to ensure I can responsibly complete these forms. If you are truly unwilling to cooperate, I cannot proceed. Given your stated discomfort and reluctance, I recommend you consult with another physician who may be better suited to address your concerns. I am not comfortable providing a medical assessment under these circumstances. I wish you the best of luck in finding a healthcare provider who can meet your needs. Good day.
