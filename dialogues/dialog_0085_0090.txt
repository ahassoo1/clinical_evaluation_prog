DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Lahn. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to get cleared for it, I believe. It's... cosmetic. I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the specifics right away.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright. We'll take our time and get everything sorted out. A cosmetic surgery clearance – okay. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about the surgery you’re planning?
PATIENT: It… involves my face, I believe. It was… something my husband and I discussed for a long time. He always thought I deserved it. It’s… difficult to explain. It's not a major reconstruction, not like after an accident, you understand. More… refining, perhaps? He did most of the research and spoke with the surgeon. I’m afraid I wasn’t terribly involved in the details, and… well, things have been a bit hazy since. I truly apologize for being so vague. Is it alright if I just say it’s a facial aesthetic procedure?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. “Facial aesthetic procedure” is perfectly fine. No need to apologize at all. It sounds like your husband was very supportive, and it's okay that you weren't directly involved in all the details. We can definitely work with that. To help me understand what kind of clearance you need, could you tell me the name of the surgeon, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. The name is on the tip of my tongue… Dr… something Ramirez? Or was it… Gonzalez? It was a Spanish name, definitely. He had a practice in the city, I believe. He was very highly recommended. I'm so sorry, this is truly frustrating. I should remember this. Perhaps the paperwork from the surgeon's office will have the information?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. These things happen. Don’t worry about it. We can certainly look at the paperwork when you have it. Let’s focus on what you need from me for this clearance. Generally, I'll want to review your medical history, do a brief physical exam, and possibly order some labs, depending on the nature of the procedure. First, let’s start with your past medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I believe I was told I had slightly elevated cholesterol at one point, but it was managed with diet, I think. No diabetes, no heart problems. I had asthma as a child, but it hasn’t bothered me in years – not since I moved to a drier climate. And… no, I don’t think there's anything else major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. I generally consider myself to be quite healthy, actually. Aside from… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No… not really. Aside from… well, the emergency C-section with my son, many years ago. He was… a bit early. It was… complicated, but I recovered well, thankfully. And… no, nothing else. No other surgeries, no hospital stays. It was quite a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mackenzi. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, as recommended by my previous doctor. Just as a preventative measure. And… sometimes, I take ibuprofen for occasional headaches, but not very often. And… that’s it, I believe. No other medications or supplements. Just the aspirin, most days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat… most things, without issue. No known drug allergies either. I've been very lucky in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, had heart disease. He passed away when I was quite young. My father… he was generally healthy, I think. No cancer, no diabetes, as far as I know. It’s… difficult to recall precisely. We weren’t a very close family, so I don’t have a lot of information about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, I spend most of my time outdoors. I work in landscaping and groundskeeping, so I’m very active. Lots of walking, lifting, bending… It’s hard work, but I enjoy it. I eat reasonably well, mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to stay healthy, as you can imagine, for my work. I live a quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mackenzi. It sounds like you take very good care of yourself. Now, to get a better idea of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor Lahn. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal and neurological exam. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given your activity level. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Okay, everything seems to be within normal limits. Your vital signs are a little elevated, as expected with your work, but no major concerns.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor Lahn. Thank you. I was a little worried, but I suppose my work does tend to get my heart racing sometimes. So… what does this mean, for the surgery clearance? Do you need to order any further tests?
DOCTOR: Given your overall health and the results of the physical exam, I don’t think extensive testing is necessary at this point. However, to be thorough, I would like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count . The BMP will give us a snapshot of your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar, and the CBC will check your red and white blood cell counts. This is just a standard precaution before any elective procedure. Do you have any known kidney issues or a history of anemia that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any problems with my kidneys. And no, I don’t think I’ve ever been anemic. I… sometimes feel a little tired, but I just assumed it was from the work. I truly apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could remember more details. It’s just… a bit of a blur, everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Mackenzi. These things happen, and it’s perfectly alright. We'll get all the information we need. Okay, I’ll order the BMP and CBC. They can be done at the lab just down the street. It’s best to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw, so schedule it for first thing in the morning. Once the results come back, we can discuss them and determine if you’re cleared for the procedure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor Lahn. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate it. First thing in the morning sounds good. Would you mind if I asked… approximately how long do you think it will take to get the results back? I have a… consultation scheduled with the surgeon soon, and I'd like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Typically, the results are back within 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. If you haven’t heard from us within 48 hours, please don’t hesitate to give the office a call. To recap, we’ve ordered a BMP and CBC, and you’ll need to fast beforehand. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them and determine if you’re cleared for your facial aesthetic procedure. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor Lahn. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything so clearly. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you… for listening. It’s been… difficult, adjusting to everything. I believe that’s all. I’ll go and schedule the lab work now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, take care of yourself. I’ll see you back here once the lab results are in. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Lahn. You as well. .
