DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder, please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. Feels queasy a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I get full. It’s just… not right. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. "Queasy" and feeling full quickly. And you say this has been going on for “a little while.” Can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… well, let me think. It started… around springtime, maybe? Or was it after Easter? I do remember things being green… and warm. Before that, I felt alright, I think. I bake a lot for the community, you see, and I wasn't having trouble with my appetite then. But after… well, it just seemed to go downhill. It’s hard to say exactly when, though. A few months, maybe? I really don’t keep track of dates very well these days. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A few months. Alright. And besides the nausea and feeling full quickly, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but honestly, at my age, who doesn't? I do have a little trouble sleeping sometimes, too. But that's been going on for years. Oh! And… my appetite just isn’t what it used to be, even before I get full quickly. I used to love a good meal, but now… food just doesn't seem as appealing. I've lost a little weight, I think, but I haven't weighed myself recently. Everything feels a bit… off, generally. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, and some weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh my. Bowel habits… Well, now that you mention it… they haven't been as regular, I suppose. More…constipated, maybe? It’s not something I usually think about, to be honest. I try to drink plenty of water, but… it’s still a bit difficult sometimes. Sorry, that’s probably not very helpful. It’s just… private, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s important information. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! No blood, thank the Lord. And no… no pain, exactly. Just… discomfort, sometimes. A little bloated feeling, maybe? Especially after I do manage to eat something. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uneasy. It comes and goes, really. It’s hard to describe. I haven’t been wanting to eat much anyway, so I haven’t paid it much mind. Does that make sense? I just figured it was my age, or something I ate.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood, just discomfort and bloating. Any unintentional weight loss, can you estimate how much weight you’ve lost?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Weight loss… I used to be a good bit heavier, I reckon. Maybe… five, ten pounds? It’s hard to say. My clothes are a little looser, I suppose. I haven’t really been trying to lose weight, though. It just sort of happened. I don't weigh myself regularly, like I said. I used to, but… it just became another thing I forgot to do. I mostly notice it in my rings, they’re a bit loose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your abdomen and feel for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Yes. I do trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My joints aren’t as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but there's some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. No masses are palpable. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are within normal limits. I'll need to access your EHR to see your past medical history. Just a moment. Ah, I see here you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication. And some mild osteoarthritis. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure. Always has been a bit high. And the arthritis… it flares up in the cold weather. Makes my hands ache. Allergies… let me think. Not to anything specific, I don't believe. I can eat anything, thankfully. Never had any trouble with food. Though, I do get a bit gassy sometimes, if I eat too many beans. Is that considered an allergy? I don't think so. Just an old lady's tummy, probably.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. You mentioned you take medication for hypertension. Can you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me see… it’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘P’? I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street, and they put it in a little bottle for me. I just take one every morning, with my breakfast. I’m afraid I’m not very good with names of things. I leave that to the professionals, you see. I just know it keeps my blood pressure in check. Would it be alright if I had my daughter, Sarah, call the pharmacy to get the exact name? She’s much better at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be helpful. We can wait while you contact her. In the meantime, given your symptoms – nausea, early satiety, decreased appetite, some weight loss, constipation, and a history of hypertension – I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a side effect of your hypertension medication, although it’s not common. It could also be something more serious, like gastritis or even a more significant gastrointestinal issue. To be thorough, I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. I also think it would be wise to consider an upper endoscopy, but let’s start with the initial tests first. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… complicated. Gastritis? Endoscopy? It all sounds rather scary. I… I just want to feel better. Is it something serious, Doctor? Do you think it's cancer? I've lost a few friends to cancer lately, and it makes me worry. I’m not sure I understand all of those tests. What will they involve? And… will they hurt? I'm a bit frail, you see. I just want to know what we’re dealing with, and what I need to do. Would it be alright if I brought Sarah with me next time? She’s a nurse, and she can help me understand everything.
DOCTOR: Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions. It’s far too early to be talking about cancer. It's important to be thorough, and these tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. A complete blood count will check for anemia or infection. A metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, and electrolyte balance. The stool test checks for any abnormalities. As for the endoscopy, it involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining. It’s a relatively painless procedure, you’ll receive sedation to keep you comfortable. It's standard practice for investigating these types of symptoms. Yes, bringing your daughter next time is perfectly acceptable. She can certainly ask any questions you have. For now, let's get these initial tests scheduled. The nurse will draw your blood and give you instructions for the stool sample. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… somewhat reassuring, I suppose. The sedation sounds good. I do worry about pain, you see. And… the stool sample… is it… difficult? I feel a bit embarrassed to ask. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a quilting circle next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. It’s the one bright spot in my week. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It’s a lot to take in, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. I think Sarah will be a great help.
DOCTOR: The stool sample is quite straightforward, the nurse will provide you with a kit and instructions. It's just a collection, nothing invasive. The results usually take about 5-7 business days, but we'll contact you as soon as they’re available. As for missing your quilting circle, let’s hope that’s not necessary. We’ll proceed as quickly as possible. I'm going to write up the orders for the lab tests now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the necessary instructions. Do you have any other concerns at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. 5-7 business days… I’ll try not to worry too much. I think… that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I do get flustered easily. I just want to feel like myself again. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Mrs. Kelder.
