DOCTOR: Hi Denis, welcome. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter regarding some results from a test… a GI Endo Test, they called it. It indicated some… abnormalities, and I was advised to come in for a discussion. Honestly, I wasn’t entirely certain what it meant, but I wanted to understand what’s going on, if you don't mind explaining it to me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Denis. It’s perfectly understandable to feel a little unsure after receiving results like that. We’ll go through everything together, and I'll do my best to explain it in a way that makes sense. Okay, I see here you had a GI endoscopy performed recently. Before we dive into the results, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. It’s difficult to describe precisely. A sort of… burning sensation, primarily in my upper abdomen, and a feeling of fullness even after eating very little. It wasn’t constant, but it was becoming more frequent, and… unpleasant. My previous doctor suggested the endoscopy to investigate the cause. He thought it might be an ulcer, perhaps? Though I confess, I didn’t fully grasp all the details at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Denis. So, burning sensation and early fullness – those are definitely symptoms we need to explore. And your previous doctor suspected an ulcer, which is a reasonable starting point. When did this burning sensation and fullness begin?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it started sometime in late February, perhaps early March of this year. It was very mild at first, easily dismissed. I attributed it to something I ate, or perhaps just… indigestion. But it gradually worsened over the following weeks. By April, it was becoming noticeable enough to cause some concern. And, of course, by May it was… well, persistent enough to warrant a visit to the doctor. I am usually quite good with remembering dates, you see. My husband… he always said I had a remarkable memory.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to recall that timeline, Denis. That’s very helpful. And it sounds like it progressed gradually, which is important information. I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It’s understandable that things might feel a little more difficult right now. Now, back to the symptoms. Has anything specific made the burning sensation worse?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It has been… some time. As for what makes it worse… certain foods, definitely. Spicy foods are particularly troublesome. And anything acidic – citrus fruits, tomatoes… even coffee can aggravate it. Also, when I lie down flat after eating, the sensation seems to intensify. It's not constant discomfort, but those things reliably make it more pronounced. It's… a rather unpleasant experience, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spicy foods, acidic foods, and lying down flat after eating seem to be triggers. That’s very consistent with some of the things we see with stomach issues. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the burning and fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Occasionally, I’ve experienced some… nausea. Not severe vomiting, but a general feeling of sickness to my stomach. And a slight loss of appetite, though that could be due to the discomfort, of course. Oh, and… there have been a few instances of… a strange taste in my mouth. A slightly metallic taste, mostly after eating. It doesn't happen every time, but it's noticeable when it does. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, that’s all relevant information, thank you. Nausea, loss of appetite, and that metallic taste are things we should definitely explore. The metallic taste is interesting. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. I have. For the past few months, I’ve noticed… a bit of irregularity. Sometimes I experience constipation, and other times… the opposite. It's not severe, but it is a change from my usual routine. I had always had… regular habits, you see. This has been… unsettling, to say the least. It's rather difficult to discuss, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Denis. These things are important to discuss, and you’re doing the right thing by letting me know. It's very common for digestive issues to affect bowel habits, so it’s good you brought that up. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for many years now. Other than that… I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses, no surgeries… just the usual minor ailments one expects with age. I did have a bout of influenza a few years back, but nothing serious. I believe that’s all. And, of course, my husband… he always insisted on regular checkups, so I’ve always been diligent about maintaining my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so well-controlled hypertension is the only significant medical history. That’s good to know. And you’ve been diligent about checkups, which is excellent. Are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, as you know, for my blood pressure. And I also take a daily multivitamin, just to supplement my diet. Other than those two… no, that's it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, you see. I believe in a healthy diet and regular exercise as the best form of preventative care.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know. And I agree, a healthy lifestyle is incredibly important. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don't. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I’m aware. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no environmental allergies… I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. My husband used to joke that I was immune to everything!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Denis. No known allergies is very helpful to know. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground. Now, let's talk about the endoscopy results. I have them here on the computer. What the doctor found was some inflammation in your stomach and duodenum – that's the first part of your small intestine. He also took some biopsies, which are small tissue samples, to examine under a microscope. The biopsy results showed… Helicobacter pylori infection. Have you ever heard of that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Helicobacter pylori… it sounds… foreign. Is it… serious? What does it mean? I confess, I am rather unfamiliar with such medical terms. I am used to hearing about things like… the flu, or high blood pressure, but this is entirely new to me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay not to be familiar with it, Denis. Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, is a type of bacteria that infects the stomach. It's actually very common – millions of people have it. It's often contracted in childhood. The infection can cause inflammation and irritation of the stomach lining, which explains the symptoms you've been experiencing – the burning, fullness, nausea. In some cases, if left untreated, it can lead to ulcers or even, rarely, stomach cancer. But the good news is, it's very treatable with a course of antibiotics and other medications. We caught it, and we can address it. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that… does make a degree of sense, Doctor. So, the bacteria is causing the discomfort? And the antibiotics will… eliminate it? It’s… a relief to know it’s treatable, certainly. I was quite worried it might be something more… serious. Is the treatment… unpleasant? I've always been a bit sensitive to medications. And how long will it take? I am able to manage my schedule, but I prefer to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear it’s a relief to know it’s treatable, Denis. The antibiotics will target and eliminate the bacteria. The treatment usually involves a combination of two or three antibiotics, along with a medication called a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which helps reduce stomach acid while the infection is being treated. It's typically a 14-day course. Some people experience mild side effects, like nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. However, these are usually manageable. We can discuss strategies to minimize them, such as taking the medications with food or adjusting the timing. The PPI can sometimes cause some constipation, so we can also talk about ways to counteract that if it happens. It's important to complete the full course of treatment, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. After the treatment, we'll do a follow-up test to confirm the H. pylori is gone. Does that sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds manageable, Doctor. A 14-day course… I can certainly arrange my schedule to accommodate that. And I appreciate you explaining the potential side effects, and offering strategies to mitigate them. It's reassuring to know you've anticipated those possibilities. One question, if you don't mind. Is this… contagious? I have a few friends I see regularly, and I wouldn't want to… inadvertently transmit anything to them.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Denis. While H. pylori can be spread from person to person, it's not as easily contagious as something like the common cold. It’s usually spread through close contact with contaminated bodily fluids – like saliva, vomit, or stool. The risk of transmission is relatively low with normal social interactions, especially if good hygiene practices are followed – like washing hands thoroughly after using the restroom, and not sharing utensils or personal items. Since you're being treated, the bacteria will be eliminated, and you’ll no longer be contagious. It’s unlikely you’ve already transmitted it to your friends, but you can certainly mention it to them and encourage them to talk to their doctors if they have any concerns. Does that alleviate your worries?
PATIENT: Yes, that does alleviate my worries considerably, Doctor. Knowing it’s not highly contagious, and that I’ll no longer be a risk once the treatment begins… that is a great comfort. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, and for answering all my questions with such patience. I feel much more informed and… hopeful now. If you don’t mind, I think I’m ready to discuss the specifics of the treatment plan. When can we start?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Excellent. We can start the treatment right away. I’ll prescribe a combination of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole – that’s the PPI I mentioned earlier. You'll take two amoxicillin tablets, two clarithromycin tablets, and one omeprazole tablet twice a day for 14 days. It's important to take all the medications as prescribed, even if you start feeling better, and to finish the entire course. You may experience some nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset, so I recommend taking the medications with food, and drinking plenty of fluids. I’ll also give you a prescription for a probiotic to help restore your gut flora while you’re on the antibiotics. Are you allergic to any of these medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not allergic to any of those. I've taken amoxicillin before, for a minor infection a few years back, and I had no adverse reaction. I am unfamiliar with clarithromycin, but I have no known allergies that would preclude its use. Just one more question, if you don't mind. Will this… affect my other medications? I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as you know, and I wouldn't want any interactions.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Denis. Always good to be thorough. Okay, according to this database, there are no significant interactions between Lisinopril, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, or omeprazole. However, clarithromycin can sometimes slightly increase the levels of Lisinopril in your blood, which could potentially lead to a small drop in blood pressure. It’s unlikely to be significant, but I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home while you’re on the treatment, and letting me know if you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness. Otherwise, there are no other major concerns. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. My husband… he insisted on it, after my diagnosis. I check it regularly, as he always encouraged. I can certainly continue to do so while on the treatment, and I will report any changes to you immediately. Thank you again for your thoroughness and patience, Doctor. I feel much more confident now, and ready to begin the treatment. I appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any specific instructions I should follow?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad you’re feeling more confident. Your husband sounds like a very wise man. The main things to remember are to take all the medications as prescribed, with food, and to complete the full 14-day course, even if you start feeling better. Monitor your blood pressure at home, and let me know if you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness. Drink plenty of fluids, and try to eat a healthy diet. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks after you finish the treatment, to confirm the H. pylori is gone. We’ll do a simple stool test to check for the bacteria. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. Everything is very clearly explained, and I appreciate you providing such detailed instructions. A stool test in two weeks… that sounds perfectly reasonable. I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your kindness and patience, Doctor DeCosta. You have put my mind at ease, and I am truly grateful. I believe I’ll head to the pharmacy now, to pick up the medication. Have a lovely afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Take care, and have a lovely afternoon as well.
