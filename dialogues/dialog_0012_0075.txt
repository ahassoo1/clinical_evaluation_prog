DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Doctor Yoshino. Well, it's this tiredness, you see. Daytime tiredness. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for sleep apnea, they told me – and it helps with the snoring, definitely. My ex-wife is very grateful for that, believe me! But I still feel…drowsy during the day. It's just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to start with. So the CPAP machine is helping with the snoring, which is excellent. But you’re still experiencing daytime drowsiness despite using it. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not like I’m falling asleep everywhere, mind you. It's more… a heavy feeling. Like I haven't quite had enough sleep, even after a full night. It makes it hard to concentrate, especially in the afternoons. I used to be able to read for hours, you know? Now, I find myself rereading the same paragraph several times. And sometimes, just… a lack of motivation. It’s difficult to explain. It's just… not being quite sharp, if you understand. I teach, you see, and I want to be at my best for my students.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Moshe. That sounds really frustrating, especially when it’s affecting things you enjoy and your work. A heavy feeling, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of motivation… those are all important clues. Let’s try to get a better picture of this. When did you first start noticing this tiredness, even with the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I started using the machine, oh, about six months ago, maybe a little more. At first, I was just so relieved to not be sawing logs all night! My ex-wife confirmed that was a significant improvement. But after a month or so, I realized the tiredness hadn’t completely gone away. It’s been… pretty consistent since then, I’d say. Not getting worse, thankfully, but definitely not improving much either. Six months, give or take a few weeks, I believe. I keep pretty good track of things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Moshe. And it’s good you’re so aware of these changes. So, six months of consistent daytime drowsiness despite CPAP use. Now, besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms. Well, I’ve been a bit… irritable, perhaps. Not with anyone in particular, just… quicker to get frustrated, I suppose. And my memory… well, it’s not what it used to be, naturally, at my age! But I feel like it’s been a little worse lately, even accounting for getting older. I sometimes forget names, or where I put my glasses – which is a daily occurrence, to be honest. Oh, and I’ve had a few headaches, mostly in the mornings. Not terrible, just a dull ache. I thought it might be the mask being too tight, but I adjusted it, and it hasn't made much difference. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Moshe. Irritability, some memory issues – which you rightly point out are common with age, but worth noting – and morning headaches. Okay. To get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but no problems since then. High blood pressure, diagnosed about ten years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And… oh, I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Apart from that, nothing major. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I used to walk a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, so that’s slowed down considerably. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though I do have a sweet tooth. I’m afraid I can’t resist a good pastry! Does that cover it? I’m a fairly open book, if you need to know anything else.
DOCTOR: That’s a good overview, Moshe. No major issues, well-controlled blood pressure, and you maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle despite the sweet tooth – which is perfectly fine! Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, you know, for older folks. Nothing else. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re particularly sore, but not regularly. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. I try to avoid it when I can, but sometimes it’s necessary. I keep a list, actually, if you’d like to see it. It’s in my wallet, right here.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Moshe, thank you. I appreciate you being so organized. Let's take a look at that list. Okay, great. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Just the gallbladder, Doctor. Nothing else. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course, but that was… well, a very long time ago! I've been fairly lucky, all things considered. No broken bones, no serious accidents. I've always been a cautious person, I suppose. I don't take unnecessary risks. And I've always been careful about my health. I go for regular check-ups, and I try to follow my doctor's advice. Is there anything else I can tell you? I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very thorough history, Moshe. Thank you. Let's talk about your family history now. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. Let me think… My father had heart disease, he passed away when he was in his late 70s. My mother had diabetes, but it was well-controlled for many years. My older brother has arthritis, and my sister… she has high blood pressure, like me. And my ex-wife’s mother had Alzheimer’s, which is… concerning, of course. Apart from that, nothing major that I can think of. There were a few cases of asthma on my mother’s side, but nothing close enough to worry about, I think. Is that helpful? It’s difficult to remember everything, you know, after all these years.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Moshe. Heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and a family history of Alzheimer's. That gives me a good picture. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I’ve been divorced for… oh, almost thirty years now. We remained amicable, thankfully. My children are grown up and have families of their own, they live in different states. I see them when I can, but it’s not as often as I’d like. I keep busy, though. I used to teach at the university, but I’m retired now. I do some volunteer work at the local library, and I enjoy reading, of course. And I try to stay active, even though my knees aren’t what they used to be. I have a few friends, and we get together occasionally for coffee or lunch. I’m not lonely, if that’s what you’re asking. I keep myself occupied. Is that sufficient? I’m a fairly simple man, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Moshe. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, to finish up the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat whatever I want, which is… a blessing and a curse, considering my sweet tooth! I haven’t had any problems with insect bites or pollen, or anything like that. I’ve always been fairly lucky, in that regard. I think that covers everything, Doctor. I’ve tried to be as thorough as possible. I want to help you figure out what’s going on, so I’ve told you everything I could think of. Do you have any other questions for me?
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very comprehensive history, Moshe. Thank you for being so thorough and open with me. It’s incredibly helpful. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then I’ll do a brief neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do, I'm happy to cooperate. I'm used to doctor's visits, you know, at my age! I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I trust your judgment completely. Go ahead, whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. I heard a mild heart murmur, which we’ll want to keep an eye on, but it doesn’t sound concerning at this point. Your lungs sound good, and your neurological exam is normal. Now, based on your history and this brief exam, I have a few ideas about what might be causing your tiredness. It could be related to sleep apnea, even though the CPAP machine is helping with the snoring. Sometimes, it takes time to find the right settings, and even with treatment, some people still experience daytime fatigue. It could also be related to your blood pressure, even though it’s currently well-controlled. Or, it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests are no problem at all. I've had plenty of those over the years. Whatever you think is best, I trust your judgment. Thyroid, Vitamin D, the whole thing… go right ahead. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling like myself again. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Fasting, or anything like that? I’m happy to follow your instructions. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and investigate this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. I’m glad I can help. For these tests, I would like you to fast for 12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks, except for water. We'll schedule those first thing tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms or if your tiredness gets significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And if you have any questions about the tests or anything else, feel free to give us a call as well. Once we get the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Fasting for 12 hours, no problem. I’m used to it. And I will definitely call if anything changes, or if things get worse. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. And I will look forward to the follow-up appointment. Thank you again for your time and attention, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve put my mind at ease already. I think that’s everything for today, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today, Moshe. Just the lab work tomorrow morning. We'll get those results back quickly, and we'll go from there. Here’s a lab requisition form and instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. Have a good rest of your day, Moshe. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. It was a pleasure meeting you.
