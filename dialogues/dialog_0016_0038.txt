DOCTOR: Hi Evann, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Maskal. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I scheduled an appointment regarding… planning for the future, if you will. Something about forms… advance directives, perhaps? My memory isn’t what it once was, I’m afraid, and I wanted to ensure everything is in order.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Evann. Advance care planning is a very responsible thing to do. It is about making sure your wishes are known, just in case. And it’s common for things to slip our minds – that’s what we’re here for! I see here you’re interested in a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. Is that correct?
PATIENT: A… living will? And… durable power… Yes, those terms sound familiar. I suppose so. I was advised to complete these by… someone. A friend, perhaps? Honestly, Dr. Maskal, the details are quite hazy. I simply want to be prepared, and I understand these documents facilitate that. Could you perhaps explain what they do, in simpler terms?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. Let’s start with a living will. Think of it as a written statement of what medical care you want – or don't want – if you were ever unable to speak for yourself. Things like whether you'd want to be kept alive on a ventilator, or if you’d want aggressive measures taken to prolong your life, even if recovery isn’t likely. A durable power of attorney for healthcare is who you choose to make those decisions for you if you can't. It’s a trusted person – a family member, a friend – who knows your values and wishes. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes… that clarifies things somewhat. So, the living will is the what, and the power of attorney is the who. I think I’m following. It’s… unsettling to consider, naturally. Choosing what care one doesn’t want… and entrusting such a weighty decision to another person. It’s… a lot to process. Would it be possible to perhaps have an example of each? To better understand the wording, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s a very reasonable request, and it’s good you’re thinking through this carefully. It is a lot. Here are some sample forms, and this booklet has examples of common wishes people express. We can go through them together, or you can take them home and read through them at your own pace. Before we dive into the forms, though, let me ask a few questions to get a better sense of your overall health. Just routine things. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Maskal. That is very helpful. I appreciate your patience. Significant medical conditions… let me see. I had a rather severe bout of pneumonia several years ago, but I believe I made a full recovery. And… I’ve always struggled with low blood pressure, but it’s never required any ongoing treatment. Beyond that… nothing immediately springs to mind. My memory, as I mentioned, is… unreliable. I often forget routine doctor’s appointments, even. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. It's perfectly fine. We’ll take things at your pace. Pneumonia a few years ago, low blood pressure… good to know. And that’s helpful about the memory lapses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… yes, actually. When I was quite young – perhaps ten or twelve – I had my tonsils removed. A fairly routine procedure, I believe. And… I think I had my appendix removed as well, many years later. But it was so long ago, and the details are… blurred. I truly apologize for my inability to provide more precise information. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Evann. It’s not a problem at all. Tonsils and appendix removed… I've made a note of that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't believe so. As far as I am aware, I have never experienced any allergic reactions to food, medications, or… anything else, for that matter. I can confidently say I have no known allergies. Though, I suppose one can develop new sensitivities at any time… I do tend to get hives if exposed to very cold temperatures, but I wouldn’t classify that as a true allergy. It’s more of an… irritation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just hives with cold exposure. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as advised by a previous physician, for… preventative measures, I believe. And occasionally, when I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. Beyond that… no, I don’t regularly take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements. I try to maintain a healthy diet, so I generally don’t feel the need. Though, I do enjoy a cup of chamomile tea before bed, if that counts. It’s more for relaxation than anything else.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Evann. Low-dose aspirin daily and ibuprofen as needed. Chamomile tea doesn’t count! Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult question, Dr. Maskal. My family… we weren’t particularly close. We didn’t discuss medical matters openly. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, quite severely, in her later years. And my father… I believe he had heart problems, though I don’t recall the specifics. Beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much information. It’s a rather… vague recollection, I’m afraid. It’s frustrating, as I understand the importance of knowing one’s family history.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s common for that information to be limited. Arthritis and heart problems – good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I have never smoked, nor do I drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs. I consider those habits… detrimental to one’s health. I maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I enjoy walking, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Though, I must admit, I do have a fondness for sweets. Perhaps too much of a fondness.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Evann. Walking and a relatively healthy diet are excellent. And a little indulgence is fine! Okay, last few questions before we move onto a quick physical exam. What is your current occupation, and would you describe your living situation as stressful?
PATIENT: My occupation… I am an etcher and engraver. I create detailed designs on metal plates. It requires a steady hand and a great deal of patience. As for my living situation… I live alone in a small cottage outside of town. It’s peaceful, but… It can be isolating at times, yes. And the… divorce was rather difficult, several years ago. I wouldn’t describe it as stressful now, but the lingering effects… occasionally surface. It’s… manageable, though. I prefer solitude, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, etcher and engraver, living alone in a cottage. I appreciate your honesty about the divorce. It's understandable that would have lasting effects. Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam – just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Dr. Maskal. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I understand the importance of a thorough examination. I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 118/72, which is excellent. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Another deep breath… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Ears appear clear as well. And finally, let’s take a quick look at your throat… say “Ah” for me. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Overall, your physical exam appears normal. No immediate concerns detected. Everything sounds and looks good. Now, back to those advance directives… would you like me to go through some sample forms with you, or would you prefer to take them home and review them at your own pace?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Dr. Maskal. Thank you. I believe… I would appreciate it if you could go through some of the sample forms with me, if you have the time. Perhaps just a brief overview of each section? I find it easier to understand things when they are explained directly. I’m afraid I’m rather hesitant to tackle it alone, given my… memory issues. I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: No inconvenience at all, Evann. That’s exactly what I’m here for. Alright, let’s start with the Living Will. This form is essentially a declaration of your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, resuscitation… Here, you can specify whether you want these interventions withheld or withdrawn in certain situations. It’s broken down into categories – terminal illness, permanent unconsciousness, and so on. The next section focuses on pain management. You can express your preferences for how your pain should be treated, even if it means potentially shortening your life. Do you have any initial questions about the Living Will?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… artificial nutrition… those terms sound rather… daunting, to be honest. If I were to become permanently unconscious, for example… I suppose I would not want to be kept alive artificially. Prolonging suffering… that seems… undesirable. But if there was even a possibility of recovery… I would want every effort made, naturally. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? And the pain management section… I would want to be comfortable, certainly. But I’m hesitant to specify a preference that might… hasten my demise. It’s… a lot to consider. I apologize for my hesitation. It’s simply… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Evann. It is overwhelming. And you’re not alone in feeling that way. It’s okay to take your time and think through each section carefully. You're asking the right questions, and it's good you're thinking about these nuances. See this section here?
PATIENT: Yes, I see it… “Do Not Resuscitate Order”. Is that a directive indicating I would not wish to be revived in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest? That feels… rather drastic. But I understand it’s about respecting my wishes. It’s simply… a difficult concept to grapple with. Is it… common for people to include such a directive? Or is it reserved for those with… serious underlying health conditions? I apologize for my incessant questioning. It’s simply… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all. Your questions are thoughtful and important. And it's good you’re asking them. A Do Not Resuscitate, or DNR, order is something people consider for various reasons, not just serious health conditions. Some people prefer a natural death, without aggressive interventions. Others may feel that resuscitation would only prolong suffering without offering a meaningful recovery. It’s a very personal decision, and it’s perfectly acceptable to not include a DNR order if you’re unsure. It’s more important to focus on what you do want, rather than what you don’t. Let’s move on to the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. This form is about choosing someone to make medical decisions for you if you become unable to do so yourself. This is just as important as the Living Will. Do you have someone in mind?
PATIENT: A Durable Power of Attorney… That’s… a difficult question, Dr. Maskal. My divorce… it was rather amicable, but my ex-husband and I… we aren’t close. I have… few close friends. And my family… well, as we discussed, we weren’t particularly close. I suppose I don’t have anyone I would explicitly trust with such a weighty responsibility. It’s… a daunting thought. Would it be possible to appoint a… professional advocate? Or perhaps a representative from the clinic? I apologize for my hesitation. It’s simply… a difficult situation.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s not uncommon for people to struggle with choosing a healthcare proxy. It’s a very important decision, and you shouldn't feel pressured to choose someone you don't fully trust. Appointing a professional advocate or a clinic representative is possible, though there are often limitations. They may not be as familiar with your personal values and preferences as someone you know. And there can be legal and ethical considerations. Before we explore those options further, let’s think about anyone – even someone you haven't spoken to recently – who you believe understands your wishes and would advocate for your best interests. Perhaps a former colleague, a distant relative, or even a close friend from years past?
PATIENT: No… I’m afraid not, Dr. Maskal. I’ve… always been rather independent. I don’t rely on others easily. And… my professional life required a certain level of discretion. I didn’t form close relationships with colleagues. And… my personal life… was rather solitary. I truly don’t have anyone I would explicitly trust with such a weighty responsibility. It’s… a difficult admission, I know. But it’s the truth. Perhaps… perhaps a representative from the clinic would be the best option, given the circumstances. I apologize for the inconvenience. I realize it’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s better to be honest about your circumstances. And appointing a clinic representative is certainly a viable option. We have designated advocates here who are experienced in making healthcare decisions on behalf of patients. They’ll work with the medical team to ensure your wishes are respected. Let’s proceed with that then. I’ll need to complete some paperwork with you to officially designate a clinic representative as your healthcare proxy. Before we do that, though, is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your advance directives?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Maskal, I believe that covers everything. I… appreciate your patience and understanding. It’s… been a difficult conversation, but I feel… more prepared now. Knowing that there’s a plan in place… it’s reassuring. I trust your judgment implicitly. Let’s proceed with the paperwork, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm glad I could help, Evann. It is better to have a plan in place, even if it's a difficult conversation to have. Here you are. Just take your time and read through them carefully. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. We’ll go through them together once you’ve had a chance to review them. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Maskal, I believe that is all for today. I truly appreciate your time and assistance. You've been… remarkably patient with my… vagueness. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure. Take your time with those forms, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. Have a good day.
