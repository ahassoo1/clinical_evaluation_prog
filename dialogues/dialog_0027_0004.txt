DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: Right, routine vaccinations. Yes, I… recall something about that. Just to confirm, are we talking about your tetanus booster, and perhaps a flu shot since it’s approaching flu season?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tetanus… yeah, that sounds right. And a flu shot, definitely. I always get one of those. My husband gets one too, gotta protect us both, you know? I don’t always remember which ones I’ve had though, honestly. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter, yes. Let me just pull up your records here… Ah, okay. It appears you last had a tetanus booster in… 2018. And a flu shot last fall, October of 2024. So, you're due for a tetanus booster today. We can definitely do that. And since it's August, a flu shot now is a good idea. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or have you had any reactions to them in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with shots before. My grandma always said a little pinch is worth staying healthy, and she was a wise woman. Though… now that I think about it, my arm was a little sore last year after the flu shot. But nothing bad, just a bit achy. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Ms. Fornes. Some soreness at the injection site is very common, and usually resolves within a day or two. It just means your body is responding to the vaccine. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I’m getting older, so my knees aren’t what they used to be. But that’s just age, I guess. And I have a little bit of trouble with high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every morning. It seems to be keepin’ it under control. Doctor says I’m doin’ good with it. Is that something I need to worry about with the shots?
DOCTOR: No, that shouldn’t be a problem at all, Ms. Fornes, as long as your blood pressure is well-controlled. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's Lisinopril. Just one little pill every morning with my coffee. Been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? It really helps, thankfully. I used to get terrible headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And how about any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you take regularly?
PATIENT: Just my arthritis cream for my hands sometimes. It’s just a rub-on kind, nothing you swallow. And… oh! I take Vitamin D in the winter. Doctor said I wasn’t gettin’ enough sunshine, livin’ up here. But I stopped takin’ it a few months ago now, spring’s here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. That’s very helpful. Before we proceed with the vaccinations, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Sounds good to me. I always trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you’ll just have a seat here, and we’ll get started. I’m just going to wrap the cuff around your arm.
PATIENT: Okay. This table is kinda cold, isn’t it? But that’s alright, I’m used to it. Go ahead whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within a good range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good. Do you have any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe just a little ache in my lower back, but that’s just from workin’ in the garden yesterday. Nothing a little rest won’t fix. I do a lot of bendin’ and stoopin’ out there. An old woman’s problems, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gardening is good exercise, but it can certainly take a toll on the body. Alright, Ms. Fornes, it sounds like you’re in good shape for your vaccinations. We'll start with the tetanus booster, then the flu shot. I’ll clean the injection sites with an alcohol swab first. Just a little pinch, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, Doctor. Just get it over with, I always say! I don't mind the pinch, long as it keeps me healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, here we go. Just a quick pinch… There, that’s done. Now, the flu shot. Same thing, on the other arm. And that’s it. Both done. Do you feel alright?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn’t bad at all. Not bad at all! Just a little… sting, I guess. But nothin’ to worry about. Feels a bit warm, maybe? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Ms. Fornes. A little warmth and soreness at the injection site is very common, and it should subside within a day or two. We'll monitor you briefly to make sure you don’t have any adverse reactions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle. I appreciate you takin’ care of me. I’ll just sit here for a bit then, like you said. Watchin’ for any… funny feelin’s.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just let me know if you start to feel dizzy, lightheaded, or experience any unusual symptoms. We’ll just sit here quietly for about 15 minutes.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I will. It’s a nice clinic you have here, Doctor. Very… clean. And peaceful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fornes. We try to make it as comfortable as possible for our patients. It’s important to us that everyone feels safe and relaxed. It's been about 10 minutes, how are you feeling?
PATIENT: I'm feelin’ fine, actually. No dizziness or anything. Just a little warm spot on my arms, like you said. But nothin’ to worry about. I think I’m good to go. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a good man.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m glad to hear that. I'll print out a vaccination record for you to keep, and a little information sheet about potential side effects, just in case. I recommend getting some rest today and staying hydrated. Here you go. If you experience any unusual symptoms in the next few days, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Fornes. And thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: It was nice meetin' you, Doctor. I will, thank you. I will keep those numbers handy, just in case. You have a good day too. .
