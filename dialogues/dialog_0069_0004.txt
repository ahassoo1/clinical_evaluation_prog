DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a regular check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? My husband always reminds me. He’s good about that sort of thing. It’s for my immunizations, like you said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good – staying up-to-date with your immunizations is very important. And it's wonderful that your husband encourages you to do so. I see here it's been a little while since your last visit. Beyond the shots, are you experiencing any other health concerns or have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Not really, no. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Work keeps me busy, but it’s good work. Construction, you know? Keeps me moving. Nothing’s been bothering me, aches and pains aside – I’m 53, things ache sometimes! But nothing new or worrying, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Fornes. It’s excellent that you stay active with your work. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Well, honestly, not much to tell. I’ve always been pretty lucky with my health. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, rubella – but nothing serious. No big surgeries or anything. My mom lived to be 90, and her dad before her, so I guess good genes are in there somewhere. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to, if that makes sense. I try to take care of myself, eat okay, stay busy… you know.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about your family history, Ms. Fornes – longevity on both sides is a great sign. And it sounds like you prioritize a healthy lifestyle, which is fantastic. Just to be thorough, have you ever been allergic to any medications or have any known medical conditions, even minor ones like seasonal allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… Let me think. No, I don't think so. Not to any medications, anyway. I get a little sniffly in the spring with the pollen, but that’s just normal, right? Nothing I take anything for. And no, no medical conditions, not that I know of. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Fornes. And yes, seasonal allergies are very common. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just coffee to get me going in the mornings! I really try to avoid taking anything if I can. My grandma always said the less you put in your body, the better. I do take a multivitamin every now and then, but honestly, I forget half the time. It’s been a while since I’ve been consistent with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, goodness. Where to start? Well, I’ve been married to my husband, Tom, for… oh, 32 years now. We have two grown kids, both living out of state. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, nothing heavy. I live here in town, pretty quiet life. Mostly work and spending time with family when they visit. I volunteer at the local community center a couple of times a month, helping with events. Does that cover it? I don’t really have a lot of wild stories to tell, if that’s what you’re asking!
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Fornes. It sounds like you have a very fulfilling life! Now, before we get to the immunizations, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Afterwards, I’ll check your reflexes and blood pressure. If you could just relax and breathe normally, that would be great. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally…
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Let me know if you hear anything funny, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ears appear clear, no signs of infection or fluid. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Mucous membranes are normal in appearance. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal response. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. Do you have any questions about anything so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good, Doctor. Everything seems fine, which is a relief. I appreciate you being so thorough. So, what about the shots? Which ones am I getting today?
DOCTOR: That's great to hear, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad everything checked out well. Based on your age and immunization history, I recommend the updated COVID-19 booster, the annual flu vaccine, and a Tdap booster, as it’s been more than 10 years since your last tetanus shot. These will help protect you against those illnesses. Do those sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, those all sound good. I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry, right? Flu and COVID… you can’t be too careful. And I think I did get a tetanus shot a long time ago, so a booster makes sense. Let’s just get it over with, then. Which one first?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You’re right, it’s always best to be proactive. We’ll start with the flu vaccine, as it takes about two weeks to develop full immunity. It will be an injection in your upper arm. I’ll try to be as quick as possible. Just relax your arm, and you might feel a brief pinch. There you go. All done. Now, onto the COVID booster…
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t too bad. A little sting, but it’s over quickly. Alright, bring on the COVID booster. I’m ready. I just hope I don’t get a terrible reaction this time. Last time I felt pretty achy for a day or two.
DOCTOR: There we go, that’s the last one. And that’s everything. You might experience some mild side effects – soreness at the injection site, fatigue, or a low-grade fever – but those usually resolve within a day or two. It's good to stay hydrated and rest. Do you have any questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just gotta watch for those side effects, and stay hydrated. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle, and explained everything really well. I appreciate that. I guess I’m all set, then? Do I need to schedule a follow-up or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. No, you don’t need a follow-up unless you develop any concerning symptoms. If you experience a high fever, severe pain, or any other unusual reactions, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's your vaccination record and the clinic’s information. It's good to keep that record for your own reference. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been wonderful. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a wonderful day as well, and please stay healthy.
