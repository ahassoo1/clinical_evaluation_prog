DOCTOR: Right. Well, Emileigh, hello. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's… a check-up, I think? We just moved here. Everything's kinda new. I have Medicare, if that matters. I… honestly don't really remember what they told me to do when we signed up. It was a lot.
DOCTOR: Medicare is… fine. Everything is fine. A check-up. Yes. Well, that’s… vague. A general physical is good, I suppose. But usually people come in for something. Are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling sick? Not really. I get tired sometimes, but… doesn’t everyone? And my back kinda aches after I’ve been working on stuff. I, um… I fix things. Machines and… stuff. It’s a job. I don't know if that’s a symptom though?
DOCTOR: “Stuff.” Right. Well, “tired” can mean many things. And back pain is… remarkably common. But let’s try to be a little more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise… okay. Um… the tiredness is just… like, at the end of the day. I just wanna sit. And my back… it’s more when I’ve been bent over for a long time. Like, working on an engine or something. It doesn't hurt all the time, just… after. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry, I’m not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: “Just wanna sit.” Yes, well, many people do. And back pain after prolonged bending... Alright. Do you notice any radiating pain?
PATIENT: Radiating… what does that mean? Does that mean, like, does it spread? 'Cause sometimes it kinda feels… numb in my fingers after a while. But that might just be from the cold. We work outside a lot. I don't know. Is that radiating? Sorry! I just… I don’t really understand all the words.
DOCTOR: “Numb in the fingers.” That is… potentially relevant. So, the pain in your back, and then numbness in your fingers?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. Back gets sore, and then my hands and fingers kinda go… tingly? And numb. Not all the time, just… after a long day of fixing stuff. It goes away if I rest. My husband says it's probably just how my job is, but… he's not a doctor. Is that… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Well, your husband is… not a medical professional, so his opinion is… noted. It could be related to your occupation, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your reflexes and strength, and feel your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Checking stuff sounds good. I mean, if you need to. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded much, if that's okay. But if you need to check, go ahead. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: “Poked and prodded.” Yes, well, it’s a necessary evil. Please lie down on the examination table, facing up. I’m going to start with your reflexes. Just relax. Right leg… and left leg. Not bad. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Okay, lying down. Squeezing… Is that… enough? My hands are kinda cold. It's hard to squeeze when they’re cold. Everything feels kinda… funny. And… are you sure about the tapping? It kinda makes my legs jump. Not hurt, just… jump.
DOCTOR: “Jump.” Right. Well, your grip is… weak. And the reflexes are… diminished. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ow! Yeah, kinda. Right there. It doesn’t… sharp pain, but… yeah. It feels tender. Like, if you push on it too hard. Is that bad? Is something… broken? I don't wanna get a cast. I need to be able to fix stuff.
DOCTOR: “Tender.” Yes, it is. And the muscle spasms are… noticeable. It’s unlikely anything is broken, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some imaging—an X-ray of your lumbar spine, and possibly an MRI. And some blood work to rule out other issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Imaging… and blood work? Like… needles? And… what kind of issues? Is it something serious? I don't really like hospitals… or needles… or anything like that. Can't we just… put a heat pack on it? My husband always says a heat pack helps. Is that not a good idea? I’m… starting to feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: “Dizzy.” Right. Well, a heat pack may provide temporary relief, but it won’t diagnose the problem. The blood work is standard procedure to rule out inflammatory conditions. And the imaging… is essential. The MRI is non-invasive—you simply lie in a machine. As for the needles, I can arrange for a phlebotomist who is particularly… skilled. I’m going to schedule you for these tests at St. Jude’s Hospital. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: St. Jude’s… that’s… far. And… I think I might be allergic to… bananas? Maybe? I had a weird rash once after eating one. But I ate other fruit too, so it might not have been the banana. And… I get kinda motion sick sometimes. Especially if I have to lie flat. Like, in a car. Or… a machine. What kind of machine is the MRI? Is it loud? I really don’t like loud noises. Oh, and I get nervous around… bright lights. I just… I’m not good with… stuff.
DOCTOR: “Not good with stuff.” Yes, well, that is… noted. The MRI machine is… large, and it does make a rather loud humming noise. We can provide earplugs. And the facility has dimmed lighting options. As for the motion sickness, we can prescribe an anti-nausea medication. I will also write you a referral to a neurologist; it's possible this is a nerve issue. We'll get this sorted out, eventually. I need you to schedule these appointments within the week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Schedule… appointments… within the week. I… think so? But… I don’t really know how. My husband usually does all that stuff. And… St. Jude’s is really far. And… what if it’s something really bad? Is it… could it be something really bad? Maybe I should just… try the heat pack. .
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve provided you with the referrals and the necessary information. I suggest you contact St. Jude’s and schedule these appointments immediately. It’s crucial to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I have other patients to attend to. The receptionist can assist you with any logistical questions. Good day. .
