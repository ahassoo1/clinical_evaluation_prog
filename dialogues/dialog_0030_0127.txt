DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schaust. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 25 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, 25 is correct. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been getting weaker, slowly, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It’s getting noticeable, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids—that certainly warrants a closer look. “Slowly over the past few months” is helpful information. Can you describe the weakness in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started… I think in my legs, a little bit of trouble getting up from chairs, things like that. Nothing major at first. But it’s spread to my arms now, too. Lifting things is becoming difficult. It's… it’s not a sudden thing, more like I’m just… less strong overall. And it seems worse at the end of the day, if that makes sense? I get tired very easily, too.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. Gradual onset, worse with exertion and at the end of the day… very good details. And you mentioned drooping eyelids – is that on one side or both?
PATIENT: It’s… both, actually. But I think it's a bit worse on my right side. Not dramatically, but if I look in the mirror, it's definitely more noticeable there. It’s making it hard to keep my eyes open sometimes, and I’ve been getting some… double vision occasionally. It's fleeting, though. Doesn’t happen all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, bilateral drooping with some double vision – that’s important information. I’d like to ask a bit more about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, I don’t think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox and things like that, but… no, I haven't been diagnosed with anything specific. I've never really been… a sick person, honestly. I had a bad flu last winter, but that was it. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, quite a while.
DOCTOR: I see. No prior diagnoses, and not much medical history to speak of. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any surgeries, or… any serious injuries, for that matter. A few scrapes and bruises here and there, but nothing that required a trip to the hospital, or anything like that. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a… difficult question. My parents are… well, we’re not very close. I haven’t seen them in several years. I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. My father always kept things very private, and my mother… she’s not very forthcoming. I do have an aunt on my mother’s side, but I haven’t spoken to her in a long time either. I’m really not much help on that front, I’m afraid. It's… a bit of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Family history can be tricky. No worries at all; we can proceed without that information for now. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. I don't really care for them, and I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I eat a fairly balanced diet, and I try to get regular exercise when I can, though with the weakness, it’s been getting harder lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and a generally healthy lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. I haven't had any… rashes or breathing difficulties after consuming anything. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything, but I haven't exactly been keeping a detailed list, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for providing all of this information, Mr. Schaust. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are. I just… I hope you can find out what’s wrong. It’s unsettling not knowing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to figure this out. First, I’m going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll examine your eyes, listen to your heart and lungs, and test your muscle strength and reflexes. Your vital signs are within the normal range. I did note some weakness, particularly with repeated movements, as you mentioned, and the drooping of your eyelids is more pronounced on the right side. Your reflexes are normal. I’m going to document these findings. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I'm concerned about a possible neuromuscular condition. There are several possibilities, but one that comes to mind is Myasthenia Gravis. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm. I’d like to order a blood test to check for specific antibodies, and potentially an Electromyography, or EMG, to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what was that? It sounds… serious. And an… EMG? What does that involve? I… I'm not a fan of needles, if you don’t mind me saying so. Is it painful? I suppose if it's important… but I’d like to know what I'm getting into, if possible. And what are the other possibilities you mentioned? It’s… a bit overwhelming, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to know more. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It’s manageable with treatment, but early diagnosis is important. As for the EMG, it involves inserting a very small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a brief muscle twitch, but it’s generally not painful. We only need to insert the needle a few times in each muscle group we're testing. Other possibilities include other neuromuscular disorders, like Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or even certain forms of muscular dystrophy, though those are less likely given the gradual onset and your age. We need the blood test and EMG to narrow down the diagnosis. Would you be comfortable with me ordering those tests?
PATIENT: I… alright. If you think it’s necessary, yes. Please. I’d rather know what I’m dealing with, even if it's… not good news. I suppose a little discomfort is worth it, if it can help. So… yes, order the tests. And… how long will it take to get the results? And where do I go for the… EMG? Will I need to fast beforehand? There's so much...
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and I’ll walk you through everything. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests—you can get those done at any local lab. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. As for the EMG, I’m referring you to Dr. Emily Carter, a neurologist at City General Hospital. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. You don’t need to fast for the EMG, but it’s best to avoid strenuous exercise on the day of the test. Her office will provide detailed instructions when they call. While we’re waiting for the results, I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. Note any changes in weakness, fatigue, or double vision. And please, avoid any activities that significantly worsen your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, actually. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. It’s… a little frightening, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen and… not dismiss it as just being tired, like some people might. I'll… I’ll schedule the blood tests tomorrow. And I’ll wait for Dr. Carter’s office to call. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Anything that would warrant me contacting you before the results come back? Just… in case?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. It’s important to me that your concerns are taken seriously. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Regarding what to watch out for, if you experience any of the following, please contact me immediately: significant difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking; worsening double vision; or any new neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, or severe muscle pain. Also, if your weakness suddenly becomes more severe or widespread, don’t hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. While it’s unlikely, we always want to err on the side of caution. Otherwise, try to stay as active as you can without overexerting yourself, and focus on getting adequate rest. We'll review the test results as soon as they come in and discuss the best course of treatment. Do you have any further questions before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Really, thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I… I appreciate it. I’ll get those tests scheduled, and I’ll wait for Dr. Carter’s office to call. Thank you again for your time and… your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I'm glad I could help, and please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results.
