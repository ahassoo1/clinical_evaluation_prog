DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Nixon. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg... it's gotten rather swollen, you see. And I've been told I have a… a funny heartbeat sometimes. It’s been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and a feeling of a funny heartbeat. Thanks for letting me know. Let’s start with the leg. How long has it been swollen?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe a week ago, I’d say. It wasn’t much at first, just a bit bigger than usual. But it’s gotten worse each day, I believe. It's a bit uncomfortable now, especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of gradually worsening swelling. And you said it’s more uncomfortable at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. When I've been on my feet a lot, teaching, it feels… heavier, you see? And a bit achy. If I sit with it up, it feels a wee bit better, but not much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the swelling just in your calf, or does it go up higher or down towards your foot?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It does go down a bit towards my ankle, but not into my foot, no. Mostly just the calf feels… thick. It’s hard to explain. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly in the calf, gradually worsening over a week, more noticeable after being on your feet. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Hm… let me see. No, I don't think so. It looks… normal colour, I suppose. It doesn't feel particularly warm either. Just… big. And a bit heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no redness or warmth. And you mentioned a funny heartbeat… can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s difficult. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly. It just feels… fluttery, sometimes. Like a fish flopping about, maybe? And it comes and goes. It doesn’t happen all the time. It's just… irregular. I was told it's called… atrial… something? I'm not very good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Atrial fibrillation. That's the thing. I was told that’s what I have. It happens sometimes, but I’ve not been to a doctor about it before, just told what it is. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been told you have atrial fibrillation. It's good you're coming in to get it checked out now. It can be something we need to manage, but it's not necessarily "bad" right away. We need to see how often it's happening and how it's affecting you. Before we go further, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, and I'm fine with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or regular medications. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, things like that – but nothing serious. My mum always said I was a very healthy child. I've not had any operations, and I haven't been in hospital since I was a wee bairn with a broken arm. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mum is still alive and she's quite well, thank you. She's got a bit of arthritis in her hands, but nothing major. My father… he passed away a few years ago now. He had problems with his heart, I believe. Something about high blood pressure, and he had a stroke. It was very sad. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, your mum is well with arthritis, and your father had high blood pressure and a stroke. That is relevant, yes. A family history of heart problems is always good to know. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m a teacher, as you know. So, I spend a lot of time on my feet. I walk to work, usually. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but not every day. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruit and vegetables, but it can be difficult when you're busy. I don't really do much exercise, to be honest, other than walking. I like reading, and I enjoy spending time with my friends. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are a bit irregular, consistent with what you've told me about the atrial fibrillation. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88 and irregular. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. Could you please point to where it's most swollen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right here, mostly. It feels a bit… tight, too. And if I press on it… It doesn't hurt, but it feels… different than my other leg. A bit softer, maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some swelling and slight pitting edema. It does feel softer than your other leg. I don’t feel any warmth or redness. Right calf is 38 centimeters, left calf is 41 centimeters. There’s a 3 centimeter difference. Okay. To help us figure out what's going on, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A D-dimer test to rule out a blood clot, and an ECG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps you understand what's happening, then yes, please. A D-dimer and… ECG, was it? Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Will it be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, the D-dimer is just a blood test, so it will be a quick prick of the finger. The ECG is completely painless, it just involves sticking some small patches on your chest, arms and legs. It'll take about 10-15 minutes to get the results. While we wait, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too bad at all. Just the finger prick and some patches. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Hmm… yes, I do have a question, actually. Is this… is this serious? Will I need to be in hospital? I have a class to teach next week, and I really don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern. It’s difficult to say definitively at this point until we get the results of the tests. The swelling could be a number of things, and the atrial fibrillation needs to be properly assessed. While the possibility of needing further investigation, like an ultrasound, or even a short stay in hospital can’t be completely ruled out, it’s not necessarily likely at this stage. We’ll take things one step at a time. The most important thing is to get a clear understanding of what’s happening and then work out the best plan of action. Let me just pop out and request those tests for you. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Right, thank you, Doctor. I'll just sit here and try not to worry too much. It's just… it's not something I've ever experienced before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, the lab is ready for the blood draw and we have an ECG machine ready for you down the hall. We'll do those first. We should have the results back within about 15-20 minutes. If you're happy, we can head down and get them done now. A nurse will be with you to explain everything and make you comfortable. Do you need assistance getting up?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds good. Thank you. No, I'm alright getting up, thank you. I'm not too bad. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're just going to head down this hallway to the lab first… It's just a quick finger prick for the blood test, and then we'll pop into the ECG room right next door. The nurse will explain everything in more detail. I’ll be right here once you're finished with the tests. And if you feel unwell at any point, please tell the nurse immediately.
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I’ll see you in a few minutes then.
DOCTOR: .
