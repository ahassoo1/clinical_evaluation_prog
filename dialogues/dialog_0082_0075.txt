DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to be here, though I wish the reason was a bit more cheerful! I've been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even with the machine I use at night. They told me it should have fixed things, you see, the sleep apnea. But it hasn't, not really.
DOCTOR: Sleepy despite using the machine, you say. Hmm. Alright. And how long has this been going on, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It's been about… six months now, I suppose, since they first gave me the machine. At first, it was wonderful! I felt like a new man. But then, gradually, the tiredness crept back. Maybe three months ago is when I really started noticing it again, consistently. It's just… frustrating, you know? I was hoping for a bit more of a permanent fix.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's understandable. It is frustrating when something doesn't continue to work as expected. And you said “the machine”—is that a CPAP machine for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A CPAP machine. It's a bit noisy, really, but I got used to it. My wife... well, my ex-wife, she couldn't stand it. Said it sounded like a small hurricane in the bedroom! But that's another story. The important thing is, it was supposed to help me sleep better and feel more awake during the day. And it did, for a while. But not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you're sleepy, is it just feeling tired, or are you nodding off during the day?
PATIENT: It's more than just tired, Doctor. It's… a heavy feeling, like someone’s weighing down my eyelids. And yes, sometimes I doze off. Not while driving, thankfully! But I’ll be reading, or even just sitting and talking to someone, and I’ll… drift off for a few seconds. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. My daughter was visiting last week, and it happened right in the middle of her telling me about her new job. Woke up and completely lost the thread of the conversation. That's when I knew I really needed to come see someone.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing focus and dozing off like that is concerning. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. I think I’ve been a bit more… irritable, maybe? Not with anyone in particular, just generally a bit short-tempered. My appetite hasn't been great, though that might be the heat, it’s been awfully warm lately. Oh, and I wake up with a dry mouth almost every morning, even with the humidifier on the machine. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Dry mouth, irritability, and decreased appetite… alright. Let’s take a look at your history here… I see you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about ten years ago, and you had a bout of pneumonia last winter. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me since. Oh! And I had a bit of a scare a few years back with some irregular heartbeats, but the cardiologist said it wasn’t anything to worry about, just a bit of atrial fibrillation. They put me on some medication for that, but I stopped taking it a while ago. It wasn’t agreeing with me, caused too many side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gallbladder removal… and you stopped the medication for the irregular heartbeats due to side effects. Do you remember what medication that was?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was a little white pill. Oh, dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think it started with a 'P'... perhaps Propranolol? Or something similar? I’m fairly certain it was a beta-blocker. My doctor at the time, Dr. Ramirez, she's retired now. I don’t remember the exact name, I’m afraid. It wasn’t a particularly long course of treatment, maybe six months or so. But it didn’t sit well with me. I felt constantly tired and a bit dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible Propranolol use. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to take penicillin as a child, but that was a long time ago. I don't recall any specific allergies listed on my chart either. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Although, I do get a bit of a stuffy nose in the spring with all the pollen, but that’s just seasonal, not a true allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Then we'll see if we need to order any tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling like myself again. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, your lungs sound clear, and your heart rhythm is a little irregular, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140 over 90. Mild redness in the throat. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. 95%. That’s good. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit at the end of the day sometimes, but nothing significant. It could just be from standing for too long, to be honest. I'm not on my feet all day, but when I go to the market or visit my daughter, I do tend to be moving around quite a bit. It’s usually gone by the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, the fact that the CPAP isn't fully resolving the issue, and your history of atrial fibrillation, I'd like to order a few tests. We'll do a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid panel. We should also repeat the EKG to see if there have been any changes since your previous one. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this. The tests sound perfectly fine to me. Will you be calling me with the results, or should I schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: I will call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within a few days. If anything concerning shows up, we'll schedule an appointment right away. Otherwise, we can discuss the results over the phone and decide on a plan. In the meantime, continue using the CPAP machine as prescribed. It's important to rule out other possibilities before making any changes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a bit, to be honest. Knowing you're looking into this systematically is a relief. Thank you very much. I appreciate your patience and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. That's what I'm here for. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood for the tests. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
