DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you as well. Hmm, what brings me in… Let me see. It’s about my blood, I think. My… someone mentioned I should know what type it is. For… things. It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. I just want to be sure, you know? It's for...well, I don't exactly recall what it’s for, but it seemed important.
DOCTOR: I see. You're interested in determining your blood type. It’s… prudent to be aware of such things, I suppose. Though, at your age, I find people often have this request due to… well, nevermind. To clarify, is there a specific concern that prompted this request, or was it merely a suggestion?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, at my age… yes, well, things do get muddled, don’t they? No, no specific concern, not that I remember. It wasn’t a doctor who suggested it, I don’t think. Maybe it was… a friend? Or someone at the community center? Really, I just thought it would be a good idea. Better safe than sorry, you know? I wouldn’t want to be… unprepared, if something were to happen. But truly, I don’t know what would happen. It’s all rather vague.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s… commendable you're being proactive. Though, frankly, I find it a rather unusual request without a clear indication. Regardless, we can certainly ascertain your blood type. Have you ever had any blood tests performed before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I’ve had… so many doctors over the years, you see. Living this long… it all blurs together. I think I might have had some when I broke my wrist a few years back? But that was at the hospital, and it was all a rush. I don’t remember if they said anything about my… blood group. Honestly, I doubt it. Everything was just “quick, fix the bone!” I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't tell me. It's hard to recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever received a blood transfusion, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: A blood… transfusion? Oh, dear. Let me think… That sounds… serious, doesn’t it? No, I don’t think so. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered, for my age. I've had the usual bumps and scrapes, but nothing that would require… putting new blood in. No, I'm quite certain I haven't had a transfusion. But… are you sure? Perhaps a very long time ago? It’s hard to be positive when you’ve lived as long as I have.
DOCTOR: Very well. Just to be thorough, Ms. Nini, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm… Let me see. I used to get a bit of a rash from… poison ivy, I think. As a child, you know? But that was ages ago. And I’m rather careful in the garden now. I don't think I have any serious allergies. No trouble with penicillin, or any of those strong medicines, that I recall. Nothing that would send me to the hospital, anyway. I do prefer chamomile tea, if that counts as an allergy to not having something! But truly, I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to. Do you need a long list? I'm terribly sorry I'm not more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, medications... Yes, let me think. Just the usual things, really. I take a small pill for my… water retention. It helps with my ankles, you see. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for the pain. A little white pill. I can't recall the name, but the doctor at the clinic prescribes it. Just when needed, though. Not every day. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, Doctor recommended it. It's a small capsule. Honestly, that's all I can think of. Nothing fancy. I try to stay away from too many pills, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Nini, to proceed with determining your blood type, we will need to draw a small sample of your blood. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood draw… Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. I've had my blood drawn many times, I suppose. It doesn't bother me much. A little pinch, and then it's over. Just… promise me it won’t take too long? I have a luncheon with some friends later, and I wouldn’t want to be late. And… could you use a nice clean bandage afterwards? I do dislike a messy bandage. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nini, a clean bandage is perfectly acceptable. It will be a quick procedure. I will inform the phlebotomist of your preference. Let’s proceed. Now, if you'll just follow me to the examination room. We'll get this done quickly.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. A luncheon, you see. It’s with the garden club. We're discussing… dahlias, I believe. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, they have nice chairs in that room. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: This way, Ms. Nini. We have a comfortable chair for you. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Oh, good! A comfortable chair is just what I needed. Thank you, Doctor. It's a lovely room, very bright. I always did appreciate a bright room. Now, are you certain that phlebotomist is gentle? I've had some… unfortunate experiences in the past. Not that I want to dwell on it, of course.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, I assure you, our phlebotomist is highly skilled and gentle. She has years of experience. I trust her implicitly. Now, let’s just give her a moment to prepare. No prior blood type on file… remarkable.
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. Years of experience… that's reassuring. I do hate a clumsy needle. Such a pretty painting… is that a sunflower? I always did love sunflowers. They're so cheerful, don't you think? Remind me of… well, never mind. I suppose I’m rambling. It’s just… waiting always makes me a bit… restless. Perhaps a magazine? Do you have any gardening magazines?
DOCTOR: We have a variety of magazines in the waiting area, Ms. Nini. The phlebotomist will be with you presently. I assure you, this will not be a lengthy process. .
PATIENT: Oh… very well. I suppose I’ll just… wait then. .
