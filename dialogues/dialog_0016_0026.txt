DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. Like someone flipped a switch. I don’t feel sick, not really, but I can’t… do anything when it hits. My husband, bless his heart, has to help me with… things. I don’t quite remember what “things” all are, to be honest. The young man at the lab said something about my… numbers? Being off. Something about my muscles, I think. It’s all rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden tiredness… that’s definitely something we need to look into. And you mentioned numbers from the lab – that's helpful. It sounds like you had some blood work done recently?
PATIENT: Blood work, yes. They poked and prodded, as they always do. Honestly, I don’t remember where it was done, or even when. Seems like just yesterday, or maybe last week? Time just… slips away, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband, he keeps track of all that sort of thing. He’s a very organized man. Do you need the exact date? Because I certainly don’t have it on me.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ardelle. We can definitely look it up here in the system. Knowing roughly when it was done is perfectly fine for now. You said the tiredness comes on suddenly… can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like being sleepy, not at all. It's… like all my strength just vanishes. I feel… heavy. And weak. Like I’ve been carrying rocks all day. It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Makes it hard to… to get up, or even just to stand. Sometimes my arms feel it too. It's just… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. And then, after a while, it goes away. Just as suddenly as it came. It’s odd, really. Not a gradual fading, but poof – gone. I used to be quite strong, you know. A commercial diver. Though that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A commercial diver – wow, that’s quite a history! Okay, so sudden onset of weakness, mostly in the legs, sometimes arms, and it resolves just as quickly as it starts. And it’s not accompanied by feeling sleepy or fatigued in general, just this sudden weakness?
PATIENT: Exactly! Not sleepy, not achy, just… gone. Like the power’s been cut off. It’s not like I’ve been working hard or anything, either. I mostly keep to the house these days. My husband worries about me going out alone. He says I get… confused. Which, well, he's not entirely wrong. Though I resent the implication, naturally. I used to navigate entire underwater wrecks! Now I can barely remember where I put my spectacles. It’s rather embarrassing, if I’m honest. It just happens. And then, like I said, it’s gone. Until the next time, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good you have your husband looking out for you. So, to recap, we have sudden episodes of weakness, primarily in your legs, that come and go quickly. No associated fatigue or pain, and you’ve noticed some memory difficulties as well. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly haven't paid much attention. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything specific. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been sitting for a while, sometimes when I’m trying to do something around the house… It’s just… random. It’s most frustrating when I’m out in the garden, trying to deadhead the roses. Can’t very well explain to a rose why I suddenly can’t stand up, can you? Though, I suppose they wouldn't understand anyway. My husband says it could be my age. Everything’s “my age” these days, according to him. Honestly, I find it a bit patronizing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. It’s good to be thorough and explore all possibilities. Before we get to potential causes, let’s quickly go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that your doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: Well, I have the usual aches and pains for someone my age. Arthritis in my hands, mostly. And my blood pressure's been a bit… elevated, according to Dr. Peterson. He put me on a little pill for it, but honestly, I can’t remember what it’s called. And I suppose there’s the occasional… dizziness. Not a spinning kind of dizziness, just a feeling of being… off-balance. It doesn’t happen often. And I take something for my cholesterol, too. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. A very unpleasant experience. My husband was wonderful through it all, of course. He always is. Everything else… honestly, it all blurs together after a while. Is this important? It all seems rather… excessive.
DOCTOR: It’s all very helpful, Ardelle. Knowing all of this gives me a much clearer picture. So, arthritis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, dizziness occasionally, and gallbladder removal years ago. And you’re on medication for the blood pressure and cholesterol, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Little white pills, mostly. Though I couldn’t tell you which little white pills, or what they're for, if you asked me. My husband handles the refills, you see. He’s very good with all that sort of thing. I just… take them when he tells me to. Honestly, I feel like a child sometimes. He worries so much, you know? About my memory, about my balance, about… everything. It’s rather exhausting, actually. I used to be perfectly capable. A strong, independent woman. Now, I just… exist. And take little white pills. It's all a bit undignified. Do you think… is this normal for someone my age?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when things change, and it’s completely valid to want to maintain your independence. What you’re describing – some memory changes, occasional dizziness, and needing assistance with medication – can be common with age, but that doesn't mean it’s something we should ignore. And it's wonderful that you have your husband to support you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t believe I do. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant rash once, years ago, after using a new hand cream. But that wasn’t an allergy, my husband said, just a sensitivity. He’s very good at distinguishing the difference, you see. He’s a retired pharmacist, actually. Which explains a lot, I suppose. Honestly, I wouldn’t trust myself to remember if I did have an allergy. He keeps a list, I’m sure. He keeps a list of everything, really. It’s rather… meticulous. And a little bit stifling, if I’m honest. But he means well. He always does. Are we getting anywhere with this? It all feels rather… pointless.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ardelle. Every piece of information is helpful. And it's very reassuring to know your husband is a retired pharmacist. Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and balance. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I warn you, my balance isn't what it used to be. And my strength… well, as we’ve established, it comes and goes. I do hope you have a sturdy chair. I wouldn’t want to fall and cause a fuss. My husband would be terribly worried. He’s very protective, you see. Always has been. But yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please. I bruise easily, too. Everything seems to fall apart these days. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll take things very slowly and gently. Your blood pressure is 142/88, and your pulse is 72, regular. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let's just have you sit here for a moment. I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs and arms. Just relax, and don't worry if they're not quite as strong as they used to be. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in the upper extremities, and 1+ bilaterally in the lower extremities. That's within normal limits for your age. Now, let's try standing up. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Standing up… right. Here we go. There. That was… not graceful. My legs feel rather weak, as you can see. And a bit shaky. I do hope you have a steady chair, like I said. It’s rather embarrassing, actually. I used to be able to stand on my head! Underwater, no less. Now, I struggle to stand on my own two feet. It’s… demoralizing. My husband always says I’m being dramatic, but I assure you, it's not. It’s just… different now. Much different. Is that alright? Am I doing it correctly? I feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly alright, Ardelle. And please, don't feel foolish. This is all very helpful information. I can see some mild weakness in your legs, and a bit of instability, which is consistent with what you've been describing. Now, I’d like you to try walking a few steps for me, if you’re comfortable. Just a few steps forward and back. I’ll be right here to support you. Her gait is a bit slow and unsteady, with a slightly wider base of support. There's some mild difficulty with initiation of movement, but no significant dragging or shuffling.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Walking… right. Here we go. There. That was… exhausting. I feel rather breathless, actually. And my legs are trembling. I do hope you noticed nothing too alarming. My husband always says I walk like a penguin, but I assure you, it’s not intentional. It’s just… the way my legs feel. Weak, and wobbly, and unreliable. I do hope this is sufficient. I’m not sure how much longer I can stand. It’s… undignified. And embarrassing. I used to navigate complex underwater currents with ease! Now, I struggle to walk a few steps without falling. It’s… disheartening. Are we nearly finished? I’m starting to feel rather faint.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Ardelle. And please, don’t feel embarrassed. This is all very valuable information. You’re right, it’s clear there’s some weakness and instability. Okay, one last thing, if you don't mind. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, and lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The sudden episodes of weakness, combined with the mild instability and memory difficulties, could be due to a number of things. It could be related to your blood pressure, or possibly a vitamin deficiency, or even something neurological. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin D levels, and a TSH to check your thyroid function. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests. Of course. It always comes down to more tests. My husband always says I’m a hypochondriac, but I assure you, I’m not. I just… feel unwell. And it’s all rather confusing. Blood tests, EKG… it’s all a bit overwhelming. And expensive, I’m sure. My Medicare covers most of it, I suppose, but still. Vitamin D… I do try to get some sunshine, but it’s not easy. And my thyroid… I don’t even know what that is. It's all very technical. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I have no choice. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And I hope it doesn’t reveal anything too alarming. My husband always says I worry too much, but I assure you, it’s not intentional. I just… prefer to be prepared. So, blood tests, EKG… and then what? Do I have to come back for more tests? And will you tell me what all these tests are for? I just… prefer to understand what’s going on. Is that too much to ask? It's all rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ardelle. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand what’s going on, and I’m happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. The thyroid is a small gland in your neck that controls your metabolism. A simple blood test can tell us if it’s functioning properly. As for the other tests, the complete blood count will check for anemia and other blood disorders, and the comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. We’ll get the lab order sent electronically to the lab, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. It should only take about 30 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Depending on the results, we may need to do further testing, but let’s focus on getting these initial tests done first. And no, you’re not a hypochondriac. It's good that you're proactive about your health and seeking answers. We'll figure this out together. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A gland in my neck… I suppose that’s good to know. And blood tests… and then waiting. I hate waiting. My husband always says I’m impatient, but I assure you, it’s not intentional. I just… prefer to know what’s going on. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Just… the waiting. And the potential for bad news. My husband always says I worry too much, but I assure you, it’s not intentional. I just… have a vivid imagination. So, I go to the lab, they take some blood, and then I wait. And then I come back here, and you tell me what they find. Is that correct? And if it’s something bad, what happens then? Do I have to go to the hospital? Do I have to have surgery? My husband always says I jump to conclusions, but I assure you, it’s not intentional. I just… prefer to be prepared for the worst. This is all rather… unsettling. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? It's all rather… overwhelming. .
DOCTOR: That’s correct. You go to the lab, they'll take some blood, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I understand your anxiety about the potential for bad news, and it's perfectly natural to feel worried. But let’s try to remain optimistic and focus on getting the information we need. And no, you’re not jumping to conclusions. It's good to think through potential scenarios, but let’s wait for the test results before we worry too much about what might happen. If the results do indicate something serious, we'll discuss all your options and develop a plan of care that’s right for you. We'll explore all possible treatments, and I'll be with you every step of the way. For now, let’s just focus on getting these initial tests done. I’m going to print out a lab order and some instructions for you. And I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Does that sound alright?
