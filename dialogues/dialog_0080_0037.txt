DOCTOR: Hi Margret, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It is hard to breathe sometimes. It started maybe two weeks ago, I think? Not sure exactly. It is a little scary when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing and shortness of breath for about two weeks. That is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it happens… let me think. It seems to be worse when I am doing things. Like, if I walk up the hill to the store, it gets bad. Or if I try to help my daughter in the garden. When I am sitting still, it is not so bad. Though, sometimes even then, it comes. It feels like… a whistle in my chest? Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly – a whistling sensation in your chest. That sounds like wheezing, and it's helpful to know it's brought on by activity. Does anything specifically trigger it besides activity, like dust, cold air, or strong smells?
PATIENT: Oh, that is a good question. Let me see… Dust, yes, maybe. My daughter, she likes to clean, and sometimes after she is finished, it is worse. And the cold air… yes, I think so too. When I go outside in the morning, it can bother me. Strong smells… not that I have noticed. Is that important, Doctor? Do many people get it from dust and cold?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes. Dust and cold air can definitely be triggers for a lot of people, especially with something like asthma or COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Have you ever been diagnosed with either of those before?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those are… big words, Doctor. I don't think so. I have been to doctors before, of course, but nobody ever told me I had those things. Mostly, I just see the doctor when I have a cold, or a bad knee from playing sports. I used to be a very good runner, you know. Many years ago. But no, I don’t think anyone ever said those names to me. What is COPD? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's okay, those are big words! COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Essentially, it's a lung condition that makes it harder to breathe over time. It’s often caused by smoking, but not always. It can definitely be serious if it's not managed, but lots of people live full lives with it. Don't worry, we’re not at the point of diagnosing anything yet! We're just gathering information. Just to be thorough, have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smokers?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My husband, he used to smoke, a long time ago. But he stopped many years before he… well, before he left. And I always made him go outside when he did. I never liked the smell. So, no, not really around a lot of smokers. My daughter doesn’t smoke either, thank goodness. Is that helpful, Doctor? What could be making me wheeze if it’s not the smoking?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful to know. It rules out one of the most common causes. Since it's triggered by activity, dust, and cold air, it could be something called asthma, or it could be something else. To get a better idea, I'd like to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Could you sit back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can sit back. Asthma… is that like a bad cough? My grandson, he sometimes gets a bad cough when it is cold. But this is not so much a cough. It is more… tight. In my chest. I will sit back for you, Doctor. Do I need to do anything special?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special at all, just relax and breathe normally. Asthma can cause a cough, but it doesn’t always. Sometimes it just feels like tightness, like you described – exactly what you're feeling. Okay, breathe in deeply for me… and out… again… good. Now, can you breathe in as deeply as you can and hold it for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, I am breathing. It feels a little… strange, with that cold thing on my back. Is everything okay, Doctor? It feels a little tight now, if I am honest. A little worse than before. Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear some wheezing, and a little bit of tightness, just as you described. It's good that we're getting this information. And it's perfectly fine if it feels a little worse, it can sometimes happen when we listen. I’m going to listen to your chest again, but this time, I’m going to ask you to breathe faster. Just a normal, slightly faster breathing pattern. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Faster breathing… yes, I think so. It feels… difficult. I am getting a little dizzy now, Doctor. And my chest really hurts. Is this normal? Maybe I should stop? I don’t want to make it worse. I am starting to feel frightened.
DOCTOR: Okay, Margret, stop right there. You're right to tell me you're feeling frightened and that it's too difficult. That’s important. I apologize; I pushed a little too far without realizing how uncomfortable it was making you. It sounds like this might be more serious than I initially thought, and we need to be cautious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check your oxygen levels and rule out anything more concerning, like pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism. Would you be able to go to the hospital for these tests today?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh dear. A hospital… I… I don't like hospitals. Is it very bad? I just thought it was… a little wheezing. Is it something serious, Doctor? And a blood test… I don't like needles either. I feel… very overwhelmed now. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps some medicine?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Margret. Hospitals can be frightening, and I apologize for the worry I’ve caused. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to rule out anything that could be, and the fastest way to do that is with these tests. We always err on the side of caution. I can prescribe an inhaler for you to use in the meantime, which might help with the wheezing and tightness. But it won’t give us a clear picture of what’s going on. The blood test is just a small prick, and we can get it done quickly. Would you like me to call your daughter to come with you to the hospital?
PATIENT: An inhaler… yes, that sounds good. Something to help me breathe. Yes, please call my daughter. She is very good with these things. And she can drive me. I don't think I should drive myself if I am having trouble breathing. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind to do that. I am still scared, but… at least I won’t be alone. What will the hospital do? Will they keep me overnight?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. It's perfectly okay to be scared, and you absolutely shouldn't go through this alone. Let me call your daughter first. She's on her way. At the hospital, they'll do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and the blood test will check your oxygen levels and look for any signs of infection. They'll likely monitor your breathing for a little while. Whether you need to stay overnight depends on the results of those tests. If everything looks okay, you might be able to go home later today. But we need to be sure before we make any decisions. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler – that will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. Here's a written note for your daughter, explaining everything, and a list of emergency contacts. Do you have any questions for me before your daughter arrives?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… that sounds complicated. Is it hard to use? I am not very good with… machines. And what if it doesn't work? Will I… stop breathing? Oh dear. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I just… I am very anxious. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I appreciate it very much. I hope my daughter gets here soon. .
DOCTOR: It's okay to be anxious, Margret. It’s not complicated at all, and I’ll walk you through it before you go. It's a simple device; think of it like an inhaler for asthma. It delivers medicine directly to your lungs. I'm glad I could help, and you're very welcome. We’ll get through this together. Don't worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. .
