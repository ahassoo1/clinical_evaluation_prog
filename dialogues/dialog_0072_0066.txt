DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're forty years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, forty years old, that's correct. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain… I’ve been experiencing a popping or clicking sensation in my back. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out. It doesn’t cause any pain, thankfully, but it's… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: “Disconcerting,” yes. Well, we certainly don’t want anything left unchecked. Let’s try to pinpoint this a little more precisely. When did you first notice this popping or clicking sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, about three months ago. Perhaps sometime in early May? It wasn’t immediate, it was gradual. I first noticed it when I was bending over to pick something up – a toolbox, I think. It wasn’t a sharp thing, just… felt something shift. Then it started happening more often, with different movements. It's mostly when I bend or twist, but occasionally when I just stand up from a chair.
DOCTOR: Three months, starting with bending… and it's become more frequent. And you said it doesn’t cause any pain?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No pain whatsoever. It doesn't ache, doesn’t radiate, nothing like that. It's purely a sensation – a feeling of something… moving within my back. It's almost like a small bubble popping, if that makes any sense. It doesn't limit my movement, either. I'm still able to do my work, which involves a fair bit of bending and lifting, thankfully. Though I admit, it does make me a little wary sometimes.
DOCTOR: "A little wary," I understand. And your work is physically demanding, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I’m an electrical and electronics installer and repairer, but primarily on transportation equipment. So, I'm often working in tight spaces – under buses, inside trucks, that sort of thing. A lot of crouching, bending, reaching… and lifting components. It requires a good deal of physical exertion, and I'm on my feet for most of the day. I've been doing this for about fifteen years now, and haven't had any major back issues until this started.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years in the trade… alright. Before we proceed with a physical examination, let’s get a more complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I've always been relatively healthy. I have private insurance, and I get a yearly check-up, and everything has always been normal. I don’t take any regular medication, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I'm married, and my wife would certainly let me know if there was anything, she’s quite diligent about these things! I'm generally a very active person, even outside of work. I enjoy gardening and walking, when I have the time.
DOCTOR: Very good. No allergies, no medications, active lifestyle… And any family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother had some arthritis in her knees when she got older, but nothing significant in her back. My father, he was a carpenter, very active, and I don’t recall him ever having any back trouble either. My grandparents… I wasn’t very close to them, so I don’t have much information about their medical history. I suppose it's possible there was something on that side of the family, but I wouldn’t know for certain. I do remember my uncle complaining about a slipped disc once, many years ago, but that was a single incident, and I don't know any details.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, generally a healthy family history. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. If you don’t mind, I’d like to assess your range of motion, check for any tenderness, and perform a few neurological tests. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Yes, please. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. Please lie flat on your back, and I’m going to start by gently palpating your spine to check for any areas of tenderness. I’ll also be assessing your range of motion – I’m going to ask you to bend forward, backward, and side to side. Just let me know if anything causes pain or discomfort. Tell me, do you feel any pain or tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. It's not painful to the touch… just feels normal, really. I can feel you moving along the spine, but no discomfort at all. It’s… a little strange to be examined like this, to be honest, but not unpleasant. It’s reassuring to know you're checking thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you slowly bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: There you go… I can get almost to my toes, but not quite. It doesn’t hurt, but I feel a bit of a stretch in my lower back, as I'm bending. The familiar sensation, almost. It’s not sharp, just a mild pull. It feels… normal, for me, bending like that. I do a fair amount of bending at work, after all.
DOCTOR: “Mild pull” with forward flexion. Alright. Now, can you gently lean to the right, and then to the left?
PATIENT: Okay… leaning to the right… and now to the left. Again, no pain, Doctor. Just a stretch, similar to bending. I feel the movement in my sides, mostly. And, if I’m honest, a little bit in my lower back, but nothing significant. It’s hard to describe… it's not painful, it's just… I feel it, you know? A sort of awareness of the muscles stretching. The clicking sensation hasn’t occurred during these movements, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed this clicking sensation during any specific movements like these bends or twists?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's a good question. It doesn’t seem to coincide with these movements specifically. It happens more randomly, I think. Sometimes when I stand up from a chair, or when I’m just walking around. It’s not predictable. It’s just… there. Occasionally when I'm lifting something at work, but not always. It doesn’t appear to be linked to a particular action. It’s why it’s so disconcerting, honestly. I can’t pinpoint a trigger for it, which makes me worry it’s something more serious. I haven’t felt any actual pain associated with it, but the unpredictability is a bit unnerving. It’s just a clicking sound, and a feeling of something shifting, as I described. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Mr. Mastrantonio, with a history of fifteen years of physically demanding work, a generally healthy status, and no reported pain, it’s unlikely this is a “serious” issue. However, continued unexplained symptoms warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a lumbar spine X-ray to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core and improve your posture, which may alleviate the sensation you're experiencing. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate, and I agree, it's best to rule things out. An X-ray and physical therapy seem sensible. Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable to me. I’m happy to follow your recommendations. I understand you’re saying it’s probably not serious, and that’s reassuring. But it’s best to be cautious, I suppose. When would I be able to schedule the X-ray? And do you have any recommendations for physical therapists in the area?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve prepared a referral for a lumbar spine X-ray at the imaging center just down the street. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience – the number is on the slip. As for physical therapy, I recommend “Peak Performance Physical Therapy” – they have a good reputation and specialize in musculoskeletal issues. Their number and address are also on the referral. I also want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very helpful. Peak Performance Physical Therapy, excellent. I’ll schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible, and get the X-ray done. And yes, I will certainly contact you immediately if anything changes – any new pain, numbness, or weakness. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this time. Thank you again for your time and attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Mastrantonio. Follow those instructions and we’ll see how you progress. I expect a follow-up appointment in four weeks to discuss the results of the X-ray and your progress with physical therapy. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
