DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I told the lady on the phone – it’s my stomach. Bloated. Feels like I ate a brick. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this, so… can we just figure out what’s wrong and get it fixed? I work long hours.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see. Bloated stomach… and you feel full quickly. Okay. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Ugh, a while. Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, you know? Like… some days it's fine, some days I look six months pregnant. It’s just… annoying. Is that all you need to know? Because I really gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Comes and goes for weeks. Any particular foods seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Foods? I eat what I eat. I’m a pile driver operator, doc, not a gourmet chef. It's not like I'm avoiding anything special. Maybe beans? I had beans a couple of times recently. But I eat beans all the time. Look, I just want something to make it stop, you know? Is it serious? That’s what I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. No specific foods, possibly beans. We need to rule out a few things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Look, I go to the bathroom when I gotta go. Is that what you're asking? You want me to talk about… that? Honestly, doc, this is ridiculous. I came in because my stomach’s puffed up, not for a… a check-up down there. Just tell me if it's something serious. My wife… she handled all this stuff when she was alive. I don’t… I don’t really know what I’m doing here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It’s alright. We can focus on the bloating. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Look, I'm telling you, it's just bloating! Sometimes I feel gassy, sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I feel like I swallowed a balloon. That's it! Is it… is it something I ate? Or is it… something worse? Because if it’s something worse, I need to know. My insurance is private, I can handle things, but I don’t have time for a long drawn-out thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. No blood, sometimes gassy. It could be something simple like dietary changes, or increased gas production. But given it’s been going on for weeks, we should do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything more serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I’m a working man. I don’t have time to be laid up. Just… quick, okay? And tell me what you're looking for. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. I'll be listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and gently pressing on it to check for tenderness or any masses. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but let me know if anything does hurt. Just want to get a feel for things. Do you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Just… uncomfortable. Like a tight balloon, like I said. It's not sharp pain, it's just… there. Honestly, doc, I’m starting to get a headache. Can we just… do the exam? I’d rather just get it over with. And then tell me what’s going on, alright? No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Just relax. Take some deep breaths. Okay. I’m listening for any unusual sounds… and feeling for tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not yet. Feels… normal, I guess. Still uncomfortable. You're poking around a lot, though. Honestly, doc, you’re making me nervous. Is something wrong? You're looking at me funny. Just tell me if it’s something serious, alright? My wife… she always knew what was going on. I feel lost without her, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kristofik, I’m not “looking at you funny.” I’m just concentrating and assessing. I'm not finding any acute tenderness or masses at this point, which is good. Your abdomen is a bit distended, as you mentioned, and I can hear some active bowel sounds, which is also normal. It could be a simple case of gas buildup or a mild digestive issue. But given the persistence, and the fact that it’s impacting your comfort, I’d like to order a basic blood test and a stool sample analysis just to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood test and… stool sample? Seriously? Look, I just want the bloating to stop. I don’t want to spend my life in a clinic. Can’t you just give me something for the gas? Something to… deflate the balloon? Is there a pill for that? Honestly, doc, this is ridiculous. My wife would never have let this go on this long. She handled everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. I truly do. And I wish I could just give you a “quick fix” pill. Unfortunately, bloating can have several causes, and we need to rule out anything serious before we can determine the best course of treatment. A pill to simply “deflate” the balloon might mask an underlying issue. The blood test will check for inflammation and basic organ function. The stool sample will check for any infections or parasites. It’s a fairly routine process, and it will give us a clearer picture. In the meantime, I can recommend an over-the-counter medication like simethicone, which can help relieve gas. And I can discuss some dietary changes that might help – avoiding carbonated beverages and certain gas-producing foods. Would you like to try that, while we wait for the test results?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Simethicone, whatever that is, and… less fizzy drinks. Honestly, I drink coffee black. It's not like I'm guzzling soda. Look, just… get me the paperwork for the tests, alright? And then can I go? I got work to do. And make it quick. I'm wasting daylight here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. Here’s the lab requisition – you can take this to any lab, and they'll draw a small blood sample. And here’s a handout with some helpful dietary tips. It’s fairly straightforward - avoid things like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and carbonated drinks. The results should be back in about 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just… thank you. I guess. Just get me out of here. I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. You take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits. The lab will send the results directly to the clinic. Here's a card with the clinic number. .
