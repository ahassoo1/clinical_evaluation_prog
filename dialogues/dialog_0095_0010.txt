DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I wanted to get it checked out. It’s been… present for a little while, I think. Though, I’m not entirely sure how long, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. It's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the exact timing. We'll figure it out together. When you say swelling, where exactly are you noticing it?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly here, on my neck. It feels… full, I suppose? And sometimes a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… noticeable. It seems to be on both sides, but perhaps a little more prominent on this side. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Jahaad. That's helpful information. “Full” is a good way to describe it. And you said it’s been there for a little while… Has it been gradually getting bigger, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think it’s been getting a little bigger, yes. Very slowly, though. It’s hard to say for certain. I don’t really remember noticing a sudden change, it’s more like… a gradual awareness of it being there. Does that make sense? It's frustrating, I wish I could pinpoint it better.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Gradual changes can be tricky to recall. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been a little more tired lately, perhaps? Though, I’ve also been working quite a bit, so that could be the reason. No… no coughing or difficulty breathing, thankfully. And I haven’t noticed any changes in my voice, that I’m aware of. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I apologize if that’s a silly question.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. It's good you're thinking about this. Fatigue is worth noting. Okay, let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything, thankfully. I can’t recall any instances of allergic reactions, no. I do have… a sensitivity to strong perfumes, but that’s more of an annoyance than an allergy, I suppose. It just makes me a little lightheaded. Is that something we need to consider?
DOCTOR: No, that's good to know, but we'll focus on true allergies for now. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s very infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. And… I used to take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter, but I haven’t been taking it lately. I’m trying to eat a healthier diet instead. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Okay, let’s briefly touch on your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: That's... difficult. I had… chickenpox as a child, of course. And I broke my arm when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I don’t recall any major illnesses or surgeries. I was generally quite healthy, I believe. I'm so sorry, I wish I could provide more details. My memory is truly frustrating at times.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all, Jahaad. We can work with what you remember. How about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she has high blood pressure, I believe. And my father had… some heart issues when he was older. Nothing major, as far as I know. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I’m aware. I don't believe there’s any history of… thyroid problems or anything like that in my family. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Now, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above, Doctor. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s very infrequent. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Jahaad. That gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, focusing on your neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I hope you'll be able to find something, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m just going to listen to your neck with my stethoscope. Please relax. I’m feeling some slight… fullness on both sides, as you mentioned. There’s a little tenderness when I press here on the left side. It doesn’t seem to be particularly large, but it’s definitely there. It feels… somewhat firm, but not hard. And I don’t feel any… significant rigidity. Okay. Just to be thorough, I'm going to check your lymph nodes in other areas as well.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That all sounds… reasonable. I appreciate you being so thorough. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s causing it. I hope it's nothing serious. Please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, the lymph nodes in your armpits feel normal. The ones around your collarbone are also within normal limits. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you have some mild swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck. It could be due to a number of things – a common cold, a minor infection, or even just stress. However, because it's been present for a little while, and you've noticed some fatigue, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wise, Doctor. I’d prefer to be thorough, definitely. Blood tests seem… reasonable. I trust your judgment. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do to prepare for the tests. And… what kind of things are you looking for, if you don’t mind me asking? Just so I have some idea…
DOCTOR: Okay. The blood tests will check your thyroid function, your white blood cell count, and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. We'll also check your general blood work to see if there's anything else that could be contributing to your fatigue. I'm going to order a complete blood count , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel . We'll also check your Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate to look for inflammation. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the tests – just a standard fasting blood draw. The lab will give you specific instructions. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they come back, usually in about a week. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms—like fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss—please contact the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. CBC, TSH, CMP, and ESR… and fasting blood draw. I’ll remember that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And I will contact the office if I notice anything new. A week for the results… that seems reasonable. Thank you, Doctor Vanochten. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Should I schedule the appointment now, or will the lab contact me?
