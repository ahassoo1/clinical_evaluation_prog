DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s becoming quite noticeable, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… progressive, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It wasn't sudden, you see. It started subtly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. Now, lifting things… even just holding my arms up for a while… it’s becoming a struggle. And the eyelids… they seem to get worse each day. It’s mostly both sides, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Both sides… alright. And when did you first start noticing the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was probably… around February, I’d say. Maybe March. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but that’s when I started to feel it consistently. Before that, it was just occasional fatigue, easily explained by a long day at work, you know? But this… this is different. It doesn't go away with rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a sharp pain or anything. It’s more… a general feeling of being unable to exert much force. Like when I used to carry boxes for work, I could do it all day. Now, a few and I'm completely worn out. It feels like my muscles just… give out sooner than they should. And it’s not just my arms, it’s starting to affect my legs too, though less so. It’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: That's good to hear. And yes… actually, now that you mention it, my vision is a little blurry sometimes. It's not constant, but particularly at the end of the day, things seem… less sharp. I initially thought it was just from staring at a computer screen all day, but maybe it’s connected? I haven’t been to an optometrist recently, so I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any difficulty with swallowing, or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no difficulty swallowing. My voice feels normal as well. I haven't noticed anything unusual there, at least. I’ve been trying to pay attention to those things since I started feeling unwell, just in case. It’s good to know I haven’t noticed anything like that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve been quite healthy, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no major surgeries… I’ve always been a fairly active person. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any family history of muscle weakness, neurological problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… My mother had some arthritis in her hands when she was older, but nothing like muscle weakness. My father was healthy as well, though he passed away a few years ago. I don’t recall any history of neurological problems on either side of the family, no. It’s a bit difficult to say for certain, though. We weren’t very close, so I don’t know much about their medical history.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I don't take any prescription medications at all. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but nothing regularly. I prefer to avoid them if I can. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, I don’t have seasonal allergies… I’m quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. Nothing to worry about there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and see your eyelids more closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you look straight ahead, please. Observes eyelids for ptosis, noting degree of drooping on both sides. Hmm. There is some noticeable ptosis, as you mentioned. Now, I'm going to check your pupillary reflexes. Shines a penlight into Mr. Schaust's eyes, observing pupil constriction and reaction time. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light… a bit sluggish, perhaps, but not significantly abnormal. Tests extraocular movements, observing for any limitations. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Squeezes Dr. Sham's hands, trying to apply as much force as possible. I'm trying my best. It's a little difficult, to be honest. It doesn't feel as strong as it used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It is somewhat reduced. Now, can you push against my hands with your arms, like you’re trying to lift something?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Extends arms and attempts to push against Dr. Sham’s hands, exhibiting noticeable weakness. This is… harder than it should be. I can feel it straining, even just doing this. It’s mostly in my biceps, I think. I can feel the effort, but it doesn’t feel like much resistance. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Now, let’s check your legs. Can you sit here and lift your legs up against my resistance?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Attempts to lift legs against Dr. Sham’s resistance, exhibiting moderate weakness. It's getting more difficult the longer I hold them up. It feels like they’re… heavier than usual. My thighs are starting to burn a little. It’s not a sharp pain, just… fatigue. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Tests reflexes in both arms and legs, observing response. Your reflexes are… diminished, but present. Tests sensation to light touch. Sensation is intact. Observes Mr. Schaust walking a few steps. Your gait appears… slightly unsteady. Returns to examining chart Alright. Thank you, Mr. Schaust. That gives me a good starting point.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. It feels strange being tested like that, but I understand it’s necessary. So, what do you think it might be? Is it something serious? I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, your symptoms—the progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, sluggish reflexes—are concerning. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these findings suggest a possible neuromuscular issue. Several possibilities come to mind, including myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder affecting the connection between nerves and muscles. It's also possible this could be related to a vitamin deficiency, or, less commonly, something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for specific antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis. I also recommend an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And yes, that's alright with me. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor, I'm happy to do them. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. What does an EMG involve, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results from the blood tests? I’m a little anxious about all this, to be honest. I’m a bit worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust. It’s good that you’re being proactive. An EMG involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to record their electrical activity. It’s not usually very painful, just a brief discomfort, similar to a pinch. It will take about 30-45 minutes. As for the blood tests, the results usually come back within 3-5 business days. We can schedule the EMG for next week. In the meantime, I'll also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Volkov, who specializes in neuromuscular disorders. She will be able to review the test results and provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A neurologist is probably a good idea. Dr. Volkov, you said? I’ll write that down. 3-5 days for the blood tests… I can manage that. And the EMG next week. Yes, that’s all acceptable. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’m still worried, but I feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be avoiding any activities?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Schaust. It’s important to remember that these tests are just to gather more information, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activities that exacerbate your weakness. Try to get plenty of rest, and maintain a healthy diet. If you notice any new symptoms—difficulty breathing, double vision, or significant difficulty swallowing—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m going to print out the lab orders and a referral for Dr. Volkov. I'll also have my nurse schedule the EMG for you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s all very clear, thank you. Just… a little worried, as you said, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll schedule the EMG and get the blood tests done as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. Takes the papers offered. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Schaust. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in follow-up once we have the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
