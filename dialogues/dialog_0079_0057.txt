DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are twenty years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is right, twenty years old. It’s… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone about it.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s what the other doctors… they said. I don’t… I don’t really understand everything they told me. It was a lot. I just… I know it's cancer.
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears there’s a note here regarding a preliminary pathology report. Frankly, these things are often…misconstrued by patients. Now, could you perhaps elaborate on where you were told this cancer is located, and by whom?
PATIENT: Um… it was at the hospital. Saint Luke’s, I think? And Doctor… Miller? He said it was… in my chest. He showed me the pictures, but… it looked like just shadows. That’s why I'm here, to understand better. I didn’t really… grasp what he was saying. It felt very fast.
DOCTOR: Saint Luke’s… Dr. Miller. Chest, you say. And shadows on the imaging. Right. Do you recall what type of imaging was performed?
PATIENT: Um… there was a machine… a big one. I had to lie still inside it. It was… loud. And then they took some pictures. Was it… an X-ray? I think that's what the nurse said, before the pictures. But there was another one, too. A different machine. I don’t know which one was which. They did both, I think.
DOCTOR: It appears we’re dealing with a rather…vague recollection of events. Very well. It sounds like you had both a chest X-ray and a CT scan performed. Now, Ms. Luft, do you currently experience any symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I’ve been… very tired lately. More tired than usual. And I have a cough. It doesn’t go away. It hurts sometimes, when I breathe deep. Also… my chest feels tight. Like someone is… sitting on it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, persistent cough, and chest tightness. Hmm. And how long have these symptoms been present?
PATIENT: Oh… about two months, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, just the tiredness. Then the cough came, and then the tightness. I didn't think much of it at first, just thought I was getting sick with a cold. But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Two months. And have you experienced any weight loss, fever, night sweats, or noticed any blood when you cough?
PATIENT: I… I haven't had a fever, no. And I haven’t noticed any blood when I cough. But… I have lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel… looser. I didn’t really pay attention until my mom said something. She said I looked… thinner. But I haven’t been eating much, I guess. Not because I’m sick, just… not hungry.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, unintentional, and a lack of appetite. Right. Now, Ms. Luft, let's delve into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing before this. I've always been… healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood things, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. Never been in the hospital before this time. My mom always said I was strong. She’s… she’s probably worried now.
DOCTOR: No prior medical history. Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the recent tests at Saint Luke’s?
PATIENT: No, sir. Like I said, nothing. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital before. I… I don’t like hospitals. They make me nervous. My mom says I get anxious easily. It’s silly, I know. But… it’s true.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My… my dad… he passed away a few years ago. He had… heart problems. That’s what they said. And my grandma, on my mom's side, she had… diabetes, I think? She needed shots to help her. I don’t know much about it. My mom doesn’t really talk about it much. It makes her sad.
DOCTOR: Cardiac history in father, diabetes in maternal grandmother. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. My mom would… well, she wouldn't be happy. I… I don’t need any of that. I just want to be healthy. I want to understand what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Luft, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will listen to your lungs and heart, and palpate your chest. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Just… please be gentle? It hurts a little to breathe deep, like you said.
DOCTOR: Of course. Now, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Hmm. And again… Heart sounds are within normal limits, though slightly tachycardic. There’s some tenderness to palpation here, on the left side. Wheezing auscultated bilaterally, slight left-sided chest tenderness. I'd like to review your preliminary pathology report on the computer. Please remain still.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is… is it bad? What does the report say? Is it… serious? I’m… I’m scared.
DOCTOR: The report indicates the presence of… atypical cells identified via biopsy. The exact classification requires further investigation. This is… preliminary. It appears you have a mass in your chest. Further testing is required to determine the exact nature of this mass. We will need a CT scan with contrast, and a biopsy of any enlarged lymph nodes. It is too early to definitively diagnose cancer, Ms. Luft, but we must proceed with a thorough workup to determine the cause of these findings.
PATIENT: A mass…? What does that… what does that mean? Is it… is it definitely cancer then? I don't understand… contrast? Biopsy…? I’m… I’m really scared, Doctor. What’s going to happen?
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, please compose yourself. Becoming hysterical will not aid in the diagnostic process. A "mass" simply means an abnormal growth. The CT scan with contrast will provide a more detailed image of the mass, and the biopsy will allow us to examine the cells under a microscope to determine their nature. I understand you are frightened, but it is crucial to remain calm and allow me to guide you through the necessary steps. We will schedule the CT scan immediately. I am also going to order some blood work to assess your overall health. We will discuss the results once they are available. For now, I will refer you to a pulmonologist and an oncologist for further evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist…? Oncologist…? That sounds… serious. Are you saying… are you saying it is cancer, Doctor? I don't… I don't understand all those words. And what will they… what will they do? I just… I want to know what's happening to me. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, I understand your anxiety, but you are requesting a definitive diagnosis before we have gathered sufficient information. A pulmonologist specializes in lung conditions, and an oncologist specializes in cancer treatment. Their involvement does not automatically equate to a cancer diagnosis. They are necessary to rule out other possibilities and ensure you receive the appropriate care, whatever the cause may be. I will have my secretary schedule appointments with both specialists. In the meantime, I recommend you refrain from self-diagnosing via the internet. It will only exacerbate your anxiety. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I… I just feel really… scared and confused. I guess I'll… I’ll wait for the appointments. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My secretary will contact you with the appointment details. I’ve ordered the necessary tests and referrals. Please refrain from contacting my office with questions regarding scheduling. Next patient. .
