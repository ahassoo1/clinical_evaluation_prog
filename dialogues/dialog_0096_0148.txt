DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. It’s… a pain. Down there. It’s not my pain, you understand. It’s… a relative’s. My son, actually. He asked me to come. He’s… rather shy.
DOCTOR: A relative’s pain… and he sent you?
PATIENT: Yes, it is… unusual, I realize. He felt it was… best if someone else explained. He gets very flustered talking about these things. I’m his mother. I hope that’s alright. I’m afraid I don’t have a great deal of… specific information. It just started a few days ago, he thinks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, mothers often know best. A few days ago… and where, specifically, is this pain located?
PATIENT: Oh dear. He didn’t… go into a lot of detail. Somewhere… low down. In the… groin, I suppose? That's the word he used. It’s not a sharp pain, he said. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes… uncomfortable. He’s been trying to ignore it, but it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Dull ache in the groin… ignoring it, you say. Hmm. Has he noticed any… swelling?
PATIENT: Swelling? I… don’t recall him mentioning swelling. He didn’t say anything about that, no. He mostly talked about the discomfort and how it’s making him… self-conscious, if you understand. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s all a bit… vague.
DOCTOR: It's alright, alright. These things happen. Now, is he experiencing any pain with urination?
PATIENT: Urination… Oh, goodness. I don’t believe so. No, he didn't mention any trouble with it, or pain during it. He does go more often, perhaps? Now that you mention it, he’s been rushing to the bathroom a bit more frequently. But I assumed that was just… nerves.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency… Alright. And any fever, chills, or discharge of any kind?
PATIENT: Oh my. Discharge? No, definitely not. He would have said something. And no fever, no chills. He's been feeling a little tired, perhaps, but he works very hard, so… I truly don’t think so. It’s mostly just the ache and the… frequent trips to the bathroom. He’s a very private young man, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like it could be a number of things. We really need to examine him to get a better idea. Is he here with you today, Ms. Stepbro?
PATIENT: No, he… he's waiting outside. He was quite anxious about coming, and didn’t want to… overwhelm himself. He asked me to… pave the way, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Pave the way… Well. Tell you what, Ms. Stepbro. You wait here, and I’ll go out and speak with your son myself. It will likely be quicker, and he needs to understand that a proper examination is necessary. It won’t do to tiptoe around things.
PATIENT: That… that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. He can be… stubborn at times. Thank you. I truly appreciate you taking the time. I’ll just… sit here quietly then.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll be right back. And Ms. Stepbro... try not to worry unduly. It's likely nothing serious. .
PATIENT: .
