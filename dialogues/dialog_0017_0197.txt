DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you're 70 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, seventy. Though I feel younger most days! I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I believe? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber and Lyft. I just want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: A medical card for ride-sharing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. My son, he helped me with the application online, and it said I needed to come get checked out by a doctor first. Something about being a commercial driver, I think he called it. Honestly, all this computer stuff… it goes over my head. I just want to be sure everything is alright and I can keep working. It helps me stay busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. So, this isn’t due to any specific illness or injury, but rather a requirement for… commercial driving verification. I see. To fulfill this requirement, I will need to conduct a basic physical examination and review your medical history. It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Sciarotta, though I find it rather… unnecessary for a service like that. Have you had a physical recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. It’s been… a while. Probably since I divorced, if I’m being honest. My ex-husband always took care of those things. I mostly just go to the doctor when something really hurts. I’m a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. I still help my son with his logging business sometimes, you know, running equipment. So I think I’m okay, but I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Understandable. We'll proceed with a standard examination then. Let’s begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. No diabetes, no. My blood sugar’s always been fine. My mother had high blood pressure, but I’ve never been officially told I have it. I get it checked at the pharmacy sometimes, when I pick up my prescriptions, and the numbers are usually okay. My heart… well, it feels alright. Gets a little fluttery sometimes when I’m stressed, but nothing serious. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that’s about it. Oh! And I used to get terrible migraines, but those haven’t bothered me in years. They just disappeared.
DOCTOR: Alright. Migraines resolved… interesting. And this fall, when precisely did that occur?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it was… 2021, I think. November of 2021. I was helping my son clear some brush, and I tripped over a root. Nasty break, needed a cast for a few months. They said it healed up nicely, and it hasn’t bothered me much since. Just a little stiff sometimes when the weather changes, you know? I mostly just ignore it. It’s just old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries, Mrs. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: Just the wrist, Doctor. That was it. They had to put in a plate and some screws. They took the plate out a year later, though. Said it wasn't necessary long-term. It was a good doctor, very kind. Everything healed up well, I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Honestly, I’m a pretty lucky woman. I’ve always been careful.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… my mother, like I said, had high blood pressure. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was still young, so I don't remember a lot of details. My brother… he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s not very healthy. He smokes too much, always has. And my sister… she had some sort of arthritis, I think, but I don't know much about that either. We weren't very close. Is that enough? I’m not very good with remembering all that.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. For my arthritis. It’s a little pill, helps with the stiffness in my hands and knees. It’s called… let me see… meloxicam, I think. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when it’s really bad, but not very often. Other than that, just vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes vitamin D in the winter. Is that all? I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Meloxicam, as needed ibuprofen… satisfactory. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My son always asks me, but I always tell him the same thing. I'm pretty tough, I think! Never had much trouble with allergies or anything like that. Is that good? I’m glad I don't have allergies. It would be terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. Now, if you don't mind, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m a little worried about my blood pressure though. It gets high when I’m nervous, and you've been asking a lot of questions!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 88. Not ideal, but not alarming. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are within normal limits. Balance is stable. Coordination… slightly diminished, but acceptable for her age. Neurological assessment appears unremarkable. Overall, your physical examination is… within acceptable parameters, considering your age and reported history.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear, Doctor. Though I was worried about my blood pressure. Does that mean I can go ahead and do the ride-sharing? I just want to make sure I'm not a danger to anyone, you know? And I really need to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, while your examination isn't concerning, your elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. I recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. As for your ride-sharing… legally, you will need a physician's clearance stating you are fit to drive commercially. Given your blood pressure reading, I am hesitant to provide that clearance at this time. I suggest postponing your ride-sharing activities until your blood pressure is properly controlled. It's a matter of public safety, and my professional responsibility. I will document my findings and provide you with a referral to a cardiologist.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A cardiologist? That sounds serious. I just wanted to drive a few people around, you know? Keep myself busy. I don't want to cause any trouble, and I definitely don't want to be a danger to anyone. But my son… he’s counting on me. He said it would help with expenses. Is there anything… anything at all I can do? Maybe just check it again in a few days? I could try to relax more, I suppose. I don't want to give up on this just yet. What does he mean by “properly controlled”? I don't even know what that means.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, I understand your concerns, but I cannot compromise my professional judgment. “Properly controlled” means achieving a consistent blood pressure reading within the normal range, ideally below 140/90, through lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction – or, if necessary, medication. I am not comfortable providing medical clearance without evidence of stable blood pressure control. A single repeat reading in a few days is insufficient. A thorough cardiovascular evaluation is necessary, and I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist as soon as possible. I can provide you with a referral, and I will document my findings in detail. It is for your own safety, and the safety of others. We’ve spent quite enough time on this matter. Do you have any further questions, or shall I prepare the referral?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… the referral, please. If you think it’s best. I guess I’ll have to tell my son. He won’t be happy. Thank you, Doctor… I suppose. This is all very… upsetting. It’s just… I wanted to feel useful, you know? .
