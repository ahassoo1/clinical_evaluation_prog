DOCTOR: Hi Lonell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today to… to have a determination, I believe, for home health services. Or hospice, perhaps. My… my wife suggested I come, to see if I am eligible. She handles most of these things, you understand. It is about getting help at home, if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re exploring options for support at home, potentially including home health or hospice. That's a really good step, and it's wonderful that you have your wife helping with this. Let’s talk a bit about what’s been going on that makes you think you might need some extra help. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been difficult for you lately?
PATIENT: Difficult… well. It is not one thing, exactly. My… my energy levels are lower than they once were. I tire easily, even with simple tasks. And… and my appetite has diminished somewhat. I used to enjoy cooking, quite a lot, but now… it feels like a chore. Also, there is a little… discomfort. Not pain, precisely, but a constant… awareness. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes. My wife says I should not attempt to do too much, but… one likes to maintain some independence, you see.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand wanting to maintain your independence. It's completely natural. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of things – lower energy, decreased appetite, and some discomfort that's affecting your sleep. That definitely warrants a closer look. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it began, I believe, approximately three months ago. It was… gradual, at first. A slight lessening of energy. I attributed it to the change of seasons, honestly. But then the appetite began to… to wane. And the discomfort… that arrived about a month ago, perhaps six weeks. It is… persistent, but not severe. I do not require medication, if that is what you are asking. Just… a nagging sensation. My wife insisted I see you, said it was time to investigate. She is very… thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Three months of gradually worsening symptoms – that helps narrow things down. And it's smart of your wife to encourage you to get checked out. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia, many years ago. Perhaps twenty years. I recovered fully, thankfully. And… and I had my gallbladder removed, about fifteen years ago. Beyond that… no. No major illnesses, no chronic conditions. I do take a medication for my blood pressure, a small dose. Losartan, I believe it is called. And… and I had a rather nasty break in my wrist, about ten years ago. But that is fully healed, of course. I am otherwise, I believe, quite healthy. Or was healthy. Before all of this, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and gallbladder removal in the past, currently taking Losartan for blood pressure, and a healed wrist fracture. That’s good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I can take most anything without issue. My wife has several, mind you – pollen, shellfish… a rather extensive list, actually. But I am fortunate in that regard. No reactions, no hives, no difficulty breathing… nothing of the sort. I believe I have a fairly robust constitution. Or had a robust constitution. Before… you understand. It is the fatigue that is most concerning, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Fatigue can be very disruptive. And it’s good to know about the lack of allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My father… he lived to a good age, eighty-nine. He passed away peacefully in his sleep. He had… heart trouble, towards the end. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, quite severely. And my sister… she had breast cancer, several years ago. She is in remission now, thankfully. Beyond that… no major illnesses that I am aware of. My family… we were generally quite healthy, all things considered. Or were healthy. It is… disheartening to see things change. Especially with age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother, and your sister’s history of breast cancer. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, just a couple of more questions before we move onto a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Hmm. I am… retired now, you see. I used to be a surgeon, as you know. Very demanding work. Now… I spend my time gardening, reading, and occasionally… a little painting. I do not drink alcohol, and I have never smoked. I live with my wife, of course. We enjoy… quiet evenings at home. We do not have frequent visitors. Mostly, we keep to ourselves. It is… a peaceful existence. Or was a peaceful existence. Before… all of this. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, and it's great you've been able to transition into a relaxing retirement. No alcohol or smoking is excellent. Okay, before we move on, just to confirm - are you currently experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, Doctor. None whatsoever. And no chest pain. I have… a discomfort, as I mentioned, but not pain. As for weight loss… yes. My wife has been weighing me, and she says I have lost approximately ten pounds over the last two months. I had not noticed it myself, to be honest. I do not have a particularly large appetite these days, as you know. But ten pounds… that is rather significant, isn't it? It is… concerning, I suppose. It all feels rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, ten pounds of unintentional weight loss over two months is significant and definitely something we need to investigate. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Lonell, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, abdomen, and a neurological assessment. It shouldn't take too long. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. A physical exam is… sensible, naturally. I understand the need for it. Please proceed at your convenience. I shall endeavor to remain still, and answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability. It is… reassuring to know you are taking this seriously. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take some deep breaths for me. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds at the bases. That could be related to your age or just your overall energy level. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, no masses. A little tenderness in the upper right quadrant, but not significant. Finally, I'm going to check your neurological reflexes and strength. Reflexes are normal. Strength is good in all extremities, although a little diminished overall. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but the diminished breath sounds, slight tenderness in your abdomen, and overall diminished strength, combined with your weight loss and fatigue, are concerning. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… prudent. Blood work and a chest X-ray seem… entirely sensible. I trust your judgment, of course. Please proceed as you see fit. I would… like to know the results as soon as possible, if that is not too much to ask. The uncertainty is… unsettling, naturally. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… concern.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern, and I will expedite the orders for the blood work and chest X-ray. The lab results should be back within a couple of business days, and the X-ray results should be available a bit quicker, usually within 24 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to document everything we've discussed today. I'm also going to write a referral for a consultation with a gastroenterologist, given the slight tenderness in your abdomen. It's best to rule out any potential digestive issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A consultation with a gastroenterologist seems… wise. It is best to be thorough, as you say. I agree that ruling out any digestive issues is… sensible. Please proceed with the referral. I shall await the results of the blood work and X-ray, and the… appointment. I trust your judgment entirely. And… thank you. For your time, your concern, and your… thoroughness. It is… reassuring to know you are taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lonell. I’m glad I could help, and I will certainly keep you updated as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’ve sent the referrals to the lab and gastroenterologist. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the blood work, and my office will reach out to schedule the gastroenterology appointment once we receive confirmation from their office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I do not have any further questions at this time. I shall await contact from the lab and your office. Thank you again for your… patience, your time, and your concern. It is… reassuring to know I am in good hands. I believe that is all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lonell. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
