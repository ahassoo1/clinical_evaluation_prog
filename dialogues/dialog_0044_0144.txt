DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's...Asami, was it? Yes. Well, honestly? My niece thought I should come. She worries too much, that one. Says I need to get “checked out.” I feel fine, mostly. Just… curious, I suppose. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Asami. And that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s good you’re being proactive, even if it’s just out of curiosity, or because your niece is looking out for you. It's very common to get a check-up after a while. “Checked out” can mean a lot of things, though. To start, can you tell me a little more about what specifically your niece was worried about, or what prompted her to suggest you come in?
PATIENT: Oh, she just rambles on, really. Something about… memory, I think? Said I asked her the same question three times last week. Honestly, I don't remember asking her three times. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. She makes a big deal out of everything. And she keeps saying something about how Momma had… troubles, later in life. But Momma was just… old. Everyone gets a little forgetful, don’t they? It’s not like it’s a problem.
DOCTOR: You're right, Ms. Calvery, some forgetfulness is perfectly normal as we get older. It’s good you’re able to recognize that. But it’s also good your niece is paying attention, and it’s smart to rule things out. It sounds like the memory concerns are what brought you in today. Just to get a better picture, could you describe some of the other things you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Experiencing? What do you mean? I mean, I get up, I eat, I watch my stories… I go to the market when I need things. It's all pretty… normal. I haven’t been sick sick, if that's what you’re asking. No fevers, no aches, nothing like that. Just… getting older, I guess. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I feel perfectly capable.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. And it’s good to hear you feel capable. We're not necessarily looking for something wrong, just gathering information to get a complete picture. Sometimes changes happen gradually, and it’s easy to miss them. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately, besides just feeling normal?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I used to be a much bigger eater, if that’s what you mean. But honestly, cooking for one is… a bother. I mostly have soup and sandwiches. And leftovers. I don’t have much of a sweet tooth anymore either. Used to love my pastries, but they just don't appeal like they used to. Not that I need to lose weight, mind you. I’ve always been a… solid woman.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s common for appetite to change as we get older, or when life gets busy. And you’re right, it's perfectly normal. Now, have you noticed any trouble with your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Well, things aren't as sharp as they used to be, I suppose. I need to hold my book closer to read, and the subtitles on the stories are getting smaller all the time! But I've always needed glasses, so it's not new. I just… haven't bothered getting a new prescription. It’s a hassle, you know? Going to the eye doctor, picking out frames... It’s just more trouble than it’s worth, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Calvery. It can be a lot to keep up with. Okay, let’s move on. Have you been experiencing any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. Maybe a little tension sometimes, if I’m watching a particularly… dramatic story. But nothing a little lie-down and a cup of tea can’t fix. I used to get migraines when I was younger, awful things, but those haven’t bothered me in years. My husband used to make me chamomile tea when I had a migraine… good man, he was.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like he was a very caring man. Now, focusing back on you, have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, now that you mention it. People mumble these days, don't they? Or maybe it's just me. My son always tells me to turn up the television. And sometimes at church, I have trouble understanding the sermon. But it's not… bad, you know? I can still hear perfectly well when someone speaks clearly, directly to me. It's just… background noise, and mumbling. And youngsters always have the music so loud! Honestly, it’s probably just everyone else.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. It’s common for hearing to change as we get older, and you’re right, sometimes it is everyone else! One more question for now. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Hmm. Sometimes my feet feel a little… cold, especially in the winter. But that’s just the circulation, I think. I always have cold feet. And my hands… well, sometimes they ache a little, after I’ve been gardening. But I’ve always been a bit rough on my hands, you know? From all the work. Nothing that a little cream can’t fix. They’ve seen a lot of life, these hands.
DOCTOR: They certainly have, Ms. Calvery. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered from that. And my doctor always told me I had high blood pressure, but he put me on some pills, and I took them for a while. I don't even remember what they were called now. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much, so I can't really remember everything. It was all a long time ago, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. We can look through your records to confirm. Do you remember approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking me something. It must have been… oh, goodness. When my son was still in school, I think? He's… let me think… he's 52 now. So… maybe 30 years ago? More than that, even. It was a long, long time ago. It was a pretty simple surgery, though. I didn’t have any trouble with it. I just remember being glad to be home and back in my own bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. That helps. And do you currently take any medications, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Now… I take a little calcium for my bones, my niece told me I should. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, when I remember. But mostly, no. I try to eat a good diet, and I don’t like taking a lot of pills. They just make me feel… sluggish. I prefer to let nature take its course, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Calvery. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I had a wisdom tooth pulled when I was young, but that doesn't really count as surgery, does it? And I had a… a mole removed from my back, years ago. But that was tiny, just a little snip. Nothing major, I assure you. I’ve never been one for hospitals or surgery. Give me a quiet evening at home any day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a complicated question. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, later in life. And my brother, he had… well, he had some kind of trouble with his memory, when he got older. But honestly, everyone gets a little forgetful, don't they? It’s hard to say what’s just normal aging and what’s… something else. It’s been a long time, and I don’t remember everything so clearly anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything. It sounds like there’s a history of heart trouble, diabetes, and some memory issues in your family. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. It’s a terrible habit, in my opinion. Makes you smell awful, and it's bad for your health. I always told him that, and I’m glad he listened. My mother always said a healthy life is a long life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Calvery. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy, usually. A little bit of red wine, for my health, you know? I read somewhere it’s good for your heart. But I don’t drink very often, maybe once a week, if that. I’m not much of a drinker. A little bit is alright, but I don’t need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. And lastly, can you tell me a little bit about your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I mostly stay at home. I like to watch my stories on television, and I do a little gardening when the weather is nice. I go to church on Sundays, when I’m feeling up to it. And sometimes my niece comes over, and we have tea and chat. I used to be more active, but I’ve slowed down a little bit as I’ve gotten older. It’s hard to get around like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, I suppose. But please be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t poke around too much! I never was one for doctors’ exams. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I will be very gentle. We'll take things slow. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not alarmingly so, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not concerning at this time, but again, something we’ll monitor. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for someone your age. Lastly, I’ll quickly assess your balance. Your balance is a little unsteady, but you're able to walk without assistance. Okay, Ms. Calvery. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal for your age, but there are a few things we’ll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Investigate further? That doesn’t sound good. What exactly are you investigating? Is something wrong? I told you I felt fine! My niece just worries too much, I swear.
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Ms. Calvery. “Investigate further” just means we’ll do a few tests to get a more complete picture. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong. The elevated blood pressure, the murmur I heard, and the slight unsteadiness in your balance are things we want to check out. I recommend we order some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And given your niece's concerns about memory, and to rule out any underlying issues, I’d like to order a cognitive assessment. That’s just a simple test to check your thinking and memory skills. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. And blood work? I hate needles! And a cognitive assessment… is that like a… a brain test? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think my niece was right to worry, but this is all a bit much. Is it really necessary? Maybe I should just… go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Calvery. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize if it's overwhelming. But these tests are relatively simple and can give us valuable information about your overall health. The blood work is just a small sample, and we can minimize the discomfort. And the cognitive assessment is not like a scary brain test – it’s just a series of questions and tasks to assess your thinking and memory skills. It helps us understand if there are any areas we need to focus on. We can take things one step at a time. We can start with just the blood work if that’s more comfortable for you. And if the results are normal, we don’t have to proceed with the other tests. I want to assure you that my goal is to ensure you’re healthy and happy. And these tests are just a tool to help us achieve that. Would you be willing to start with the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Just the blood work. But promise me it won’t be too painful. And can I have a little something to eat afterward? I always get a little shaky when they take blood. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not what I want to hear. But promise me, Doctor, you’ll explain everything clearly. No medical jargon, please. I don’t understand half of what doctors say.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I promise I’ll do everything I can to make the blood work as comfortable as possible. And I absolutely promise no medical jargon. I’ll explain everything in plain language, so you understand exactly what’s going on. We can take it slow, and I'll be right there with you to answer any questions you have. The lab technician will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It might sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t be too painful. Afterward, you can definitely have something to eat. We have some crackers and juice available in the waiting room, or you can go home and have a meal if you prefer. I’ll write you a lab order now. Do you have any allergies to latex or any bleeding disorders that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, thankfully. And I don’t think so, bleeding disorders. My mother had a bit of trouble clotting when she was younger, but I never did. Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much about it. It was a long time ago, and she never said it was serious. Just a bit of bruising, I think. But I think it’s alright, I’ve always healed quickly. Just… be careful, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. No known allergies or bleeding disorders – that’s good. I'll make a note of that. Here is your lab order. Please take this to the lab technician, and they will draw your blood. The results should be back in a few days. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I hope everything is alright. I suppose I'll go face the needle now. Wish me luck.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry, you’ll do just fine. You’re a strong woman. If you have any questions or concerns at all before the results are back, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. And please, take care. I’ll be in touch soon.
