DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me somethin’ awful lately. Lower back, mostly. Feels kinda weak, you know? And achy. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, but it’s gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Weak and achy, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… like someone’s got a little weight on it all the time, even when they don’t. And sometimes it feels… sharp. Not all the time, but enough to make me careful when I bend over. It makes it hard to do things, even just gettin’ out of a chair. My daughter, she keeps tellin’ me to come see someone. She's right, I suppose. I just… don't like complainin’. But it’s gettin’ harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you finally came in. Ignoring things usually just makes them worse, you know. Now, how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's true, I suppose. Let me think... It started… maybe six, seven months ago? Just a little stiffness, really. I figured I just slept wrong. But it didn’t go away. And like I said, it's been gettin' worse the last couple of months. Definitely worse. I can't remember exactly when it started feelin' sharp, but that’s new. And it's… constant, now, kinda. Not a bad pain all the time, just… there. You know?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Six or seven months, gradually worsening… and the sharpness is recent. Alright. Now, does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things, Doctor. Bendin’ over, definitely. Pickin’ things up off the floor is a real struggle. And… standin’ for too long. I used to like walkin’ in the garden, but I can’t do much of that anymore. Sittin’ for too long isn’t good either, actually. It gets stiff then, too. It's just… almost everything makes it worse, to be honest. Except lyin' down, usually. That helps. But I can’t just lie in bed all day!
DOCTOR: Right. So, pretty much any activity aggravates it, and lying down is the only thing that provides relief. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain goin' down my legs. Not that I've noticed, anyway. It's all in my back. Sometimes it feels like it goes around my hips a little, but not down my legs. No numbness or… tingly feelings, either. Just the ache and the sharp bits in my back. It's just… a bad back, I guess. I never used to have trouble with my back. I used to be able to lift heavy things, you know? It's just… old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. Well, we’ll see about that. Now, have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… no, not really. Everything’s workin’ normal, if you know what I mean. No problems there. I was a little… worried when you asked about my legs, but no, everything’s alright downstairs. Sorry to be so blunt, but I don’t like beatin’ around the bush.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize. It’s important information. Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, I think. It's been hot lately. And no chills. And I… I haven't lost any weight, actually. Maybe a little, but I haven’t been eatin’ as much lately ‘cause… well, ‘cause it hurts to move around too much, so I don’t have much of an appetite. But I haven’t been tryin’ to lose weight, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. The doctor put me on some pills for it, and I took ‘em for a long time. But he took me off ‘em a few years back, said I was doin’ okay. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was a boy, fallin’ out of a tree. But that healed up fine. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. Until this back…
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. High blood pressure, treated and resolved. Broken wrist as a child. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not a one. I always avoided ‘em if I could. Didn't like the thought of someone cuttin' me open! And… my daughter, she always said I was too stubborn to let anyone help me. She might be right. But no, no surgeries. Just the pills for my blood pressure, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she had arthritis in her hands when she got older. Bad arthritis, she couldn’t make a fist anymore. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had a bad back when he was workin’ in the fields. Lots of heavy liftin’, you know? Other than that… not that I can remember. We weren’t a family that talked about our health much. Mostly just… tried to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… oh, you mean… like, do I drink or smoke? No, no, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to smoke a little, but she quit years ago. And I don’t drink much either. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feelin’ fancy. Mostly I just like to… read, and garden, when my back lets me. I used to go to the coffee shop every day, but… well, it's hard to get around these days. I live alone now, since my wife passed away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. My daughter always asks me that question, too. She worries about me, you know? Always has. No, no allergies. Just… a bad back. And maybe a little bit of stubbornness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to have you lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to check your range of motion, reflexes, and feel your back to see where the pain is coming from. It may be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything is too painful.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I’ll lie down. It might be a little hard, but I’ll try. Just let me know if you want me to move a certain way. And… you’re right, please tell me if it's too much. I don’t want to make it worse. Where is the table?
DOCTOR: Right over there. If you could lie on your stomach first, please. I’m going to start with palpation—just feeling your back to identify the source of the pain. Then we’ll move onto range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay. Here goes... There we go. It's not so easy gettin' old, you know? Alright, go ahead. Just tell me what you're doin' as you go, if you don't mind. I like to know what's happenin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just feeling along your spine and the muscles on either side to see if I can pinpoint where the pain is the worst. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes… yes, that’s it. Right there. Just a little to the left of my spine. That’s where it’s been botherin’ me the most. Not a sharp pain, exactly, but… a deep ache. Like someone’s pressin’ down on it. And… it kinda radiates a little bit around my hips when you push there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tenderness over the lumbar spine, left side, with radiation to the hips. Alright, I’m just checking for any other areas of tenderness. Now I’m going to ask you to try and bend forward, if you can. Slowly, and only as far as comfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, I’ll try… Ooh… that’s not so good. It kinda… catches, you know? Not a sharp pain, but… it’s uncomfortable. And it feels like somethin’s pullin’ in my back when I do that. I can’t go very far, Doctor. It’s too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, stop there. That’s enough. Limited range of motion with discomfort on forward flexion. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Please just relax your legs. I’m going to tap on your tendons with this little hammer.
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes. Sounds important. This little hammer doesn’t hurt, does it? My daughter always used to tease me about my reflexes bein’ slow. She said I was gettin’ like an old turtle.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't. Just relax. Hmm. Patellar reflexes are present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. And now I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me when you feel me touch your legs?
PATIENT: Okay… touch my legs? Yes, I can feel that. There… and there. Both feel about the same. No numbness or tingly feelings, like I said. My legs are fine, it’s just my back that’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Vankampen, based on the physical exam, it appears you have a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by age-related changes and possibly some deconditioning. The diminished reflexes and slight tenderness are consistent with that. However, given your age, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some x-rays of your lumbar spine to check for any underlying issues, like arthritis or compression fractures.
PATIENT: X-rays… okay. That sounds… sensible. I don’t mind gettin’ some pictures taken, if it’ll help figure things out. Compression… fractures? Is that bad, Doctor? I just want to know what's goin' on, and what we can do about it. I don’t want to be stuck in bed forever.
DOCTOR: Compression fractures can be, but they're not always serious. We need to see the images to determine if that's what's going on. It could be something as simple as muscle strain, but it's best to be thorough. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. I also recommend physical therapy once we get the x-ray results. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and improve your range of motion. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds… good. I always liked bein’ active, even if I can’t do as much these days. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… yes, that would be helpful. Um… let me think. Will the x-rays hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? And… will the physical therapy be expensive? My wife… she always took care of the bills, and I’m not very good with those things.
DOCTOR: No, the x-rays won’t hurt. It’s just a quick imaging procedure. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. As for physical therapy… it can be expensive, yes. However, there are programs that can help with the cost, depending on your income. I’ll have my assistant give you some information about those programs when you leave. I'm also going to write a referral to a physical therapist now, so you'll be ready to go once we have the x-ray results. Any other questions, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you for listenin’ to me, and takin’ the time to figure things out. I appreciate it. My daughter will be happy to hear we’re gettin’ some x-rays done. She always worries about me, you know? So… I guess I just wait for the call about the x-rays, and then we’ll talk about physical therapy? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly right. My assistant will schedule the x-rays for you before you leave, and we’ll call you with the results as soon as we have them. In the meantime, try to rest, avoid strenuous activity, and take the medication as prescribed. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Vankampen.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better. I appreciate your help. And… please tell your assistant to just call me when they have a time for the x-rays. I'm not very good with appointments, you know? Well, I guess that's all for now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. My assistant will take care of it. Have a good day, Mr. Vankampen. .
