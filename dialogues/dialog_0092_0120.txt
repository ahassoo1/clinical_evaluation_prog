DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do small talk. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he was a very important man, and things just… weren’t simple then, if you know what I mean. I don't want any trouble this time around. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, that is a very good starting point. It sounds like you're hoping to conceive and would like to ensure a smooth pregnancy, especially considering past complexities. We want to make this as stress-free as possible for you. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about your previous pregnancy experiences?
PATIENT: Experiences? Honestly, it was all a blur. A lot of… doctors, and tests, and him being… unavailable. It wasn't a pleasant time, let's just say that. I don't remember specifics. Why does it even matter, anyway? I just want a baby now. Can't we just… skip to the part where you tell me what I need to do to make that happen? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire to get straight to the point, Ms. Villarreal. It's perfectly alright if you don't want to delve into past details right now. However, some information about previous pregnancies can help us identify potential challenges and ensure a healthier pregnancy this time around. To start, even a general idea of how many pregnancies you've had, and whether they resulted in a live birth, would be helpful. And just to be thorough, could you tell me if you’ve had any previous surgeries or significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. One. Just the one. Didn't… end well. And surgeries… honestly, I’ve lost track. Lots of little things over the years. Nothing major, I don't think. Honestly, I mostly just went to the best doctors, and they fixed things. I don't need a history lesson, I need results. Are you going to run some tests, or...? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Villarreal. We will definitely be running some tests. Before we do that, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… vitamins. You know, the usual. Prenatal ones, now that I'm… trying. And allergies… dust, I think. Maybe pollen. Nothing serious. Look, are we done with the questions yet? This is ridiculous. I just want to know what I need to do to get pregnant, and if there's anything I need to worry about. I don’t even know why I bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: We're almost there, Ms. Villarreal. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss a plan. Have you had any previous issues with irregular periods, or any pain associated with your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Irregular? Honestly, who keeps track of that? It comes and goes. And pain… sometimes. All women have pain, don’t they? It’s normal. Look, is this going anywhere? I feel like I’m giving you my life story and you're just asking questions. I'm a busy woman, you know. I don't have time for this. Just tell me what tests I need, and let's get it over with. I have a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. I apologize if the questions feel extensive. It's simply my responsibility to ensure we have a complete picture before proceeding. To streamline things, let's focus on some basic tests to begin. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hormone panel to assess your overall health and ovarian function. We'll also perform a pelvic exam. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it done. Quickly. And make sure it doesn’t mess up my schedule. I have a charity gala next week, and I need to look presentable. I don’t want any… surprises. So, what happens next? Do I just go to the lab? And will it take long? Honestly, the less information I have to deal with, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I’ve just written the orders for the lab tests. You’ll need to go to the lab, and they’ll draw some blood samples. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. I'll have my nurse give you the lab request form and directions. After the lab results come back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a personalized plan. We can also discuss any lifestyle adjustments that might be beneficial. In the meantime, are you currently taking any folic acid supplements?
PATIENT: Folic… something? Oh, the prenatal vitamins! Yes, I’ve been taking those like you said. Look, is that it? Can I go now? I really, really need to go. I have a very important appointment. And please, try not to take too long calling with the results. I have people waiting on me. Honestly, this whole thing is just… inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, that is all for today. My nurse will provide you with the lab request form and directions. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in. I wish you all the best, and we'll be in touch shortly. .
