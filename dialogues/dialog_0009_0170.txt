DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kaelyn Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… getting this life insurance thing done. They sent me here for an exam, that’s all. Trying to get it over with, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a life insurance physical. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly get that done for you. It's good you're taking care of this. Just to be thorough, even though it’s for insurance purposes, I'd like to ask a few questions to get a good overall picture of your health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll do my best to be efficient. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. The divorce was… stressful, the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high then, but he said it was just from the stress. Nothing permanent, I don't think. I’ve had the usual colds and stuff, but nothing serious. Haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so elevated blood pressure related to stress in the past, but nothing currently managed. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly recently. That’s good information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. No surgeries either. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Just a cast, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's excellent. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that your parents or siblings might have?
PATIENT: Uh… my dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. He was older when it happened. And my mom, she had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself. Smoked a lot, drank a lot. Didn’t really listen to the doctors. That’s… about it, I think. My brother’s healthy as a horse, always been that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues in your father and diabetes in your mother. And your brother is healthy. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it, actually. Always seemed kinda dumb. My ex-wife smoked, though. That was… one of the reasons things didn’t work out.
DOCTOR: I understand. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes. Maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing crazy. Not every weekend, either. Just… when I'm relaxing. It helps me unwind.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption. That’s good to know. Now, about medications – are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. Don’t like feeling… messed with, I guess. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements other than an occasional multivitamin. That’s very straightforward. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky, like I said.
DOCTOR: You do seem pretty healthy. Alright, that completes the basic history questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic look at everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let’s just get it over with. The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could please hop up on the exam table, that would be great. I'll start with checking your blood pressure. I'm just going to wrap this around your arm. Try to relax your arm, and don't talk while I'm taking the reading. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Alright, everything seems generally okay, but the blood pressure is a bit high. I’d like to order a few labs just to get a more complete picture – a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: Labs… uh… I guess so. Will the insurance cover it? I don't want a big bill. And where do I go to get them done? I don't really know this area that well.
DOCTOR: Yes, the life insurance policy should cover these standard labs. I’m confirming that now… okay, yes, it’s covered. You’ll just need to go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital - it's about 10 minutes from here. I'll print out a lab requisition for you with the address and instructions. They're open until 5 PM today. Once you’ve had the labs done, you can either have the results sent directly to my office, or you can bring them back with you. Then we can discuss the results and determine if any further action is needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds… okay. I’ll try to get it done today then. I just… I really don't want any surprises with the bill. So, just to be clear, the insurance definitely covers it, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. As you can see here, these are standard labs covered under the life insurance physical benefit. I’ve confirmed it with the insurance company directly. There is no out-of-pocket cost for these tests as long as you go to a lab within their network – which Suburban General Hospital is. Here it is – “Standard Life Insurance Physical Panel – 100% Coverage.” I understand your concern about the bill, and I want to assure you that everything is covered. But if you do receive a bill for any reason, please call my office immediately and we will sort it out for you. Does that make you feel a little better?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that… that does make me feel better. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it. I guess that's all then? I can go get the labs done?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today. Just take this requisition to Suburban General Hospital, and they'll take care of everything. I’ll be in touch once I receive the results. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Putney. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions at all. Have a good day.
