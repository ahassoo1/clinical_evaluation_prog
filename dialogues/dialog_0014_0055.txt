DOCTOR: Right. Ellan, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Ellan Rannells. And, if you don’t mind me saying, this is a… rather rustic establishment. Not quite what I expected.
DOCTOR: Well, we serve the community here. Resources are… limited. Now, what brings you in today, Ellan?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, my niece suggested I come. She’s… very modern, you see. Thinks this “medical marijuana” is all the rage for… ailments. I’m here to get a… certification, I believe she called it. Though I must admit, I’m not entirely sure why I need permission to use something that, well, people have always used. But she insists it's the proper way now. And I do have a bit of trouble sleeping these days.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana… yes. A growing trend. Though I’m not convinced of all the… benefits. Sleep trouble, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not a debilitating problem, mind you. But enough to disrupt things. I used to be able to fall asleep the moment my head hit the pillow. Now? I toss and turn, thinking about… well, everything. My garden, the state of the world, whether Beatrice is getting enough calcium… you know, important things. It’s just… irritating. And my husband snores. Terribly. Though I won’t ask him to change, naturally. He’s earned it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Important things.” And how long has this been going on, this trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… worsening, gradually, over the past year, I suppose. Perhaps a bit longer. It's hard to pinpoint, you see. I don't keep a detailed log of my… nighttime frustrations. One has a life, Doctor. A very full life. It’s not as if it’s stopped me from tending to my orchids, or supervising the household staff. But it is rather tiresome, constantly waking up feeling less than refreshed.
DOCTOR: Tiresome. Alright. And are you taking anything to help you sleep now?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. No pills, no potions, no… fads. I believe in a good cup of chamomile tea before bed, and a clear conscience. Though, as I said, the snoring… it rather negates the benefits of the tea. I simply… endure. My mother always said a strong constitution is the best medicine. And I do have a strong constitution. Always have. Though, one can’t endure everything, I suppose. That’s what my niece said, anyway. Something about… receptors and… cannabinoids. Honestly, it’s all rather technical.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. And you said your husband snores… does he have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. He tends to… puff a bit when he’s gardening. And he’s always complaining about his knees. Old rugby injury, you see. He refuses to see a doctor, of course. Says doctors only poke and prod. A very stubborn man, my Reginald. And he does have a rather… robust appetite. Though, I cook very well, so I can hardly blame him. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I do hope we're getting somewhere. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant. Puffiness and knee complaints… alright. Let's move on to you. Any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, thankfully. My ankles swell a bit after a long day in the garden, but a good elevation usually does the trick. And I had a rather nasty bout of shingles a few years back, but that cleared up beautifully. Though the nerve pain occasionally flares up, particularly in damp weather. It’s… unpleasant, but manageable. Really, Doctor, I'm a very healthy woman for my age. I simply want a bit of assistance getting a decent night's sleep, and my niece seems convinced this… marijuana is the answer. Though I still don’t understand why I need a certificate. Is it some sort of… tax thing?
DOCTOR: A certificate is… a legal requirement. Now, before we discuss any… potential treatments, I need to do a quick examination. Just to be thorough, you understand. Blood pressure, pulse… the usual. And perhaps listen to your lungs. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. That does seem reasonable. Very well. Though, I must warn you, my blood pressure tends to rise when I’m subjected to unnecessary questioning. And please be gentle with the lungs. I do have a delicate constitution, you know. I suppose it’s better to be thorough, though. Lead the way, Doctor. Though I do hope your examination room is adequately ventilated. It’s terribly stuffy in here.
DOCTOR: Right. This way. And it is ventilated. Just… standard. Please, have a seat on the exam table. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must I really? I’ve just had a pedicure, you know. And these are rather new orthopedic shoes. Reginald insisted. Said my arches were collapsing. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Very well, Doctor. But please be careful. And do tell me what exactly you're looking for. I do prefer to be informed. It’s my body, after all.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, as expected. Lungs are clear, but a bit of… diminished breath sounds. Pulse is regular. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please, relax your legs. Reflexes are… diminished. Not alarming, but we'll make a note of it. And… ankles are slightly swollen, as you mentioned. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over the counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was rather… startling. And, as I said before, Doctor, I take no medications. Not a single pill, potion, or… remedy. Chamomile tea, occasionally. And a very healthy diet, of course. Reginald does try to get me to take something for my knees, but I refuse. I simply rub them with a bit of menthol rub. And I have a very strict regimen of gardening, which keeps everything… mobile. Honestly, Doctor, I’m remarkably healthy for my age. Are you suggesting something is wrong with me? Because if so, I’d like to know precisely what it is. And please, no more hammering. It’s terribly undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. I'm not suggesting anything is wrong with you, Mrs. Rannells, but your diminished reflexes and slightly elevated blood pressure do warrant some… further investigation. And the diminished breath sounds are a little concerning. Now, before we talk about this "certification", I need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. It's standard procedure. Just to rule out anything… serious.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Blood work? Good heavens, Doctor, are you certain that's necessary? I came here for a certificate, not a complete medical overhaul! I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. A bit of trouble sleeping, a bit of swelling, and a bit of nerve pain… it’s hardly a cause for alarm. Perhaps this “certification” is more trouble than it’s worth. Are you absolutely certain you can’t simply… sign the form? My niece said it was a fairly straightforward process. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… it’s quite upsetting. I came here hoping for a simple solution, not a battery of tests.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Rannells, with all due respect, I am a physician. My responsibility is to ensure your health and safety. A certificate without a proper evaluation would be… unethical. I cannot simply “sign the form” based on your assurances. The tests will help me determine if this sleep issue is simply due to stress, or if there's an underlying medical condition. Look, I'm not trying to upset you. But I need to rule out things like… pneumonia, heart failure, or even a neurological issue. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Pneumonia? Heart failure? Neurological issue? Doctor, with all due respect, you are being utterly ridiculous! I’ve lived a full and active life, I tend to a magnificent garden, I supervise a household staff, and I have a perfectly sound constitution! My mother always said a good night's sleep and a clear conscience are the best medicine, and I have both! This is simply a matter of… easing a bit of nighttime discomfort. My niece assures me this… marijuana is perfectly safe, and a great many people are using it. Honestly, I feel as if you're deliberately trying to make this more complicated than it needs to be. Very well, Doctor. Order your tests. But I must warn you, if anything… alarming… turns up, I will hold you personally responsible for all the unnecessary stress and anxiety. And I expect a full explanation of everything. In layman's terms, of course. I’m not a medical professional, you see. I simply want a certificate and a good night's sleep. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: .
