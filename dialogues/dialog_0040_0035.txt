DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Sucich, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Mirriam Sucich. Though most folks just call me Mirriam. It's nice to meet you, Dr… Osga, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Osga is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so if we could just get straight to it… What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, of course. Sorry to take up your time. It's these hiccups, you see. They started a couple of days ago, and they just… won’t stop. It’s rather embarrassing, actually, especially when I’m visiting with friends. They just come and go, all on their own.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. How long exactly has it been a couple of days?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started Tuesday afternoon, I believe. So, two full days and… most of today. It’s not constant, mind you. It’s more like little bursts throughout the day. Maybe ten or twelve times an hour, if that makes sense? It's hard to keep track, really, when you're being hiccuped!
DOCTOR: And have you tried anything to… resolve them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything I could think of, really. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my grandson showed me one where you swallow a teaspoon of sugar, but that just made me sticky! Nothing seems to work, not even for a little bit. It's quite perplexing. I haven’t had hiccups this bad since I was a little girl, and even then, they didn't last this long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I've noticed, really. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no dizziness… just the hiccups. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping alright, everything seems… regular, you know? Except for the hiccups, of course! It’s just… annoying, more than anything. Though it is tiring, trying to hold it together when they strike.
DOCTOR: Any difficulty breathing, or pain in your chest with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that at all! It doesn’t hurt to breathe, and I’m not short of breath. It’s just a sudden hic! and then it’s gone. Like that, you see? Just a little jolt. Nothing serious, I’m sure. But it's unsettling when it happens repeatedly, and I just want it to stop!
DOCTOR: You said this started Tuesday… are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh yes, let me think. Just the usual. I take a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, and a Vitamin D supplement, as the doctor told me I was a bit low last year. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. But I haven’t taken any Ibuprofen in… oh, maybe a week or so. Nothing new, I assure you. Same as always.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I used to think I was allergic to mangoes when I was a child, but it turned out I just didn’t like the taste! I've eaten everything, tried everything, and never had a reaction. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. Just a healthy appetite, really. Except when the hiccups come, of course!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s have a listen to your chest, just to be sure. And I’ll check your pulse. It’s just routine, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I understand completely. Routine is good! Please, go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s just a bit… embarrassing when it happens while you’re listening.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Pulse is regular, a little fast, but that could be anxiety. Blood pressure is 130/80. Anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little bit… unsettled lately. Just a general feeling of being… off. Nothing specific, mind you, but I’ve been having trouble sleeping properly. Not because of the hiccups, necessarily, but just… restless. And I haven’t been eating as much as I usually do. I thought it was just getting old, to be honest, but maybe it’s all connected?
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said the hiccups started Tuesday… has anything unusual happened in the days leading up to that?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Tuesday… Well, my grandson, David, came to visit last weekend. We had a lovely time, went to the market, made a big Sunday roast… oh, and he brought his new girlfriend, Sarah. She's a lovely girl, very quiet, but we were all chatting and laughing a lot. I suppose it was a bit more excitement than I've had in a while. Could that have something to do with it? I hadn't thought of that. Perhaps I was just a bit overstimulated.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's likely just a benign case of hiccups. Given your age and otherwise stable health, I'm not overly concerned. I’ll prescribe you some Baclofen, it’s a muscle relaxant. It may help calm things down. Take one tablet three times a day with meals. If they don’t improve within a week, come back and we’ll consider further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… wonderful, Doctor. Baclofen, you say? Is it… a strong medication? I don’t want anything that will make me drowsy, you know. I still like to be able to enjoy my gardening! But if you think it will help… I trust your judgment. A week, you say? Alright. I’ll come back if they haven’t improved. Thank you so much, Doctor Osga.
DOCTOR: It's a low dose, and shouldn't affect you too much. But if you do feel drowsy, stop taking it and call the office. And try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that's reassuring, thank you. Relax, you say? Easier said than done when you’re hiccuping! But I'll certainly try. I do enjoy a good cup of tea and a quiet afternoon in the garden. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: Just dizziness or nausea. If you experience either, stop taking the medication. Otherwise, try not to worry about it. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that covers everything. Just the dizziness or nausea to watch out for. Alright, I’ll be sure to keep an eye out. You’ve been very kind, Doctor Osga. Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old woman and her hiccups! I appreciate it very much. I’ll let you get back to your busy schedule now.
DOCTOR: Right. See you then. .
