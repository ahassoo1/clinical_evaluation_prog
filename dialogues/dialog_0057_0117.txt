DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good mornin'. Just… a cough. Been coughin' a bit. And… there was some blood. Not a lot, but… yeah. Blood when I coughed. It’s been a few days now, I think. Hard to remember exactly when it started. I mostly just want it to stop, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Reyno. Coughing up blood is concerning, and we want to figure out what’s going on. A few days… okay. Can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: More… how to say… it's a deep cough. Like somethin' stuck. And it happens mostly in the mornin', I guess. When I first wake up. Sometimes during the day, but not as much. I smoke, if that… if that has somethin' to do with it. Been smokin' a long time. Don't know how much it helps, but… it’s somethin' I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep cough that’s worse in the morning, and you mentioned you smoke. Thank you for letting me know, that’s very important information. How much do you typically smoke, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… a pack a day, maybe a little more. Been a long time since I counted, to be honest. Always have a cigarette with my coffee, and then… throughout the day. Not as much now as I used to, but… still a good bit. I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this cough been gradually getting worse, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Sudden, I think. Or… at least, I don’t remember it gettin’ worse slowly. Just… one day it was there, and then… the blood. That’s why I came in. Didn't want to ignore it, you know? Things like that can get… bad.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and you’re right to get it checked out. Okay, let’s talk about the blood. How much blood are we talking about?
PATIENT: Not a lot. Like… streaks in the mucus. Not enough to fill a tissue, if that makes sense. More like… red spots. A few times it was a little more, but not… a whole lot. Enough to worry me, but… not like I was coughin' up… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks or spots of blood in your mucus. And is the mucus itself any particular color – white, yellow, green, or something else?
PATIENT: Mostly… kinda yellowish, I think. Sometimes clear. When there’s blood, it’s… reddish-yellow, I guess. Hard to explain. It just looks… dirty, mostly. Not normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellowish mucus sometimes with streaks of blood. Have you had any other symptoms along with the cough – fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Night sweats… maybe a little. Hard to say. I get warm at night sometimes, but I live in the desert. It gets hot. Fever… no, I don’t think so. No chills, no chest pain. Shortness of breath… not really. I get tired easy, but I’m… older. That’s probably just age. I haven’t lost weight, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or chest pain. Some night sweats, potentially related to the climate, and fatigue, which you attribute to age. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… nothin’ major. I have Medicare, so somethin’s probably written down somewhere. I get checked up now and then. Old age comes with things, you know? Can’t remember exactly what they told me, though. Always forget. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? They gave me pills for it.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible high blood pressure managed with medication. We can look through your records here to confirm. Do you recall what medications you are currently taking for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Small white pills. I take ‘em every mornin’. That’s all I remember. Little bottle, little pills. Not sure of the name. I just… take ‘em. My daughter usually fills the bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay, small white pills every morning for blood pressure. We'll definitely confirm the exact name and dosage in your records. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell outta a tree. But nothin’ since then. No surgeries, no hospital stays… that I remember. Maybe somethin’ when I was real young, but… it's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, but no recent surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, lung cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… my mother, she had… somethin’ with her lungs. Always coughin’. But I don’t remember exactly what it was. And my father, he had… heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago. We didn’t talk about things like that much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of lung problems in your mother and heart problems in your father. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy. I eat anything. I can't say I know of any. I get a bit itchy sometimes when I get dust on me but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you currently smoke or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: I told you, I smoke. A pack a day, mostly. Been doin’ it a long time. I don't do nothin' else. Just cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. Okay, that gives me a good start. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll also check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you could sit up here for me, that would be great. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially on the left side. Your heart sounds are a bit muffled, but otherwise regular. I also notice you have a bit of a barrel chest, which can be common with a long smoking history. Is it alright if I take your temperature and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Alright. Temperature and… whatever. Just… hurry, please. Wheezin'? Is that bad? I don't feel sick, just tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me quickly check your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is normal at 98.6°F. Your blood pressure is elevated at 145/90. The wheezing indicates some narrowing of your airways, which can make it harder to breathe, and it's often associated with smoking. The elevated blood pressure is also a concern. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, I’m concerned about the possibility of COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – given your smoking history and the wheezing I'm hearing. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Pulmonary… what now? Look, I just want somethin' for the cough. Is there a pill or somethin'? I don't need tests. I'm an old man. Tests take time.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to have tests, Mr. Reyno. However, those tests are important to determine the cause of your cough and make sure we’re treating you appropriately. We can't just guess. Knowing whether it’s COPD or something else will help us choose the best treatment and prevent things from getting worse. Right now, I can prescribe you a cough suppressant to help with the symptoms, but that won't address the underlying problem. The X-ray will help rule out any other issues, like pneumonia or lung cancer, and the pulmonary function test will give us information about how well your lungs are functioning. Would you be willing to consider the tests?
PATIENT: …Lung cancer? Is that what you’re thinkin'? Oh, alright. Fine. Do the tests. But don’t keep me here all day. I got things to do, remember? Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. And I’ll do my best to make this as quick and efficient as possible. I’m not necessarily thinking lung cancer, but it's important to rule it out. The tests will help us get a clear picture of what’s going on. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and we can schedule the pulmonary function test for tomorrow morning. The nurse will come in shortly to get you set up for the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help relieve your symptoms. It’s important to continue taking any medications you’re already taking for your blood pressure. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Nurse? Tomorrow? This is takin’ too long. Okay. Fine. Just… tell me when. And what kinda medicine is it? Anything bad I gotta watch out for? I forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about potential side effects, Mr. Reyno, and I’ll make sure to explain everything clearly. The cough suppressant is called Tessalon Perles. It helps to reduce the cough reflex. Some people experience mild side effects like dizziness or drowsiness, so it’s important not to drive or operate machinery while taking it. If you experience any severe side effects like difficulty breathing or an allergic reaction, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your doctor. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the X-ray process and schedule your pulmonary function test for tomorrow morning. She'll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the test. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: …No. Just get it over with. I'm tired of talkin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. I understand. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Please just let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
