DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, you see. Just wanting to keep an eye on things, if you will. I am quite particular about preventative care, and my wife, bless her heart, encourages it as well.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Mombrun. Preventative care is incredibly important, and it sounds like you have a wonderful support system in your wife. A general wellness check and lab panel is a great idea. Let me just quickly review your information here… I see you're 74 years old, and your insurance is private. Do you have any particular concerns you'd like to discuss today, or any recent changes in your health that I should be aware of before we get started with the exam?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that information is correct. And thank you for confirming. No, nothing major has changed, thankfully. I have my usual aches and pains, you know, from the construction work I still do—though not as much as before, I assure you. Mostly just wanting a full picture of how things are functioning. I find it reassuring to have these numbers, to have a baseline, so to speak. And I am very particular about my hydration, I drink plenty of water, even in this heat.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the hydration, Mr. Mombrun. Staying well-hydrated is key, especially with this summer heat. And it’s perfectly normal to have some aches and pains with physical work—even reduced work. To get a full picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing chronic, thankfully. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. My blood pressure has been monitored for years – my wife is a retired nurse, you see, and she’s very diligent – and it’s always been within a normal range. I did have a bout of pneumonia some years ago, perhaps fifteen years now, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, just the usual colds and flu from time to time, nothing serious. I’ve always been a robust fellow, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A robust constitution is a great thing, and having a nurse in the family is a definite advantage! Fifteen years ago for the pneumonia is good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, as a young man, I had my appendix removed. A rather standard procedure, I believe, nearly fifty years ago now. And… ah, yes. I had a small tear in my meniscus repaired in my left knee, about twenty years ago. A football injury from my youth, resurfaced later in life. Aside from those two, no, nothing else. Both recoveries were uncomplicated, thankfully. I was quite active even during the healing process, much to the chagrin of the doctors, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. Appendectomy and meniscus repair, both some time ago. It sounds like you’ve had a fairly active life despite those little setbacks. Now, thinking about your family… Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, that is a fair question, Doctor. My father, bless his soul, suffered from heart disease later in life. He was a hardworking man, but didn’t always take care of himself as he should have. My mother, she lived to be quite old, but did develop type 2 diabetes in her eighties. And… my younger brother, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years ago, but thankfully, it was caught early and he’s doing quite well after treatment. Aside from those instances, nothing particularly prevalent, if that makes sense. I've always believed in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, hoping to mitigate any potential inherited risks, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Mombrun. Family history of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and prostate cancer. And it’s excellent that you’re proactive about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Now, just a few questions about your current habits. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never have, never will. My wife would have my hide if I even considered it! I find it a rather unpleasant habit, and I've always believed in taking care of my lungs, especially considering the construction work I've done over the years. Dust and debris are enough of a concern, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Very moderate, Doctor, very moderate. Perhaps a glass of red wine with dinner on occasion, perhaps twice a week, but no more than that. I enjoy a good meal and a glass of wine, but I believe in moderation in all things. And my wife ensures I don’t overindulge, of course. She’s quite sensible in that regard.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable, Mr. Mombrun. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin daily, Doctor, as a preventative measure, recommended by my primary care physician a few years ago. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but only as needed, very infrequently. And I do take a daily multivitamin, nothing fancy, just to supplement my diet. Aside from those, no, nothing else. I prefer to rely on a healthy diet and exercise whenever possible. I've always been cautious about putting unnecessary things into my system, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Mombrun. Aspirin, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. We'll just check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Proceed as you see fit. I trust your expertise. And please, do not hesitate to tell me if you see anything concerning. I’d rather know everything, even if it’s not pleasant. Better to be informed, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will certainly keep you informed. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound good, clear breath sounds, regular rhythm. Ears look clear, throat is a little red but nothing concerning at the moment. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. So, overall, everything seems within normal limits, Mr. Mombrun. But the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor, and I’d like to order some blood work to get a more complete picture. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds quite sensible. I appreciate your thoroughness. A little elevated blood pressure, you say? I do occasionally get a bit stressed with the construction projects, perhaps that is contributing. I am glad you are being proactive about the blood work. I trust your judgement entirely. Whatever you deem necessary, I am happy to comply. And please, do not hesitate to explain the results to me in detail. I prefer to understand everything, as I mentioned before.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. I will explain everything in detail. Stress can certainly contribute to elevated blood pressure, so we’ll keep that in mind. The blood work I'd like to order includes a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. This will give us a good baseline and help us identify any potential issues. It also includes a PSA test given your family history. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very acceptable indeed. A comprehensive panel, you say? Excellent. And you are quite thoughtful to include the PSA test, given my brother’s history. I appreciate your attention to detail. Whenever you are ready, I can provide the necessary sample. Whatever is most convenient for you and the lab. I trust your instructions entirely.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Mombrun. I appreciate your cooperation. Alright, we’ll just need a urine sample and some blood drawn. The nurse will be in shortly to collect those for you. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your healthy lifestyle and managing any stress you might be experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I am confident in your care and your recommendations. I am happy to follow your instructions. And I thank you for your time and your attention to detail. If anything arises, I will, of course, contact the office. Otherwise, I eagerly await the results and our follow-up appointment. Thank you once again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything does come up. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
