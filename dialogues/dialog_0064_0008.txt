DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. So, to start us off, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, hello. It’s… my ear, I think. Feels full. Like something’s… blocked. Honestly, it’s been a bit fuzzy lately, remembering things, so I can't say when exactly it started. Just… full. And a little… plugged, I guess. I just want to get it sorted, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's alright, don't worry about the fuzziness – that happens. We’ll take our time. A feeling of fullness in the ear, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Fullness. Like when you're flying in a plane, maybe? But… not quite as bad. Just… present. It’s mostly in the right ear, I think. Or maybe both? It’s… difficult to say, really. Honestly, I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right, fullness in both ears, potentially, but more noticeable on the right. And it’s been going on for… a while now. Hmm. Any pain with that, Mr. Guerrerolopez?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… annoying, you know? A sort of… pressure. And it makes it hard to hear sometimes, especially… quiet sounds. I don’t really watch television much, so it hasn’t bothered me too much. But I do like… the birds. And it’s harder to hear them now. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It’s good you're noticing those subtle changes. So, no pain, just fullness and difficulty hearing quieter sounds, especially birdsong. Any dizziness or ringing in your ears accompanying that?
PATIENT: Ringing… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Dizziness… well, sometimes I feel a little unsteady, but I put that down to… getting older, mostly. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. Honestly, I've been falling over a bit more lately, but I don't know if that’s related to my ear. Is that a normal question, Doctor? Sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's important to mention everything, even if you're unsure if it's related. The unsteadiness is good to know. So, just to clarify, you’ve noticed some falls or a feeling of being unsteady recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A few little stumbles, mostly. Nothing major, thankfully. I haven't actually fallen properly, just… lost my balance a couple of times. It’s probably just age, like I said. And I take medication, I think… for… well, something. The doctor back home… I can't quite recall what it was for. My wife used to manage all that. It's been a bit difficult since… you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It’s alright, we can sort through all of this. We'll get to the bottom of your medications, don’t worry. Perhaps we can check your records?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be wonderful. If you can find anything, that would be a great help. Honestly, my memory… it’s just not what it used to be. I don't even remember the name of the last doctor I saw, it's awful. Can we just look at my ear, then? Maybe that will tell you something. I'd rather not talk about it anymore, if that’s alright. It’s all a bit… unsettling, remembering things vaguely.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. We can definitely take a look at your ears. That’s a good place to start. Let me just pull up your records first – one moment. Okay, I see here you were last seen by Dr. van Dijk on July 15th. And it looks like you are currently prescribed Lisinopril 10mg daily for high blood pressure. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… high blood pressure… Yes, that… that rings a bell. My wife always said something about my blood pressure. Yes, that must be it. Lisinopril. Goodness, you’re very thorough, Doctor. Yes, I think that’s correct. Okay. Can we look at my ear now? I'm ready when you are. It's a bit embarrassing, all this forgetting, but... you're very patient.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Mr. Guerrerolopez. We all have moments. Alright, let’s take a look. Okay, I’m looking at your ears now. The ear canals themselves look clear. Your eardrums appear a little… dull, on both sides. Not inflamed, just not as shiny as they should be. That could be contributing to the fullness and difficulty hearing. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. We should do a tympanometry test and an audiogram to assess your hearing and middle ear function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get it sorted, you know? Tympanometry… audiogram… I don’t even know what those are, but if you think they'll help… yes. Can we get them done quickly, please? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. It’s not very important, but… well, you understand. Is it a long process?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Tympanometry assesses how well your middle ear is functioning, and the audiogram measures your hearing sensitivity at different frequencies. It shouldn't take too long - maybe 20-30 minutes for both tests. Our audiologist, Sarah, is just down the hall. I'll have her get you set up right away. We'll be able to get the results fairly quickly. Would you be able to walk down to the audiology department, or would you like me to have a nurse escort you?
PATIENT: I think I can manage, thank you. I'm not completely helpless, you know. Just… forgetful. Yes, I can walk down there myself. Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Hopefully, they’ll tell me what’s wrong, and I can get it fixed quickly. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Should I avoid anything?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special at all, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Just try to be as relaxed as possible during the tests. The audiologist will explain everything to you before they start. I'll let Sarah know to expect you. She’s very good at explaining things, and she’ll be able to answer any questions you have. Do you know where the audiology department is, or would you like me to point you in the right direction?
PATIENT: I think I can find it, thank you. Down the hall, you said? Yes, I believe so. Honestly, I should probably be taking notes, but… well, you know. I'll just… wander down the hall. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I hope the tests don't take too long. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask Sarah if you have any trouble. We’ll get this figured out. .
