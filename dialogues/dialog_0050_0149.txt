DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Paraskevopoulos, you say? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don’t rightly remember why I’m here. My daughter, Bernice, made the appointment, you see. She’s a good girl, worries too much. Something about not wanting me to… do something the doctors want? Honestly, it all sounds like a fuss to me. I feel fine, mostly. Just a bit of ache in my feet, like always.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s not uncommon for patients to have appointments scheduled for them by family members. While I appreciate you feeling well, Ms. Gunasekara, it would be helpful to understand the reason for the appointment even if your daughter initiated it. Do you recall anything she mentioned specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, Bernice… always flapping about. Let me think… She said something about… a procedure? And… not wanting me to have it. Said I was too old for… poking and prodding, was that it? She gets very dramatic. It was about my feet, definitely. Something about… keeping them healthy? Honestly, I've had feet my whole life, they seem alright to me. A little bunion, maybe. But who doesn’t have a bunion?
DOCTOR: I’m accessing your electronic health record now. Ah, yes. It appears your daughter scheduled this appointment due to concern about a podiatric consult recommended by your previous physician regarding painful bunions and a possible hammertoe on your left foot, and a recommendation for possible surgical intervention. Were you aware of these findings?
PATIENT: Surgical intervention? Goodness gracious, no! That girl never said anything about surgery. Just “keeping an eye on things.” Surgery at my age? Don't be ridiculous. I've lived a good long life without needing knives stuck in me, and I certainly don’t intend to start now. My previous physician… Dr. something… was always trying to sell me something. New shoes, orthotics, now surgery? Honestly, doctors these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about surgical options, particularly at any age. Before dismissing it entirely, let's examine your feet to get a clearer picture of the situation. Then we can discuss non-surgical options if that’s your preference. Would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A quick exam? Hmmph. I suppose. But don’t go poking and prodding too much. And I want to know everything you're doing before you do it. I don’t like surprises. Honestly, I bet it's nothing. I've walked miles in my life, you know. And these shoes are perfectly comfortable, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I will explain each step before I perform it. First, I'm simply going to visually inspect your feet, looking for areas of swelling, redness, or deformity. I note some mild edema in both lower extremities, and a moderate bunion on the first metatarsophalangeal joint of your left foot. There is also a noticeable hammertoe deformity on your second toe, left foot. Palpation reveals some tenderness at the base of the second toe. Do you experience pain with walking or wearing shoes?
PATIENT: Oh! That's a bit tender, yes. Pain…well, it's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache. Mostly when I wear my good shoes, the ones for church. These comfortable ones, I hardly notice it. I can walk alright, but… it does bother me sometimes. Especially if I’m on my feet for a long time. Bernice keeps saying I shouldn't walk as much, but… a body needs moving, don't you think?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Gunasekara; regular movement is important. I'm assessing the range of motion in your toes. There is some stiffness in the second toe joint, and limited dorsiflexion. I also note some areas of hyperkeratosis – thickened skin – on the ball of your foot, likely due to pressure. Given these findings, it’s clear the bunion and hammertoe are contributing to your discomfort, and the hyperkeratosis is likely a secondary issue. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or arthritis, that could be contributing to these issues?
PATIENT: Arthritis… well, my mother had something in her hands. All the joints. It was awful. I've never been officially diagnosed with it, though. And diabetes? Oh, no, not diabetes. I eat a good, healthy diet, mostly. Bernice worries too much about my sugar intake, always bringing me those… sugar-free things. I don't like them. As for other conditions… I have a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, and my memory isn't what it used to be. But who doesn’t forget things at my age?
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of arthritis is relevant. And while occasional memory lapses are common with age, we should document any significant cognitive concerns. Let's briefly review your current medications, if any. Are you taking anything regularly, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. Dr. Ramirez gave it to me, years ago. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take some of that ibuprofen. The pink pills. Bernice brings them for me. I don't really keep track of it, honestly. It's all a bit of a blur. She manages most of it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a medication for hypertension and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Thank you for that information. Now, Ms. Gunasekara, given your examination findings – the bunion, hammertoe, limited range of motion, hyperkeratosis – and your history, we have a clearer picture of the source of your discomfort. The bunion and hammertoe are likely causing the pain and contributing to the hyperkeratosis. While surgical intervention is an option, it’s not the only one. We can explore conservative management, including wider shoes, orthotics, padding, and possibly physical therapy. Would you be interested in trying these options first?
PATIENT: Wider shoes and… padding? Orthotics? That sounds… complicated. Honestly, I just want my feet to feel better. I don’t want any fuss, Doctor. No surgeries, no fancy equipment, no… anything that requires a lot of effort. Can you just… give me something to make it stop hurting? A cream, maybe? Something simple? I really just want to be able to wear my comfortable shoes without aching.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a simple solution, Ms. Gunasekara. While a cream might provide some temporary relief from the hyperkeratosis and discomfort, it won’t address the underlying structural issues of the bunion and hammertoe. However, we can try a topical cream to reduce the pressure and irritation. I can prescribe a salicylic acid-based cream to help soften the thickened skin. Additionally, I recommend wearing wider shoes with good cushioning, and avoiding prolonged standing or walking as much as possible. We will also explore some basic foot exercises that may help improve flexibility. It’s important to understand that these measures may only provide limited relief, and surgical intervention remains an option if these conservative approaches are unsuccessful. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Wider shoes, cream, and a little exercise… that sounds… manageable. As long as it’s not too strenuous. I don’t do well with bending and stretching anymore. And I certainly don’t want any surgery. So, cream and shoes it is, then. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. My feet have seen better days. And if it doesn’t work… well, I suppose I’ll just have to live with the ache.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m prescribing a topical salicylic acid cream. Apply it to the affected areas of both feet twice daily after washing and drying them thoroughly. I'm also providing a handout with some simple foot exercises you can try. Remember, start slowly and listen to your body. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. I would like to see you back in six weeks to assess your progress. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they worsen, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a podiatrist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Six weeks, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose that sounds alright. As long as I don't have to do too much bending. I suppose my only question is… will this cream stain my shoes? I have a lovely pair of church shoes I wouldn’t want to ruin. That Bernice would have a fit.
DOCTOR: That is a valid concern, Ms. Gunasekara. The cream can potentially stain light-colored materials, so it's best to avoid applying it immediately before wearing those shoes. Allow it to fully absorb into the skin before putting on your footwear, and if possible, wear socks to create a barrier. If staining does occur, there are shoe cleaning products available that may help. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just the staining, and… not too much bending. Bernice would have a fit if I pulled a muscle. You’ve been very patient with an old lady, Doctor. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I need to go find my daughter. She’s probably worrying about me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Gunasekara. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. I wish you a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks. .
