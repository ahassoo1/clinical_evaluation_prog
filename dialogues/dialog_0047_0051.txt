DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come. Something about... needing to know what kind of blood I have? It’s a bit silly, really. I can’t quite recall why it’s important, but she was very insistent.
DOCTOR: "Blood type," you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Blood type. It’s just... things aren't what they used to be, you know? My memory… it plays tricks on me. Is it important to know? I haven't needed to think about that in… well, a very long time. Perhaps it’s for a new medicine? I've been taking a few lately, for my… aches and pains.
DOCTOR: It can be important, yes. Primarily for blood transfusions, should you ever need one. And sometimes it is helpful to know when starting certain medications, though not always. Your daughter is right to be proactive. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any major health conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant… that’s a big word. Let me think. Well, old age, of course! No, seriously… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, a long time ago. They said it was… something about the rhythm? I had a little operation, but that was years and years ago. And I get a bit breathless sometimes, but that’s just… getting old, I suppose. As for anything else… I honestly couldn't say. My mind is a bit fuzzy on all that. Would you have records of things from before? I used to go to a doctor in… Barcelona, I think. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see if we can access anything from your previous care. It can sometimes be difficult with records from overseas. You mentioned a heart condition – do you remember roughly when you had that operation?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… that’s the tricky part. It feels like… well, a lifetime ago. Perhaps… the early 1980s? Or maybe the late 70s? It was definitely before my husband, Ricardo, got sick. He… he passed away in '92. So, sometime before that, certainly. It wasn't a very big operation, as I recall. Just a little… tinkering. They said it would help with the palpitations. I used to get very flustered easily, you see. Always a bit of a worrier, that was me.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’ll note that as a cardiac procedure sometime in the 70s or early 80s. And do you currently have any other medical conditions you're aware of, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My knees, definitely. They ache something awful, especially in the damp weather. And my hands… they get a bit stiff sometimes, makes it hard to do my knitting. I used to be a very fast knitter, you know. Made sweaters for all the grandchildren. And… oh! I get terribly tired. Just… bone-deep tired. It’s not like being sleepy, it’s just… lacking energy. Does that count? I don't know if that's a condition, per se. It’s just… how I feel these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee pain, hand stiffness, and fatigue. And are you currently taking any medications for these issues, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite a few, I think. Let me see if I can remember… there’s the little blue one, for my blood pressure, I believe. And a white one, for the aches. My daughter helps me organize them, you see. She puts them in little containers, labeled with the days of the week. I think there's something for my… digestion, too? And sometimes, when my knees are particularly bad, I take something extra. But I couldn't tell you what it is, dear. It all looks the same to me! I'm afraid I'm not very good with names, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like we need to get a complete list of your current medications. Do you have any of the bottles with you today, or a list your daughter prepared?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't, I'm afraid. I usually leave them at home, you see. My daughter keeps them all neatly organized in the kitchen. She'd have a list, certainly. She’s very good with these things. Perhaps you could call her? Her name is Sofia. I can give you her number, if you'd like. She lives nearby, so it wouldn't be any trouble at all. It’s on a little card here somewhere…
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, yes. Please.
PATIENT: Here you are, dear. It’s a bit worn, I'm afraid. She changes her number sometimes, but this should be the current one. It says… 555-123-4567. Please tell her I said hello, and that you’re just trying to figure out what medicines I’m taking. She worries about me, you see. You’re very kind to go to all this trouble.
DOCTOR: We’ll just see if she answers. While we wait, let's talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I've never had a terribly bad reaction to anything. I used to eat shellfish all the time, when I lived by the sea. And I eat peanuts, and… well, just about everything, really. Perhaps I was a bit sensitive to some sort of pollen, when I was younger, but it was nothing serious. Just a bit of a sniffle, you know? Though, now that I think about it… I get a bit of a rash sometimes, on my arms, if I use certain soaps. But it’s not a terrible rash, just a little itchy. I suppose that’s not a proper allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Hello?
PATIENT: Oh, that must be her! That’s Sofia! Yes, that’s my daughter. Tell her it’s Doctor Press calling. She’s just trying to find out what medicines I’m taking. I’m here at the clinic, you see. She’s very organized, so she’ll know exactly what I have. It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your daughter was very helpful. She provided a list of your medications. It seems you’re taking lisinopril for blood pressure, naproxen for aches and pains, omeprazole for indigestion, and occasional acetaminophen for breakthrough pain. Do any of those medications cause you any side effects?
PATIENT: Oh, good! That's a relief. Sofia is a treasure. Let me think... the little blue one, the lisinopril, sometimes makes me feel a bit dizzy when I stand up too quickly. And the white one, naproxen, I think, sometimes upsets my stomach. Just a little bit, though. Nothing terrible. And I think… yes, the other one, the omeprazole, sometimes gives me a bit of a headache. But it's nothing I can't manage, dear. I’m a bit of a stoic, you see. I don’t complain much. Now, about this blood type... why is it so important again?
DOCTOR: As I mentioned earlier, it’s primarily important in case you ever need a blood transfusion. It's also helpful to know when determining the risk of certain complications, and can be relevant when starting new medications, though that's less common. Given your age and the medications you’re currently taking, it’s prudent to have a baseline blood type on file. We will do a quick blood draw. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood draw… yes, that sounds alright. I’ve had those before, haven’t I? It’s just a little prick, isn’t it? No trouble at all. Though, I do get a bit nervous around needles, if I’m honest. Perhaps you could be quick about it? And… is it painful? I don’t like pain, you see. Though, I suppose it’s for my own good. So, this will tell you what kind of blood I have? It all sounds very scientific!
DOCTOR: It is very quick, I assure you. And minimal discomfort. It’s just a small prick, as you said. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and we’ll have the results back within a few days. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I don’t think so. That’s all I came for, isn’t it? This blood type business. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. My mind isn’t what it used to be, as I’ve said, so I do appreciate you taking the time to explain things. I’m just glad to get it sorted out. And… thank you again for being so understanding. Now, just let me know when the nurse is ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Nini. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. It was my pleasure. She’ll be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
