DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Consultation… right. Well, it’s just… the paperwork said I needed some lab work done. That's all, really. Just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to proceed directly with the lab work. However, as a matter of protocol – and frankly, good medical practice – I do need to ask a few questions before ordering any tests. It ensures we’re conducting the most appropriate investigations. It’s not simply a matter of… “getting it over with,” Mr. Croonquist. It’s about your health. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you were referred for these labs?
PATIENT: Referred? Oh dear… honestly, I can’t rightly recall. Something about… the plant, I think? I used to work at the power plant, you see. Big place. Lots of… machinery. And forms. Probably a form. That’s how these things happen, isn’t it? Forms. I just… I get a lot of paperwork sent to the house, and I usually just sign it and send it back. Medicare, you know. They need things filled out. Do you need a name? The plant, I mean. It was… uh… near the river. Big smokestacks.
DOCTOR: Right. A form from the power plant. I see. And you’re unsure why this form initiated lab work?
PATIENT: Unsure is… a good word. Vague, perhaps, is better. It was a while ago now. Routine check-up, maybe? They had us do those sometimes. Or… something about my blood pressure. It gets a bit high when I’m stressed, which is… often, these days. All the forms. I really can’t say for certain. I just want to know what needs doing, Doctor. Can’t we just get on with it? Is it a simple blood draw?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I appreciate your… impatience. However, a "simple blood draw" could be for a multitude of reasons. To avoid unnecessary testing – and frankly, to ensure I'm ordering the correct tests – I need a more detailed history. Let’s start with your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, my knees ache. They’ve been aching for years. Old age, I suppose. And my back. It goes out sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. Does that count? I don't think I have anything serious. Never been hospitalized, if that's what you’re asking. Just… aches and pains. A bit of trouble sleeping, too. But who doesn't? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a fairly simple man. I just want to make sure everything’s still… working.
DOCTOR: Alright. Aches and pains, difficulty sleeping. Have you been diagnosed with arthritis, or any other condition affecting your joints?
PATIENT: Arthritis… no, I don’t think so. Never been told I have arthritis. The doctor at the plant – Dr. Hemlock, I think his name was – he just gave me some pills for the pain. Said it was probably just wear and tear. I took the pills for a while, but they didn't do much good, so I stopped. I just try to keep moving, you know? Staying active is important. Though it’s hard when your knees are complaining. Honestly, I can’t recall him saying the word ‘arthritis’. Just… pain. Lots of pain.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… now that’s a tough one. Didn’t see much of my family, to be honest. My brother… he lived out west somewhere. California, maybe? He wasn't a very healthy man, if I recall. Always coughing. But that was a long time ago. My parents… they're both gone now. I don’t know… I don’t remember them having any particular illnesses. Heart trouble, perhaps? Old age takes its toll, doesn't it? I’m not very good at remembering things like that. I’m afraid I can’t be much help with the family history. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. Is this really necessary, Doctor? Can't we just do the blood work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, gathering a thorough history is necessary. It allows me to interpret the lab results accurately, and to ensure I’m providing you with appropriate care. While I understand your frustration, and your difficulty recalling details, it’s vital that I have as much information as possible. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, beyond what you mentioned from the plant doctor?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Besides those pills… nothing regularly. Sometimes I take something for sleep, if I’m really struggling. Just an over-the-counter thing. Melatonin, I think it’s called. And… sometimes I take aspirin for my knees, when they’re particularly bad. Just a couple of tablets. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills. They never seem to do much good, anyway. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I eat my vegetables, I try to get some exercise, and I mostly just try to keep to myself. Is that helpful? Can we please get to the blood work now? It’s a hot day, and I’d really like to get home.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. To clarify, you take melatonin as needed for sleep, and aspirin occasionally for knee pain. I will proceed with ordering a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a lipid panel. However, given your age and limited information, I also recommend a thyroid-stimulating hormone test and a vitamin D level. I would also like to perform a brief physical examination – just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your joints. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination… oh, dear. Look, I really don’t like doctors poking and prodding. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. And I'm running late for… something. But… I suppose a quick check wouldn’t hurt. As long as it’s quick. Just the basics, Doctor. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… and maybe a quick look at my knees? No poking, please. I'm a simple man, remember? Just get it over with, and then we can get to the blood work. The sooner I’m home, the better. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin with your blood pressure. 158 over 82. A bit elevated, as expected. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. Now, regarding your knees… please bend them for me, as comfortably as possible. There is some visible swelling and mild crepitus with movement. Range of motion is limited, and there is tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line of both knees. That concludes the brief examination. Now we can proceed with the blood work. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Finally. Thank goodness. Phlebotomist, you say? Is that the one who… draws the blood? I always get a bit lightheaded, you know. And my veins… they’re not always easy to find. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too much. I'm a simple man, but I do need my blood. Is there anywhere I can sit while I wait? This examination table is terribly uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, the phlebotomist will be drawing your blood. You may sit in that chair if you prefer. Please let the phlebotomist know about your tendency to feel lightheaded. They are experienced and will take appropriate precautions. I will review the results once they are available, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment. Please remain seated until the phlebotomist arrives.
PATIENT: .
