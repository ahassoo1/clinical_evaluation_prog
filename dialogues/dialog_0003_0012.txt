DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, I understand you’re here today seeking medical attention. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Yackey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I’m going on a cruise next month – the tenth of September, to be precise – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just a general health overview, really. Nothing wrong, thankfully. They just want to be sure I’m fit to travel. I was hoping you could help me with that form.
DOCTOR: A pre-travel form, yes. Standard procedure, I suppose. Though frankly, these cruise lines are overly cautious. Still. Let’s get this done efficiently. Now, Ms. Squiers, to properly complete this form, I’ll need a bit of information from you. We’ll start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Chronic conditions. No, not as such. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu in ‘88, but that’s hardly chronic, is it? And my knees do ache a bit when it’s cold, but I wouldn’t call that a condition, more just… being my age, I suppose. I was widowed five years ago, and my husband, God rest his soul, had high blood pressure, but I haven’t ever had any trouble with that myself. I have always been quite healthy, actually. Would that be helpful?
DOCTOR: “Always been quite healthy” is… noted. While I appreciate your optimism, Ms. Squiers, we need to be thorough. To clarify, no diagnoses from a physician of anything – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, heart problems… anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, I see what you mean. You want to be absolutely sure. No, not a formal diagnosis, no. Though, back in ‘92, the doctor did mention my cholesterol was a little high after a check-up, but he said to just watch my diet. I did, mostly. Reduced the cream in my tea, that sort of thing. It wasn’t high enough to… to require anything, he assured me. Just a suggestion, really. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course. I wear reading glasses, you see. But that's hardly a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: Elevated cholesterol, noted. Reading glasses, also noted. It’s just… these questionnaires are so vague. Let's move on before we spend the entire morning cataloging minor inconveniences. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes. Now that you mention it. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, back in 1962. A very common thing, it was, in those days. And I had a rather nasty bunion removed from my left foot in 1978. That was… unpleasant, I must say. Required a rather lengthy recovery, it did. Otherwise, no. Nothing else. Just the tonsils and the bunion. I recall the dates quite vividly, actually. My mother always kept a very detailed diary.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, 1962. Bunionectomy, left foot, 1978. Very good. Now, Ms. Squiers, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, not really. I take a daily vitamin, you know, a multivitamin. And occasionally, if my knees are particularly troublesome, I take paracetamol. Just a couple of tablets, as needed. Nothing regular, certainly. And no prescriptions, no. I pride myself on not needing them. My husband, poor man, was always on something or other. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. I find a good cup of tea and a lie-down does wonders, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, PRN paracetamol. All right. And finally – allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not to anything serious, thankfully. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just a bit of hay fever, really. And I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to a shellfish platter – lobster, I think it was – back in ‘95. But I've avoided lobster ever since, so it's not a problem now. Nothing life-threatening, certainly. No penicillin reactions, or anything like that. I'm quite fortunate, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. That should be sufficient. Now, Ms. Squiers, allow me to perform a brief physical examination to ensure everything is… as you’ve described. It’s a standard procedure, though I suspect it will be largely perfunctory. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh, very good, Doctor. A quick check, you say? That sounds perfectly sensible. I always believe in being thorough. Though, as I said, I am generally in quite good health. My husband always said I was as strong as an ox! Though he might have been exaggerating a bit… But please, do go ahead. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72, regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Knees exhibit mild crepitus with range of motion. No swelling or erythema noted. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Findings within normal limits, consistent with patient report. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Everything appears to be in order. I'll complete the cruise line form, certifying you are fit for travel.
PATIENT: Oh, that is excellent news, Doctor! I am so relieved to hear it. You’re very efficient, I must say. My husband would have appreciated a doctor who didn't fuss. He always hated being poked and prodded. How long will it take to complete the form? And will I need to sign anything? I'm quite eager to get everything sorted before next month. It's a very exciting trip, you see – a Mediterranean cruise. I’ve always dreamed of visiting Greece.
DOCTOR: The form is almost complete. Just a few final details. Here you are. Simply sign on the indicated line. It's rather… bureaucratic, as these things often are. As for time, I should be finished shortly. I trust this meets your requirements. Now, if you have no further questions, I have several other patients waiting. I appreciate your cooperation.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor. Yes, this looks perfectly adequate. There we are. All signed and ready. No, I don’t think I have any further questions, no. You have been most helpful, and very thorough. I appreciate you squeezing me in, particularly. I shall leave the payment with the receptionist, if that’s alright? And thank you once again for your time and expertise. I wish you a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: Very good. The receptionist will handle the payment. And you are welcome. I trust you will enjoy your cruise, despite the… unnecessary formalities. Have a good day, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor! You too. Goodbye!
