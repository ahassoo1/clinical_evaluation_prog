DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Delron. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s… the army. They want me to take a test. Before I can, uh, join properly. Seems silly, really. I feel fine. Always have. But they said I have to get checked out by a doctor first. Waste of time, if you ask me. But my wife… she insisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're following through with the army's requirements, and even better that your wife encouraged you to come in. It’s never a waste of time to make sure everything is healthy, especially before starting something new like joining the army. So, this is a pre-enlistment physical, then?
PATIENT: Physical, check-up, whatever you call it. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those words. Just gotta get a piece of paper saying I’m not falling apart, I guess. I'm a strong man, always have been. Worked with engines my whole life, you know? That takes a bit of muscle. Not like these kids today, glued to their screens all day. So, what sort of things are you going to… do? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Delron. It's good you've been keeping active with engine work – that’s a good base to start from. We just want to get a good overall picture of your health to make sure you’re fit for service, and to rule out anything that might cause problems down the line. The exam will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and doing a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also ask you some questions about your medical history, any medications you take, and your family’s health. We might also do some bloodwork and a urine sample, just to get a bit more detailed information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine sample? Really? Look, I told you, I’m fine. I eat sensible, sleep alright, maybe a bit of beer on the weekends, but nothing crazy. My wife makes me eat a lot of fish. Seems unnecessary, all this poking and prodding. Is it absolutely necessary to give a sample? I mean, couldn’t you just… ask me if anything hurts? It’s all common sense, isn’t it? And I don’t take any medication. Never have.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delron. It does seem like a lot, and you’re right, common sense goes a long way. But the bloodwork and urine sample help us pick up things that you wouldn’t necessarily feel or be able to tell me about. Things like kidney function, hidden infections, or even early signs of diabetes. It’s just a standard part of the pre-enlistment process, and it helps protect both you and the army. We will definitely ask about any pain or discomfort you’re experiencing, and that’s a very important part of the exam. But the lab tests give us a more complete picture. It's a pretty simple process. I have a collection cup in the restroom, and instructions are posted on the door. Would you be willing to do that for me?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t like this. My wife is going to have a field day if I tell her I'm being made to… produce a sample. It’s degrading, frankly. And for what? I guarantee I’m healthier than half the recruits these days. Couldn’t you just skip it? I’m a strong man. I lift heavy things. That’s all the test I need. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here. Is there anyone else I can speak to? Maybe a manager? Someone with a little… sense?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Delron, and I apologize if this is making you feel uneasy. It’s not my intention to make you feel degraded, and I appreciate you being honest about how you feel. Unfortunately, as part of the military's requirements for enlistment, a urine sample is mandatory. It's a policy set by them, and I'm obligated to follow it to ensure you meet their health standards. I don't have the authority to bypass it. I can assure you the process is private and confidential. The sample will be sent to a lab for analysis, and I will only receive the results. I realize this isn't what you want to hear, but completing the urine sample will allow us to proceed with the physical and hopefully get you one step closer to joining the army. Would you like me to show you the restroom and explain the process again?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. But my wife is hearing about this. This is ridiculous. Lead the way. And I expect complete discretion. Don't go making jokes about it. And it better be quick. I haven't got all day, you know. My time is valuable. Engines don't fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Delron. I completely understand. I assure you, this will be handled with complete discretion. I won't make any jokes, and I'll keep things as quick and efficient as possible. Here’s the restroom. There are instructions on the door, and I've left a collection cup on the counter. Please let me know if you have any questions. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Take your time.
