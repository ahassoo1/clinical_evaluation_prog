DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Schlatterer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Schlatterer. And please, let’s not dawdle. I have… commitments. Is this going to be a lengthy process?
DOCTOR: Well, that depends on what’s bothering you. Let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Honestly. It’s… the library. The students. It's simply dreadful. They have no respect for books, no discipline. And the administration… utterly useless. It’s all quite stressful, you understand. Though I suspect you won’t comprehend the pressures of academia. It’s… diminishing, the whole profession. Now, are you going to ask me questions, or simply stare?
DOCTOR: Right. Stress. Okay. Let's focus on you, Mr. Schlatterer. Not the students, not the administration. Has this stress been causing you any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Good heavens. What do you take me for, a weakling? I suppose… my appetite isn’t what it once was. And I do find myself… rather tired. But that’s to be expected at my age, isn’t it? It’s not as though I’m ill. Just… worn down. Is that sufficient, or do you require a detailed catalogue of every minor ache and pain? Honestly, the bureaucracy of it all…
DOCTOR: Appetite changes and fatigue. Okay. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? It feels like an eternity, frankly. Months, certainly. Perhaps… a year? Time blurs, you know. Especially when one is surrounded by… chaos. It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely. I’ve simply been… enduring. Is a precise date absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: It helps to get a sense of the timeline, Mr. Schlatterer. Has anything specifically changed in the last year, besides the… library situation?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well, my ex-wife remarried. A rather… flamboyant fellow, if I may say so. That was… unsettling. And I had to replace the gutters on the house. A dreadful expense. But beyond that… no, not really. The library has been consistently dreadful for years. It’s hardly a sudden development. Are we getting anywhere with this? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Well, I wouldn’t say trouble, exactly. More… insufficient. I wake frequently. Thinking, naturally. About the library, about… everything. It’s not a restful experience, I assure you. A perfectly good mind should be at peace, not dissecting the inadequacies of modern education. Though I doubt you'd understand. Now, is there a conclusion to this interrogation?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little stiffness in the back, perhaps. Old age, you understand. Nothing to concern oneself with. I refuse to become one of these hypochondriacs, constantly complaining about every minor discomfort. Now, if you'll excuse me… I really must be going. This has been… remarkably unproductive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Please, sit on the examination table.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? I assure you, doctor, I am perfectly healthy. This is quite unnecessary. I came here to discuss stress, not to be prodded and poked like some… laboratory specimen. I strongly object. Honestly, the indignity of it all… This is a waste of my time. I think I'll just… leave. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. If you insist. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider. These symptoms, even if you dismiss them, could indicate something serious. I can write you a referral to a… stress management program, if you’d like. Otherwise, I suggest you get some rest and avoid… stimulating environments. .
