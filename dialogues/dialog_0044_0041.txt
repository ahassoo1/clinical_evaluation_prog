DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. Welcome. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's… my legs, mostly. They just aren't what they used to be. Getting weaker, you see. It's been happening slowly, but now it's making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman, I understand. Your legs are feeling weaker, and it's starting to impact your daily life. That's a good place to start. When you say “slowly,” can you give me a rough timeline?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, maybe… a year ago? Little things at first. Tripping a bit more. Feeling tired after walking. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s gotten…steadier. Not a sudden change, just…less strength each month, I suppose. It's hard to say exactly. Time… it goes quickly when you're older.
DOCTOR: You're right, it certainly does. And it’s good you're paying attention to these changes. So, over the past year, a gradual decrease in leg strength, with no specific injury or sudden onset. Is the weakness the same in both legs, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: It's… mostly the left leg now. The right one feels a bit weak too, but not as bad. It’s the left one that really gives me trouble. Sometimes it feels… heavy, almost like I’m dragging it. And… and it gets tired very quickly. Even just walking to the mailbox, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily left leg weakness, with some involvement of the right, but significantly less. Heavy feeling, tires easily, even with minimal exertion like walking to the mailbox. Do you notice any pain associated with this weakness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. It's not a sharp thing or anything. Sometimes a little ache, but it’s not… bothersome. Mostly just… uncomfortable. Like it's not working right, you see? More like a tiredness in the muscle, not around it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp pain, more of a muscle tiredness or discomfort, primarily in the left leg. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, a little. In my feet sometimes. Not all the time, and it’s not… bad, really. Just a sort of… pins and needles feeling, mostly at night. It goes away after I move around a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pins and needles feeling in your feet, primarily at night, that resolves with movement. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things. Have you experienced any changes in your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Changes… in my… oh. Well, yes, actually. A little harder to… start sometimes. Not every time, but more often than it used to be. And… and I have to go to the bathroom more often, even if I haven't had much to drink. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, but… yes, that's been happening.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Dorman. It’s important information. So, difficulty initiating urination sometimes, and increased frequency of urination. Have you noticed any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That too. I… stumble a little more than I used to. Not falling, mind you, but… I feel unsteady sometimes. Especially when I turn my head quickly. My wife, Leilani, she’s noticed it too. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Leilani is right to be attentive. Feeling unsteady and stumbling, especially when turning your head, is good information. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor got that sorted with some pills. I take those every day. And… I had a bad flu when I was younger, but that’s about it. Nothing else, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed hypertension, controlled with medication. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the blood pressure pills. One in the morning, one at night. That’s it. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can. Leilani makes sure I take them, of course. She's very good at keeping me on track.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and very considerate of Leilani. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies at all. Never had one. I can eat anything, take most anything, as long as the doctor says it's alright. I've always been pretty strong, even as a boy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. And I haven't been to the hospital since I was a young man. A broken arm when I was playing football, but that was a long time ago. They fixed it right up. Nothing since then, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from a childhood broken arm. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My father, he was a strong man, lived to be 85. He had a bit of trouble with his hands when he got older, shaking a little. My mother, she passed away when I was young. And… well, my sister, she had some trouble walking when she was older too. Something with her nerves, I think. It wasn't as bad as what I’m feeling, but… something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, father lived to 85 with some hand tremors, mother passed away young, and sister had some walking difficulties related to her nerves. That's helpful. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be very active. Played football when I was young, worked hard all my life. Now, I mostly like to sit and watch the games on television. I like to garden a little bit, but it's getting harder now with my legs. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Leilani cooks very good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, previously active, now more sedentary, no smoking or excessive alcohol use, generally healthy diet. That’s good to know. Thank you, Dorman, that gives me a very good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. I'm ready when you are. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's going on with my legs.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. First, let’s check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished in both legs, but more pronounced on the left. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There you go. Not as much strength as I used to have, I’m afraid. It's getting harder and harder to grip things, too. Leilani notices it when I help her with the gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now I'm going to ask you to try and resist me as I push and pull on your arms and legs. Just try to hold your position. Alright, your arms seem pretty good. The left leg is significantly weaker than the right. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There we go. A little shaky, but I can stand. It’s… harder than it used to be, as you can see. I have to hold on to the table to feel steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Oh… whoa. That's… worse. I'm definitely losing my balance now. I need to hold on tight!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Dorman. Please sit back down. That's good information. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, Dorman, based on your history and the physical exam, your symptoms are suggestive of a few possibilities. The weakness in your legs, the pins and needles sensation, the difficulty with balance, and the changes in bladder function all point towards a potential issue with your nerves. It could be related to something called peripheral neuropathy, or possibly something affecting your spinal cord. It’s also important to consider vascular issues, but your pulses feel normal. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on. It's just… unsettling, not knowing. So, yes, please. Order whatever tests you need. I trust your judgement. What kind of tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand. The tests will help us narrow down the cause and get you the right treatment. I'd like to start with a blood test to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and inflammation. I’d also like to order an MRI of your spine to rule out any issues with your spinal cord. And finally, a nerve conduction study and electromyography, or EMG, which will measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles. That will give us a better understanding of how well your nerves are functioning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI… nerve tests… yes, Doctor. Sounds… thorough. A little frightening, but I understand. It’s better to know, you’re right. So, yes, please. All of them. What do I need to do to prepare for these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to tell Leilani something, you know. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. For the blood test, you don't need to do any special preparation – just don't eat anything for 8 hours beforehand. For the MRI, you'll need to remove any metal jewelry or clothing with metal. The technician will give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. The nerve conduction study and EMG may be a little uncomfortable, but it's usually well-tolerated. They'll place some small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week to get everything back. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review them together as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active as much as you comfortably can, but avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. And it’s good you'll talk to Leilani – keeping her informed will help alleviate her worries. I’ll also write a note explaining the tests we’re ordering and what to expect. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough. Eight hours for the blood test… no metal for the MRI… and take it easy. I can do that. Leilani will be glad to hear you're writing a note. She's always worried I won't remember things. Thank you, Doctor Asami. I appreciate your time and your patience. I’ll schedule those tests right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. I'm glad I could help. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse is always available to assist. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
