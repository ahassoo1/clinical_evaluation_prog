DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're thirty-seven years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about my stomach. It’s been…awful. And nothing seems to be helping. I’ve tried… things. I don’t even want to get into it. Just… constant diarrhea. It’s embarrassing even talking about it. Can we just skip the details and get to fixing it?
DOCTOR: While I understand your…discomfort discussing this, Ms. Woodring, a thorough history is essential for accurate diagnosis. “Constant diarrhea” is, unfortunately, quite vague. We need to establish when it started, what it looks like – color, consistency – if there's any blood or mucus, and whether anything specifically triggers it or alleviates it. It will help us determine the most appropriate course of action. But very well. We can attempt to expedite things. Has this been a recent development, or has this been occurring for some time?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a painter, okay? I don’t sit around analyzing my…output. It’s been going on for weeks, maybe a month? I don't know. Long enough that it's ruining my life. It’s watery. Brown. Sometimes… darker. And no, I haven’t noticed anything specific. I eat normal food. I haven’t changed anything. Is that good enough for you? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: "Normal food" is, regrettably, a subjective term, Ms. Woodring. And a month of persistent diarrhea is…concerning. While I appreciate your desire for expediency, I must ask some further clarifying questions to adequately assess your condition. Do you experience any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I do! What do you think this is, a pleasant experience? My stomach cramps, it feels bloated, and it hurts. It's uncomfortable, okay? Like a constant twisting. I don’t need a detailed analysis of the precise type of pain, just… it hurts. Look, I'm a practical person. I deal with problems. I fix them. I don't spend hours describing them. Can we please just figure out what medication will stop it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, while I understand your frustration, a hasty approach to medication can be…detrimental. We must rule out more serious possibilities before simply attempting symptomatic relief. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No vomiting. Just… the diarrhea. And the cramping. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I don't know all these fancy things you're asking about. It’s just… my stomach. Bad. Always bad. It’s been bad since…well, it doesn't matter. Can we just get to the point? I have work to do. People are waiting on me. Is there a pill you can prescribe? Any pill? I don't care what it is, as long as it works.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I assure you, I am attempting to ascertain the cause of your discomfort, not merely mask the symptoms. While I sympathize with your professional commitments, providing medication without a proper diagnosis would be… irresponsible. Do you have any family history of gastrointestinal issues – irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, perhaps?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. My husband… passed away a few years ago. We weren’t close with either of our families. I didn’t spend a lot of time asking about their… digestive problems, okay? I was busy. Now I’m… well, it doesn’t matter. No. I don't know anything about family history. Can we please, please just skip this? I'm starting to feel like I’m wasting my time. I came here for a solution, not a twenty-question game. I need something to stop this. Now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. Given your…reluctance to provide a detailed history, and the lack of any reported alarming symptoms, I will proceed with a basic physical examination. However, please understand that this may not be sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate it to check for tenderness. Please lie back on the examination table, and let me know if anything causes you discomfort.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Just… hurry. And be gentle. This is already unpleasant enough.
DOCTOR: Your bowel sounds are…hyperactive. That is not unexpected with diarrhea, but it does not provide us with much clarity. And…there is some mild tenderness here, in the left lower quadrant. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah. That’s… uncomfortable. Not awful, but… yeah, that hurts a little. Like a dull ache. It's been feeling like that for a while, actually. What does that even mean? Is it serious? I just want to know if you can fix it.
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant, coupled with hyperactive bowel sounds…this could indicate several possibilities. While it doesn't immediately suggest a critical emergency, it warrants further investigation. To rule out infection, I'd like to order a stool sample analysis. It will check for bacteria, parasites, and other potential causes of your diarrhea. Additionally, given your… lack of detailed history, and the duration of your symptoms, I recommend a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will assess your overall health and electrolyte levels. Does that sound acceptable, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? Look, I don't have time for all this. Can't you just give me something to stop it? An anti-diarrheal, anything? I’ll try it. I’m a grown woman, I can handle a little medicine. This is ridiculous. Fine. Whatever. Tests. But I’m telling you, if this doesn’t work, I’m going somewhere else. Just tell me where to go to…do the thing.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. I understand your…frustration. The nurse will provide you with the necessary collection containers and instructions for the stool sample. I will order the blood work as well, and it can be completed at the lab just down the hall. In the meantime, given your persistent symptoms, I will prescribe a low dose of loperamide—an anti-diarrheal medication—to provide some symptomatic relief. However, I must emphasize that this is not a long-term solution. It is essential to identify and address the underlying cause of your diarrhea. I will also provide you with instructions regarding hydration and dietary modifications. Avoid dairy products, fatty foods, and caffeine, and ensure you drink plenty of fluids. Here are your instructions and the prescription. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results of your tests. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. Please take care. And do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition. .
