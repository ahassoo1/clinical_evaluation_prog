DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it's… my family. Lots of sickness, you see. My mother, she… she had problems with her heart. And my brother, cancer. I just want to make sure I'm okay. I don't want any surprises, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history is important, certainly. Though, worrying about things before they happen isn't usually the most productive approach, is it?
PATIENT: I know, I know. It's hard though, Doctor. When you see things… bad things… happen to people you love. It makes you think. I just want to be sure, you know? Maybe some tests? To check things? I don't really understand what tests, but… something.
DOCTOR: Well, we can certainly do some tests. Though, at your age, running a full battery of them just because you're… apprehensive?
PATIENT: Apprehensive? Is that… bad? I just… Medicare covers things, doesn't it? I don't want to waste your time, or the money, but… if there's a way to know… to be sure… wouldn't that be worth it? My brother… he didn't find out until it was too late. I don’t want that.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schwer. We're not going to start running tests just because of family history and anxiety. That's not how medicine works. Let's start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. I get tired, maybe. But I’m 73, Doctor! Everyone gets tired. No chest pain, no coughing… nothing like that. Just… worried. A lot of worrying. I sleep okay, eat okay… I walk every morning, about a mile. Is that good? I try to stay active. But the worrying… it's always there.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no acute complaints. No fever, chills, weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. I think I lost a little weight… but that might be just because the summer is so hot. I don't have much appetite when it's this warm. Nothing sudden though, Doctor. Just… gradual. Is gradual bad? I don’t know anymore what’s normal and what’s not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long, and it might put your mind at ease. Sit back, please.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Just to know everything is… working. That would be good. I appreciate you listening to me. It’s hard to explain all this… the worry, you know?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur present, likely benign age-related change. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarming. Do you have any history of hypertension?
PATIENT: Hypertension… is that high blood pressure? No, I don’t think so. The doctor back home… Dr. Chen… he checked it sometimes, but never said anything about it being a problem. Just said to watch my salt intake. Is that bad? The salt? I like a little salt on my eggs. But not too much. I try to be careful. Is that what you mean? Is my salt bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, we're getting sidetracked. A little salt isn't going to cause a major health crisis. But consistently elevated blood pressure can be a problem. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing at all. Just… vitamins, sometimes. But I forget to take them half the time. Old age, you know? The memory… it's not what it used to be. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the vitamins. And sometimes, a little ibuprofen for my knee, if it's acting up. But not often. Really. I try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve been stung by bees a few times, but nothing more than a little swelling. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My wife… she was allergic to dust… but that was her, not me. No, no allergies. Not that I remember. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, everything seems relatively stable. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not urgently concerning. We can monitor it. I recommend a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck it, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications to help manage it. We can also consider a basic blood panel to get a better overview of your overall health, if you'd like. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good, Doctor. Three months. And the blood panel… yes, that would be good. To… to know. Just to know everything is okay. Or… if it's not, to know that too. I appreciate you listening to me. I was just… worried. A lot of worry. So, three months. I'll remember that. I think. Is there a card I can take with the date? Just to be sure?
DOCTOR: Here you go. The appointment is scheduled for November 2nd at 10:00 AM. Please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. And try to focus on reducing your stress. Easier said than done, I know. I’ll also send a note to the front desk to remind you about the fasting instructions. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: November 2nd… good. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you for not thinking I was silly. All the worrying… it feels foolish sometimes. But you listened. That means a lot. And remind me about the fasting… my memory… it's not what it used to be. Thank you again, Doctor Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome, Mr. Schwer. Have a good day. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk.
