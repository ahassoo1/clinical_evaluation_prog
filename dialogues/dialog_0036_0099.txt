DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results from a test – a GI endoscopy, I believe it was called – and the doctor who ordered it suggested I come in to discuss them with you. He said there were some…abnormalities. I must admit, I was a little worried when he said that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Denis. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear the word “abnormalities.” We’ll go over those results together, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. First, let me pull up those endoscopy results in your chart. Okay, I see them here. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for the past several months, I’ve been experiencing some…discomfort in my stomach. Mostly, it’s a burning sensation, and sometimes a bit of nausea. It wasn't constant, but frequent enough to be bothersome. I also noticed a change in my…well, my bowel movements. They weren’t regular, and occasionally there was blood. My primary physician thought it best to investigate further, so he recommended the endoscopy. He said it would allow him to see what was causing the issues. I believe I mentioned all of this to him when I had the procedure done.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed information, Denis. That’s very helpful. So, burning sensation, nausea, irregular bowel movements, and blood in the stool – those are all important clues. And you’re right to recall mentioning those symptoms to your primary physician. To get a clearer picture, let's talk a bit more about the symptoms. When did you first start noticing these issues?
PATIENT: Let me see…if I recall correctly, it began sometime in late November of last year. It was very mild at first, just a little discomfort after meals. I didn’t think much of it; I assumed it was something I ate. But it gradually worsened over the following months, and by February, it was quite noticeable. That’s when I decided to see my doctor. He initially thought it might be stress, but when the symptoms persisted, he ordered some tests. I believe it was around the beginning of April when I had the endoscopy done. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that timeline is very helpful. So, starting mild in November, progressively worsening, and the endoscopy in April. Now, regarding that burning sensation, can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe precisely. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a persistent ache, located in the upper part of my stomach. It often occurs after I eat, though not always. Sometimes it radiates towards my back, but mostly it’s confined to my stomach. It’s a…gnawing sensation, I suppose. It doesn't keep me up at night, but it's definitely uncomfortable and distracting. And sometimes, it feels like…pressure, as if something is squeezing my stomach. I’ve tried taking antacids, and they offer some temporary relief, but the sensation always returns.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gnawing, burning sensation in the upper stomach, sometimes radiating to the back, and relieved temporarily by antacids. That’s useful information. Now, let's talk about those irregular bowel movements and the blood you noticed. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It wasn't…a large amount, thankfully. It was more of a…streaking on the stool, a bright red color. It didn’t happen every time, maybe once or twice a week. And it wasn’t a constant flow, just a small amount visible on the surface of the stool. It was rather alarming, of course, and that prompted me to see my doctor immediately. I must admit, that was the most concerning symptom of all. The irregularity itself wasn’t constant either; sometimes I would go several times a day, other times I would struggle to go at all. It was quite unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red streaking on the stool, occurring intermittently, and unpredictable bowel habits. Thank you for being so specific, Denis. Before we look at the endoscopy results, I'd like to ask a few more general questions. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, let me see. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for many years. I also had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that, I’ve been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of, and I'm not currently taking any medications besides the medication for my blood pressure. I had a bout of the flu last winter, but that was a minor issue and resolved quickly. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. No allergies, and no other medications besides the blood pressure medication. Now, let’s take a look at these endoscopy results. Okay… the report indicates some inflammation in the esophagus and stomach, and it notes the presence of several small ulcers in the stomach lining. The biopsy results show evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Does that mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Inflammation and ulcers...that doesn’t sound good. Helicobacter pylori…no, I don't believe I've heard of that. Is that…serious? Is that what caused the ulcers and the inflammation? I confess, I’m not very familiar with medical terms. Is it something I caught? I’ve always been very careful with my diet and hygiene. I appreciate you explaining this to me, Doctor. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Denis. Let’s break it down. Helicobacter pylori, often called H. pylori, is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. It’s quite common, and many people don’t even know they have it. It can cause inflammation and ulcers, which explains what the endoscopy showed. It's not something you “catch” in the traditional sense, like a cold. It’s often spread through contaminated food or water, but it can also be spread from person to person. It doesn’t mean you’ve been unhygienic; it simply means you were exposed to it at some point. The good news is, it’s very treatable. We can get rid of the H. pylori with a course of antibiotics, usually combined with other medications to reduce stomach acid. It often resolves these types of issues. Before we proceed with a treatment plan, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That…sounds reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam seems prudent. And I am relieved to hear it is treatable, that is very reassuring. The thought of needing antibiotics is not ideal, but preferable to…well, whatever the alternative might be. Yes, please proceed with the exam. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Denis. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and I’ll gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness. Please lie back on the examination table. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That’s quite alright. I will let you know immediately if I feel any discomfort. I must confess, I am a bit anxious, but I trust your expertise. Please proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your bowel sounds now… they're present, which is good. There is some mild tenderness in the upper part of your stomach, where we expect it given the endoscopy results. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely there. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is also reassuring. Your abdomen is soft, and there's no evidence of any masses. Okay, the physical exam confirms some tenderness in the upper abdomen, consistent with the inflammation we’ve identified. Based on your symptoms, the endoscopy results, and the physical exam, it appears you have gastritis and peptic ulcers caused by H. pylori infection. It's important that we treat this to prevent complications such as bleeding or perforation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Gastritis and peptic ulcers…yes, that clarifies things somewhat. Preventing complications sounds…wise. I confess, bleeding and perforation are rather alarming terms. So, the H. pylori is the culprit, and eradicating it will resolve the issue? What is involved in the treatment? Are there any side effects to the medication? I appreciate you taking the time to explain all of this to me so thoroughly, Doctor. It eases my anxieties considerably.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I understand your concerns, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Yes, eradicating the H. pylori is the goal. The treatment typically involves a combination of medications taken for 10 to 14 days. This usually includes: Two antibiotics: To kill the H. pylori bacteria. A proton pump inhibitor : To reduce stomach acid, allowing the ulcers to heal. Possibly a bismuth subsalicylate: This can also help protect the stomach lining and kill the bacteria. Common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and changes in taste. In rare cases, there can be more serious side effects, but those are uncommon. We'll monitor you closely during treatment. Before we start, I'd like to do some blood tests to check your liver function and make sure you don’t have any allergies. Also, we can do a stool test to confirm the presence of H. pylori. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a stool test…that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Confirming the presence of the bacteria seems prudent. No, I don’t have any questions about that. I trust your judgment regarding the tests. When would we schedule those? And once the results are back, what is the process for obtaining the medication? Will I need a prescription? Also, are there any dietary restrictions I should adhere to during the treatment period? I apologize for the numerous questions, but I prefer to be well-informed.
DOCTOR: You’re not imposing at all, Denis. It’s good you’re asking questions! We can draw the blood and collect the stool sample today. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. Once the results are back, which usually takes 2-3 business days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and I’ll write you a prescription for the medication. Regarding dietary restrictions, it’s best to avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, alcohol, and caffeine during the treatment period, as these can irritate the stomach lining. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can also help. Beyond that, try to stick to a bland, easily digestible diet. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that addresses all of my concerns for the moment. Avoiding spicy foods, acidic foods, and caffeine…that seems manageable. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly and patiently. I feel much more confident about proceeding with the treatment now. Shall we proceed with the blood tests and stool sample then? I am ready when you are. Perhaps you could direct me to the lab?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Yes, let's proceed with the blood tests and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall to your left. You’ll see a sign for “Laboratory Services.” The technician, Maria, is very efficient and will guide you through the process. She’ll need you to provide your insurance information, though you mentioned being uninsured, so you may need to speak with the billing department afterwards. After you've completed the tests, come back to me, and we’ll discuss next steps. Do you have any trouble walking or need any assistance getting there?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you for the offer, but I am quite capable of walking. I believe I can find my way to the lab without difficulty. I appreciate your consideration nonetheless. I shall return once I have completed the tests. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you need anything along the way. I’ll see you soon.
