DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time, I think. Honestly, the days all kind of blend together. It’s just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Always tired” is… vague, but it's a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Vague… yes, that’s a good word for it. It’s not like I’ve been doing anything extra. I just… wake up tired. And it doesn’t really get better during the day. I try to rest when I can, but even naps don’t help much. I used to… I think I used to have more energy. Before… well, before my husband. It’s hard to remember exactly when it started, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can appreciate that. It’s understandable that it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when things changed. Just trying to get a sense of how it’s affecting your daily life now. Are you finding it difficult to do things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I used to… I loved gardening, but I just… don’t have the energy anymore. And keeping the house clean? Forget about it. It’s a mess, honestly. I mostly just… sit. I watch television. It's not a life, really. It’s just… easier than trying to do everything and failing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the tiredness is impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, and it's leading to a decrease in activity. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms… um… Sometimes I feel a little dizzy. And my muscles ache, but that could just be old age, I suppose. Oh! And I’ve been forgetting things a lot lately. More than usual, anyway. It’s just… little things. Where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence... Things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, muscle aches, and some memory issues. When you say memory issues, are these recent or have they been going on for a long time as well?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I think… they've gotten worse lately. Like, I used to just misplace things, but now it’s… harder to find the words, you know? I feel like I’m stumbling over my sentences all the time. It's embarrassing, honestly. Before…well, I don’t know. It’s all a bit of a blur, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like these memory issues are relatively new and progressing, which is important to note. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Let me see… I had the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. And my blood pressure was a little high once, but the doctor said it was just stress. Honestly, I don’t really remember much else. I used to go to the doctor regularly with my husband, and he handled all the details. After… well, it all became a bit of a blur, you know? I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful to know. And I understand it’s difficult to recall details. We can look things up in the system if needed. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical issues, like heart problems, diabetes, or memory loss?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he always complained about his heart, but he lived to be 85, so it couldn't have been that bad. I don't really know. We weren't very close, to be honest. And there weren't many of us left. I'm afraid I'm not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We can work with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think I take something for my blood pressure, but I’m not sure what it is. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my aches, but just when they’re really bad. That’s it, I think. I don’t really like taking pills, so I don't take much. I’m honestly not very good at keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a list of your medications sorted out. It's important to know exactly what you’re taking, even if it’s just occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Well, except for… I don't like shellfish, but that's just a taste thing, not an allergy. I think I'm fine. Honestly, I’m just tired, Doctor. All this remembering is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Honestly, I just want to figure out why I'm so tired. The sooner the better. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. I'll also do a quick neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and balance. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. I’ll note that in your chart. Lungs sound clear on both sides. Ears are clear, throat looks normal. Now, let's just do a few simple balance tests… Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh… There… just a little dizzy, I think. It happens sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A little unsteady, but you recovered quickly. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Alright. Based on this brief exam, you’re exhibiting some concerning symptoms: tiredness, memory issues, dizziness, and diminished reflexes. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there’s a murmur I'll want to investigate further. I think we need to run some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, Vitamin B12 and D levels, and a metabolic panel. We should also consider a brain scan, like an MRI, to rule out any structural problems.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a lot. Tests… a scan… It sounds serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something bad? I just want to feel normal again. Honestly, all this is very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Janie. It is a lot, and it’s natural to be frightened. But it’s important to remember that these tests are simply to gather information. They'll help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency or thyroid problem. Or, it could be something more serious. But we won't know until we have the results of the tests. I'm going to order these tests right away. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll need you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you have the results. I suggest we do that in about two weeks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, alright. That sounds… okay. Just… please, Doctor, find out what’s wrong. I just want to feel like myself again. Honestly, I’m starting to forget what that feels like.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie. And I will do my very best. We’ll get to the bottom of this, together. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion. It's always good to have another perspective, especially with cognitive issues. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe dizziness, weakness, or any sudden changes in your vision – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think I’ve heard too much already. Just… tests. And a neurologist. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Honestly, Doctor, thank you for listening. And for… trying to help. I’m just… very tired.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. It’s my job. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Here are the lab orders and the referral to the neurologist. My office will call to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results of the tests. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care of yourself, Janie. And try to get some rest. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you. I… I think I’ll go home and try to rest. If I can. Honestly, I’m not very hopeful, but… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Take care. .
