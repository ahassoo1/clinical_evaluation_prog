DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Tosca. It is very nice to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking something. A little bit of liquid comes out. It started maybe three days ago, I think. August 2nd, yes? Today is August 2nd.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, today is August 2nd. Thank you for letting me know. Okay, leaking from the ear… can you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow, but not much. Not like… thick, you understand? Very watery. And it does not… smell bad, if that is important. It just… comes out. Not a lot, but enough to be… bothersome. I have to wipe it away.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Clear or slightly yellow, watery discharge, no odor… Okay. And is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… much. A little bit of… pressure, sometimes. Like… when I move my head quickly. Not a sharp pain, you understand? Just… uncomfortable. And my ear feels… full. Like something is inside. It is hard to explain. I do not have… fever, if you are wondering. I checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pressure, fullness, a little discomfort with movement, no fever. Have you noticed any hearing changes – is your hearing worse, muffled, or ringing in your ear at all?
PATIENT: Yes, good question, Doctor. My hearing… it is a little bit quiet. Not very much, but… things are not as clear as they used to be. Like… when people speak, I have to ask them to repeat sometimes. And… yes. There is a ringing. A very small ringing. It is always there, but I only… notice it when it is quiet. Like now, maybe. I do not know if you hear it.
DOCTOR: No, I don't hear anything right now, but that doesn't mean it's not there. Okay, so some hearing loss and ringing in the ear along with the discharge and pressure. Have you had any recent ear infections, or any other problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Many years ago, when I was… younger, I had an ear infection. Maybe when I was a boy. I do not remember very well. It was… painful. But I do not have… problems since then. No. Nothing like this before. I have not been… swimming recently. Or had anything in my ears. No. Just… the leaking. It is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of an ear infection a long time ago, but nothing recent. No recent swimming or foreign objects in the ear. I understand your concern. Let's take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope, it has a light on the end. It won't hurt, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. A light? That is… alright. Please, go slowly. And I will tell you if something is… not right. I trust you. Just… be gentle. My ear is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see some redness inside your ear canal and your eardrum appears slightly bulging. There's also some fluid present. It looks like you likely have an outer ear infection – otitis externa. The redness and bulging suggest inflammation and the fluid explains the discharge you've been experiencing. It's likely this is causing the pressure, hearing loss, and ringing as well. Do you have any allergies to ear drops, or any skin conditions on your outer ear?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I do not think so. I have never… reacted to anything like that. Skin conditions? No. My outer ear is… normal. Just… the leaking. I wash it with soap and water. Is that… alright? Should I not do that? It is… very strange. I have never had this happen before. I always keep it clean.
DOCTOR: Washing it with soap and water is generally fine, but sometimes it can irritate the infection further. It’s good you're keeping it clean, but we need to treat the infection itself. I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops – they’re antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. You’ll need to use them twice a day for seven days. I’ll also give you a small amount of pain relief medication if the discomfort becomes bothersome. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Seven days… twice a day? Yes, I can do that. And pain relief… just in case? That is… good. Do I need to… tilt my head when I put the drops in? Or… lie down? I want to make sure I do it correctly. And… is this… contagious? Can I give it to someone else? My grandson… he visits sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. You'll want to lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Gently pull your earlobe up and back to straighten the ear canal, then put the prescribed number of drops into your ear. Stay lying down for a few minutes to allow the drops to work. And no, this type of ear infection isn’t typically contagious. Your grandson should be fine. It’s caused by bacteria or fungi growing in your ear canal, it’s not something he can catch from you. Here are the instructions, and the prescription for the drops. Let me know if anything is unclear. I’d like to see you back in one week to check your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then – if you develop a fever, severe pain, or notice any drainage of blood from your ear – please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor Tosca. Lie on my side, pull my ear… and stay still. I can do that. And one week… to check. I will remember. No fever, no blood… I will watch for those things. Thank you very much, Doctor. You have… explained everything very clearly. I feel… much better now. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care. .
