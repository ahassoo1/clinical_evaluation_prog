DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for more than 48 hours. That's good to know. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they come and go, of course. Not constant, thankfully. But they happen… a lot. It feels like… a normal hiccup, you know? Like a little jolt in my chest and then… hic… there it is again! Sorry. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s just… disruptive. I manage an event space, so I need to talk to people all day. It's hard to be professional when you’re hic… doing that.
DOCTOR: Right, disruptive is a good way to put it, especially with your job. And no pain associated with them, that's good. Now, did anything specific happen right before they started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Nothing major. I was setting up for a corporate party on Monday. Lots of lifting boxes, moving chairs… a little stressful, maybe? And I had a really big glass of iced tea with lunch. That's about it, really. hic Oh, and I laughed a lot at a funny video my niece sent me. Is that… is that a cause?
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting, stress, iced tea, and laughter. All potential triggers. Have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Lots of things. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my friend told me to scare myself, so I tried watching a horror movie clip. Nothing worked. I even tried sugar, a spoonful of sugar, like Mary Poppins! hic Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to get desperate. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. We've tried some common remedies without success. Let's do a quick exam just to rule anything else out, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. hic I just want them to stop. What sort of exam? Will it be uncomfortable? I'm a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be uncomfortable at all. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It’s pretty routine. I just want to make sure everything sounds clear and there’s no tenderness. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started.
PATIENT: Okay. hic Alright. shifts onto the examination table Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. This is… unsettling, being here. Not a fan of doctors, if I'm honest. But thank you for seeing me, Doctor. hic It’s really… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in and out for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just... normal pressure, I guess. A little uncomfortable being poked at, but no actual pain. hic Is something wrong? It's been so long, I'm starting to worry it's something serious. I keep thinking of my uncle… he had trouble with his breathing once, and… hic Never mind. It’s probably silly to worry.
DOCTOR: No, it's not silly to worry at all. Your uncle’s situation sounds concerning, and it's good you're being mindful of your health. Everything feels normal so far, but persistent hiccups can sometimes be a symptom of other things, even if it's uncommon. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever. Not nauseous. No heartburn, thankfully. I haven't lost my appetite, I'm still eating normally. I feel a little… tired, maybe? But that could just be from not sleeping well with all the hic… hiccups. No dizziness or headaches, no trouble swallowing. Just… hic the hiccups. And a bit of general annoyance, if that counts! I manage a busy space, so I’m always a little stressed, but this is beyond normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no nausea, normal appetite, no dizziness. Tiredness is likely related. Let’s review your medical history quickly, just to be thorough. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was it. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no asthma, nothing like that. I'm generally a healthy person, I think. I try to eat well when I can, and I walk as much as possible. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. hic And maybe some antacids if I eat something spicy, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, otherwise generally healthy, no regular medications. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, no food restrictions. I haven’t had a bad reaction to anything in my life, as far as I remember. hic My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I haven't been stung. I don’t have any skin allergies either. No trouble with pollen or dust, or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. hic Aside from these persistent hiccups, of course!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And family history – any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart disease, but he was a smoker, so that’s not surprising. My mother had arthritis, and her brother had diabetes. And, like I said, my uncle had some trouble with his breathing, but I don’t know the details. He passed away a long time ago. Nothing else comes to mind, really. Mostly just the usual – arthritis, heart disease, that sort of thing. hic Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease, arthritis, and some breathing issues in the family. Now, just a few social questions, if you don't mind. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I detest smoking. My father smoked, and it was awful. I try to avoid being around people who smoke, honestly. hic It's disgusting, and unhealthy. I drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Not a big drinker. No other habits, really. I mostly just work, try to stay active, and spend time with my niece. hic And, currently, trying to get rid of these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no other habits. Alright, Ms. Redeye, everything sounds relatively normal. Persistent hiccups lasting this long are unusual, but not always a sign of something serious. Given your history, I suspect it could be related to some irritation of the diaphragm, perhaps from the lifting, the stress, or even the iced tea. However, to rule out anything more concerning, I'd like to order a chest x-ray and a blood test to check your electrolyte levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I want to know what’s going on, so I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. hic A chest x-ray and a blood test. Okay. Will the blood test be a lot? I'm not a fan of needles. And the x-ray… is it safe? hic I worry about radiation. Is it a lot of radiation?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable concern. The blood test is fairly standard - just a few vials drawn from your arm. As for the x-ray, the amount of radiation is very minimal, less than what you're exposed to on a cross-country flight. It's a quick scan and we take precautions to minimize exposure. We'll need to get those ordered for you. I'm going to write you a requisition for both, and the lab is just down the hall. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Not insured at all. hic I’ve been meaning to get some, but it’s expensive, and complicated. Will that be a problem? How much will the tests cost? hic I’m on a fixed income, and I don’t want a surprise bill. I just want to get rid of these hiccups, and I’m starting to worry about the cost now. hic I really didn't think it would come to this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Redeye, I understand. Being uninsured can certainly make things difficult. Let me see what options we have. The x-ray will be approximately $150, and the blood tests around $100. I can also see if the lab offers a discount for cash-paying patients. And, there are some local resources that may be able to assist with the cost of medical care. We can also discuss the potential risks and benefits of delaying the tests, although I would recommend getting them done to rule out anything serious. Would you like me to look into those resources for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… wonderful, actually. hic Looking into resources… that would be a huge help. I'm really starting to panic now, honestly. $250 is… a lot of money. And the thought of waiting… hic I just want to know what's wrong. hic If you could see what options there are, that would be amazing. Thank you, Doctor. hic You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see... Alright, it looks like there’s a program at the local hospital that offers financial assistance for uninsured patients. It requires some paperwork, but it could significantly reduce the cost. And the lab offers a 10% discount for cash-paying patients. That brings the total down to around $202. I can also provide you with the paperwork for the assistance program and help you fill it out if you’d like. While we wait, are there any other symptoms that you’ve noticed – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: hic Twenty-two dollars is much better. Thank you, Doctor. Really. And yes, helping me with the paperwork would be wonderful. I’m terrible with forms, honestly. hic Let me think… unrelated symptoms… well, my appetite hasn't been great the past few days. It’s not that I’m not hungry, I just don’t feel like eating much. And… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, even for me. But I just thought it was from the stress, and not sleeping well with the hic… hiccups. Everything else seems normal, I think. I just want these to stop. hic Is it possible they’ll just go away on their own?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Redeye. It’s possible they will resolve on their own, but given the duration, it's best to investigate. Loss of appetite and increased fatigue could be related, or could be separate issues. Here's the financial assistance application. It asks for some income verification, but we can go through it together. In the meantime, let's get the requisition for the x-ray and blood tests printed and you can head down to the lab. We'll get this sorted out. And to reiterate, I want to rule out anything serious, and then we can discuss management options. Is there anyone you’d like to contact while you wait?
PATIENT: hic Okay, thank you. I think I can manage the paperwork… with your help, of course. I really appreciate it, Doctor. And no, I don’t need to contact anyone. My niece is at work, and I don't want to worry her. hic She's always fretting over me. I'll just head down to the lab, then. Will they tell me the results right away? hic Or do I need to come back? I don't want to make another trip if I don't have to. hic And… is there anything I can do now, while I wait, to try and stop them? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: The lab results will take a little while – typically a few hours for the bloodwork, and the x-ray report can take up to 24 hours. They won’t be able to give you definitive results immediately, so you’ll need to come back for a follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that now. And as for things you can do now… try sipping on some ice water, small sips. And consciously trying to breathe slowly and deeply. It may not work, but it's worth a try. And I’ll write you a prescription for some antacids, just in case the hiccups are causing any discomfort. Here you go. Do you have any questions before you head down?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Antacids, ice water, slow breathing… I'll try all of that. hic Thank you so much, Doctor. Really. You've been very kind, and patient. I appreciate you taking the time to help me, and for looking into the financial assistance. I'll go down to the lab, then, and schedule the follow-up appointment when I come back. hic I’ll let you know how it goes. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I hope they subside before your appointment.
