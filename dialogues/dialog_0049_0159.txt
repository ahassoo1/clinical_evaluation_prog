DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's kinda weird. It's just... getting up from chairs. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's gettin' harder. Not painful, exactly, just… stuck, you know? Like my legs don't wanna listen right away.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. And it’s been a few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe four or five weeks now. Started kinda slow, just needed a little extra push. Now it feels like I gotta really work to get goin’. It's mostly when I've been sittin' for a bit, like at the diner after a shift or… well, anywhere, really. It doesn't happen when I'm standin' or walkin'.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So it’s positional… only when you’ve been sitting. And it's getting progressively worse. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this difficulty getting up?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not really. I get tired easy, but that's just the job, ya know? Oil work's hard on a guy. No numbness, no pain shootin' down my legs, nothin' like that. Just… the legs feel heavy when I go to stand. And I've been kinda clumsy lately, bumped into a few things, but I figured I was just not payin' attention.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness… okay. And you said the fatigue is likely work-related?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Long hours, heavy lifting, the usual. Though, now that you mention it, maybe it's a little worse than usual this past month. Not enough to worry about, I figured. Just… worn out. I didn't really connect it to the legs, honestly. It's just kinda how it is, you know? But maybe... maybe they are connected.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some basics, just to be thorough. Any past medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I busted my arm pretty bad when I was a kid, fell outta a tree. But it healed up fine, never bothered me since. Other than that, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Just the usual colds and flu, nothin' serious. Oh, and… my wife, bless her, she passed away last year. But that was… well, that wasn't a medical thing.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Fratoni. It's important to note everything. And no other significant medical history?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing I can think of. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothin'. I eat okay, mostly diner food, not the healthiest, I admit. But I try to get enough sleep when I can. And I don't smoke or drink much, just a beer with the boys sometimes after a long shift. Honestly, I’m usually pretty tough, so this leg thing is kinda throwin' me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… neurological problems?
PATIENT: Neurological problems… huh. That's a tough one. My grandma on my mom's side… she got kinda shaky when she got really old, but I always figured that was just old age. And my uncle, he had some kinda trouble with his balance, but I don't know what it was. He didn't really talk about it. No one ever really talked about medical stuff much in my family, to be honest. It was just kinda… you dealt with it, or you didn't. So, I'm not sure if that helps. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Fratoni. It’s common for families not to discuss medical histories in detail. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it. Just coffee, lots and lots of coffee to get through the shifts. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's about it. Pretty much a clean slate there, Doctor. I've always been lucky enough to not need much medicine, until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what I gotta do. I'm not a fan of hospitals, but I understand you gotta check things out. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, if you could just sit here on the edge of the table. Then I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. Just relax, and I'll do the rest. Now, just let your legs dangle freely.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Just let me know if I gotta do anything. I'm a little nervous, not gonna lie. My legs feel kinda heavy already, just sittin' here. Hopefully it's nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes are… somewhat diminished bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you push down on my hands with both of your feet, as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I'll try my best. Like this? It feels kinda awkward pushin' against your hands. Should I push harder? I don't wanna hurt you. It’s a little hard, though, to be honest. My legs feel… like they're workin' overtime just holdin' me up.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Now, relax for a moment. Your strength is… slightly reduced in both legs, and there's some noted effort. Lastly, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger, and repeat that a few times?
PATIENT: Okay, sure thing. Like this? It feels a little… off. I'm usually pretty coordinated, but my hand feels kinda clumsy. I think I'm gettin' worse, Doctor. It's kinda scary, to be honest. My legs are feelin' heavier now, and my hand keeps missin' your finger.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There's some noted dyscoordination, and a slight tremor in your hand. Alright, that’s enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, your symptoms – the difficulty getting up, the fatigue, the clumsiness, and the diminished reflexes and strength – are concerning. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, including a neurological issue or a muscular weakness. I’m going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and other potential causes. I also recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any structural problems. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wow. MRI… neurological issue… that sounds… serious. I don't even know what all that means, Doctor. Is this… is this gonna take a long time? And… is this somethin' bad? I just wanna get back to work, you know? And I don’t have insurance, so… how much is all this gonna cost? I'm kinda overwhelmed. I didn't expect any of this when I just came in 'cause I couldn't get outta a chair.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Fratoni. It is a lot to take in. Let's break it down. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your spine. It’s not necessarily a sign of something bad, just a tool to help us diagnose the problem accurately. As for the costs, I know you mentioned not having insurance. The lab work is relatively inexpensive, but the MRI can be quite costly. We can explore options like a payment plan or see if there are any financial assistance programs available at the hospital. My staff will help you with that. As for a timeline, the lab results should be back within a few days, and we can schedule the MRI as soon as possible. We will need to see a neurologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. I’m going to write a referral order now. I want to be upfront with you: until we have a clearer understanding of what's causing these symptoms, I would advise against strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. It's important to protect yourself until we know what we're dealing with. Do you have any other concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Okay… payment plan would be good. I really appreciate that. And a neurologist… I guess that's gotta happen. No strenuous activity… that's gonna be tough. That's kinda my whole life, you know? But I guess I gotta do what I gotta do. Just… what are we lookin' for, exactly? Like, what could it be? Is this somethin' that could… you know… could I not be able to work anymore? I'm sorry, it’s just… my wife… she needed me to work. And now… I don’t even know. I’m kinda scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Mr. Fratoni. It's natural to be worried when facing the unknown. Let me be clear: it’s too early to jump to any conclusions. There are many possible causes for your symptoms, ranging from relatively minor issues like vitamin deficiencies to more serious conditions affecting your nerves or muscles. The neurologist will conduct a thorough examination and review the MRI results to determine the exact cause. Some possibilities we'll be considering include neuropathy , myopathy , or even a spinal cord issue. However, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need more information before we can say anything definitively. It's unlikely that you won't be able to work at all, but it's possible that your work duties may need to be adjusted depending on the diagnosis. We'll work together to find a solution that allows you to stay as active and healthy as possible. My staff will provide you with a list of neurologists who accept your case and can help schedule an appointment. We’ll also explore resources for financial assistance and potential disability benefits if needed. You're not alone in this, Mr. Fratoni, and we'll do everything we can to help you get the answers and treatment you need. Let me finish this referral order, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions before I do?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything really well. I still feel scared, but… at least I know what we're lookin' for. Just… please let my staff know I need help with the paperwork. I'm not good with all that stuff. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen, Doctor. Really. It's just… it's hard losin' someone and then feelin' like somethin's wrong with you. It's a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Fratoni. My staff is fully aware of your situation and will gladly assist you with all the paperwork and financial assistance applications. They are excellent at navigating these processes, so you don't need to worry. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious when facing new health challenges. It's okay to ask for help, and we are here to support you every step of the way. Take your time, and don’t rush into anything. The most important thing is to focus on getting the answers you need and taking care of yourself. I wish you all the best, Mr. Fratoni. We will be in touch to follow up on your progress. And please, if your symptoms worsen at any time, don’t hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room.
