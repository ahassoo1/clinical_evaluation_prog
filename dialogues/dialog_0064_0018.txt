DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather a lot. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn’t have bothered coming in, but it’s… disruptive. I find myself needing to go quite frequently, even at night. I’m not sure when it started, exactly. Time does seem to slip away these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. It's good you came in. It’s never embarrassing to discuss these things – it’s important to get to the bottom of it. Disruptive to your sleep is definitely something we want to address. You mentioned "rather a lot" and "frequently". Could you try to give me a sense of how often you're going?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s difficult. Let me think. During the day, I’d say… every couple of hours, perhaps? It’s not constant, but close to it. And at night… oh dear. Two, maybe three times. It’s… unsettling. I don't recall ever having this much trouble before. I usually have a good night’s sleep, but recently… not so much. It's hard to say exactly, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a couple of times during the day and two or three times at night. That is a change from your usual pattern. And you’re right to mention it’s affecting your sleep. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you go to the bathroom, do you feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you still need to go shortly afterwards?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think I do empty it, yes. I don’t feel like there’s much left, if that makes sense. But then, a short while later, the urge returns. It’s not a painful urge, just… persistent. It’s rather peculiar, really. I don't recall ever feeling this way before. Is it… something to worry about? I do try to drink a reasonable amount of water, but I enjoy a cup of tea with my evening meal, and perhaps that contributes? I’m really not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling like you empty your bladder, but the urge returns soon after. Not painful, just persistent. That's helpful. And you're wondering if the evening tea might be a factor. It's possible, yes, caffeine can sometimes have that effect. Let's talk about other things you might be drinking or eating. Besides tea, what other fluids do you typically consume in a day?
PATIENT: Well, mostly water, as I said. I do enjoy a glass of juice with my breakfast sometimes, orange juice usually. And perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on occasion, though not every night. I don’t drink soda, I don’t care for it. I try to eat a balanced diet, fruits and vegetables mostly. Not much in the way of sweets, I suppose. I really couldn’t say that anything specific is causing this. It’s just… appeared. I do hope it isn’t something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, so water, occasional orange juice and wine, balanced diet. That doesn't immediately point to anything obvious. Now, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Hmm. That’s a… specific question. Let me think. I suppose it looks normal. You know, the usual color. Not cloudy, not particularly dark or light. I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully. I can’t say I’ve been examining it closely, if you understand my meaning. It just… goes where it’s supposed to, looking… ordinary. I really haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn't have to examine it closely! I just ask because changes in color or clarity can sometimes be helpful. Since you haven’t noticed anything unusual, that’s good. Now, have you experienced any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain, no burning. It's a perfectly normal… flow, as far as I can tell. It’s just the frequency that’s bothering me. And the disruption to my sleep, of course. It’s… unsettling, to be woken up multiple times in the night. I suppose it could be worse, but it’s… inconvenient. I really wish I knew what was causing it. Is it possible it’s just… age? Perhaps my bladder isn’t as strong as it used to be?
DOCTOR: It could be related to age, Mr. Verbos, and a slight weakening of the bladder muscles is common as we get older. However, we want to rule out other possibilities first. Now, I’m going to ask you about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was normal then, as far as I recall. I had a bout of high blood pressure a while ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Otherwise… I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I try to stay active, enjoy a bit of gardening. Nothing major, nothing serious. I really don't recall any other diagnoses. My memory, you see… it’s not what it used to be. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps a list would help me remember?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Verbos. Knowing about the high blood pressure and the normal prostate check is good. And don't worry about the memory – we'll take our time. No need for a list right now. Let’s move on to medications. What medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medications. Let me see… I take a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, as I mentioned. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to keep things topped up, you know? Nothing else, I don’t think. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, I prefer a natural approach whenever possible. I believe a good diet and a bit of exercise are the best medicine. I really can’t recall any other medications. Is that all you need to know for now?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verbos. Just the lisinopril and multivitamin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a simple neurological check. It will help me to get a better understanding of your situation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. A physical exam is a good idea. I'm not opposed to it at all. Please, proceed whenever you're ready. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I do have a bit of gardening planned for this afternoon, if the weather holds. But health comes first, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t take long, Mr. Verbos. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Alright, everything sounds normal there. No obvious signs of anything concerning. Your reflexes are good, and sensation is normal as well. Good. Now, I’d like to check your prostate, if you don’t mind. It's a quick and standard procedure to rule out any issues.
PATIENT: Yes, all right. A prostate check. I suppose it's best to be thorough. I had it checked a few years back, as I mentioned, and everything was normal then. But I understand the importance of repeating the procedure. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, if you would be so kind. It's not my favourite procedure, you understand. But health comes first, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp discomfort. Okay, everything feels normal there as well. The prostate feels smooth and unremarkable. No obvious signs of enlargement or tenderness. Alright, Mr. Verbos. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it sounds like we’re dealing with a case of increased urinary frequency, likely related to age and possibly a bit of bladder sensitivity. However, to be completely sure and rule out other possibilities like a urinary tract infection, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A urine analysis and a metabolic panel… to rule everything out. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’d be happy to have those tests done. Anything that will put my mind at ease, you know? I’m not overly concerned, but it’s always best to be sure. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast for the metabolic panel? I do enjoy my breakfast, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for the metabolic panel – no food or drinks after midnight tonight. Just water is fine. As for the results, the urine analysis should be back within a day or two, and the metabolic panel usually takes a bit longer, maybe three to five business days. Our lab will contact you directly with the results, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them together. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your fluid intake before bedtime, especially caffeinated beverages and alcohol. We can also explore some bladder training exercises, which can help to strengthen your bladder muscles and reduce the frequency. Would you be interested in learning more about those?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Bladder training exercises… that sounds like a good idea. Anything that might help. Limiting fluids before bedtime and avoiding caffeine… I can certainly manage that. I’ll try to stick to water in the evenings. And I’ll be happy to learn about the exercises. Perhaps a handout with instructions? I’m not the most tech-savvy, you see. I prefer something I can write notes on. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing we’re taking steps to address the problem.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a handout with instructions on bladder training exercises. It explains the basic techniques and provides a schedule for gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. It also has space for you to jot down your progress. We’ll also send a requisition form to the lab for the urine analysis and metabolic panel. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist when you’re ready to discuss the results. If you experience any pain, fever, or blood in your urine before your follow-up appointment, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions and explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I feel much more at ease now, and I’m confident we’re on the right track. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment with the receptionist as soon as I leave. And I’ll be sure to follow your instructions regarding the fluids and exercises. Thank you again for your help, Doctor Smetak. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was my pleasure. Remember, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your gardening! .
