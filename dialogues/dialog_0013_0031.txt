DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen, and… I have a heart thing, I think. The doctors told me it’s called… atrial… something. It makes my heart beat funny sometimes. That’s why I’m here, about the leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thanks for letting me know. Swelling in one leg and a history of atrial… sounds like atrial fibrillation, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Atrial fibrillation. It’s been… diagnosed for a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long, truthfully. But the swelling… that’s new, or at least much worse than it usually is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first notice the increased swelling in your left leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit bigger than usual, and I thought it was just from walking too much, perhaps. But it’s gotten worse each day since then. It’s quite noticeable now, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening. And is it painful?
PATIENT: It’s not… terribly painful, no. More… heavy, and achy, if that makes sense? Like a constant dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. And warm, to the touch. I haven’t really been able to put my feet up, being so busy, so I thought maybe that’s contributing.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy, achy, warm to the touch. No sharp pain. And you haven’t been able to elevate it much. Have you noticed any redness or skin changes besides warmth?
PATIENT: No, not really. The skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little paler than my other leg, but I always have trouble telling with my own legs. It's just… swollen and warm. And a bit uncomfortable, naturally. I haven’t noticed any cuts or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness, cuts, or skin changes, just swelling and warmth. I’m going to take a look at your leg now, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do. I’m quite eager to find out what’s going on. It’s just… worrying, you see. Especially with the heart condition.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. I’m feeling your pulses now, and they feel a little weaker on your left side compared to your right. I’m also pressing on your leg here… yes, there’s definite pitting edema – meaning it holds the indentation when I press on it. The leg does feel warmer than your right leg. No obvious redness or skin breakdown. It doesn't appear acutely thrombotic, but we need to rule that out. Do you have a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear. No, not that I’m aware of. No, I haven’t been told I’ve ever had one. I… I suppose I don’t really ask about those things. I just go to the doctor when something hurts, you see. I don’t usually… preemptively inquire about clots. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It’s not bad at all, a lot of people feel the same way. It’s good you’re here now. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the new swelling, we need to rule out a blood clot in your leg – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s a possibility, and atrial fibrillation can increase the risk. We’ll do an ultrasound to check for that. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… serious. A blood clot. Goodness. No, I don’t have any allergies, as far as I know. And I’m not taking any medications currently. I haven’t needed anything, thankfully. Just… the usual over-the-counter things for a headache now and then. Is an ultrasound… painful? And what will it show exactly? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just get a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Nixon. It’s good to ask questions, especially when you’re anxious. An ultrasound isn't painful at all. It uses sound waves, so it's completely non-invasive. We'll put some gel on your leg and move a probe over it. It will show us the veins in your leg and whether there's a blood clot present. I'm going to order that ultrasound now. While we're waiting, let's talk a bit more about your heart condition. Who is your cardiologist?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s reassuring about the ultrasound. Not painful is good. As for my cardiologist… let me think. It’s Doctor… MacIntyre. Yes, Doctor MacIntyre at the… the city hospital. I haven’t seen him in… quite a while, I must admit. I mostly just take the pills he prescribed and try to avoid getting too flustered. I suppose I should be more proactive. Is that what you’re thinking?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nixon, staying in touch with your cardiologist is a good idea. We’ll want to make sure your atrial fibrillation is well-managed. And it's helpful to know what medication you're on. Do you remember the name of the medication Doctor MacIntyre prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I have the box somewhere, but I haven’t looked at it in ages. It’s a little white pill… and I think it has a number on it? Something like… 25? Or maybe 50? I’m truly terrible with names and numbers, I apologize. It’s for the heart, that much I know. And it makes me feel a bit… tired sometimes, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill, possibly with 25 or 50 on it, and makes you feel tired. That sounds like it could be metoprolol, or possibly bisoprolol, both common medications for atrial fibrillation. We can confirm with Doctor MacIntyre’s office. Okay, Nixon, the nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood for a D-dimer test, which can also help rule out a blood clot. While we're waiting for the ultrasound and lab results, I'm going to recommend you elevate your left leg as much as possible and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Any questions about that?
PATIENT: Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. I suppose I’ve been neglecting that, to be honest. Prolonged standing… well, my job does require a bit of that. But I’ll try my best. A D-dimer test… is that also painful? And will it take long to get the results? I’m terribly sorry for asking so many questions, Doctor. I just… I’m a bit worried, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: No, Nixon, no apologies necessary at all. It’s perfectly okay to be worried, and asking questions is the best thing you can do. The D-dimer test is just a simple blood draw – a quick pinch, and then it’s done. It usually takes a few hours to get the results back. We’ll have a better idea of what’s going on once we have those results and the ultrasound findings. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or increased pain or swelling in your leg, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have someone who could take you to the ER if needed?
PATIENT: Oh, a few hours… that’s manageable. And no, I don’t… I live alone, Doctor. I don’t have anyone who could take me, no. But I suppose I could call an ambulance if it came to that. That’s… reassuring to know, at least. Sudden chest pain… that sounds frightening. I’ll be very mindful of that, I assure you. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It's my job. And don't hesitate to call 911 if you experience any concerning symptoms. The nurse will be in shortly. We'll figure this out together.
