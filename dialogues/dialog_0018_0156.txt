DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach. It's been… not good, lately. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's just… persistent, you know? I think it's something to do with my… insides, I guess? I remember the doctor mentioning something about… well, something I can't eat properly, a long time ago. I don't really remember much else, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. Persistent diarrhea, you say. And you recall a previous doctor mentioning something related to difficulty eating properly?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. It was… a while ago, when I was younger, I think. They did some tests, and… something came up. It wasn't anything serious, I don't think, but they told me to avoid some foods. I just… I can't really remember which foods. It's frustrating, because I keep having to run to the bathroom, and it’s really tiring. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the specifics; that's what we're here to figure out. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. To start, could you tell me roughly how long this current episode of diarrhea has been lasting?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like… weeks, maybe? A few weeks, at least. It comes and goes, but it's always there, sort of. Like, some days are worse than others, but it hasn't really stopped for a long time. I think it started getting really bad around… July, maybe? I'm not very good with dates, sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Jase. Several weeks, starting around July. And would you describe the diarrhea as watery, or more formed?
PATIENT: Definitely watery. Like… really watery. It’s not… solid, at all. And sometimes… sometimes there's blood. Just a little, but it’s there. I’m sorry, that’s probably… gross. It’s just… been happening a lot lately, and it’s worrying me. I’ve been trying to drink a lot of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jase. It’s good you're staying hydrated. And it’s important you told me about the blood; that’s something we need to investigate further. Now, regarding your diet – have you noticed any specific foods that seem to worsen the diarrhea, or any that seem to improve it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s hard. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. I eat pretty much the same things as always. I like… rice and chicken, mostly. And vegetables. I don’t think any particular food makes it worse, but I haven’t been experimenting or anything. I just try to avoid anything too spicy, because that definitely doesn’t help. Does that make sense? I feel bad because I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jase. You're doing fine. It's alright not to have all the answers. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. I’ve been really tired lately. More tired than usual, even for me. And… my stomach hurts a lot. It's not like a sharp pain, more of a… cramping feeling. And I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t weighed myself, but… yeah. Oh! And I feel bloated, too. Like, really full and uncomfortable. Sorry, I'm just trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Jase. That’s a lot of helpful information. Fatigue, abdominal cramping, weight loss, and bloating – these are all important things to note. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I haven’t taken any medications lately, except for… painkillers, sometimes, for a headache. But that’s it. And I don't have any other… conditions, I don't think. Like I said, I remember the doctor mentioning something when I was younger, but I can't recall what it was. I'm so sorry I'm not being more helpful. It’s just… my memory isn't very good.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. We'll do our best to piece things together. No known allergies, and you've only been taking painkillers for headaches. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – for example, digestive issues, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mum… she had some stomach problems when she was younger, I think. She used to get really bad cramps, but I don’t know what it was. And my uncle… he had something with his… intestines, maybe? He was always in and out of hospital, but I don't remember the details. My dad is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. It’s hard to say, really. We don’t really talk about medical things much in my family. I’m sorry. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Jase. History of stomach problems in your mother and an intestinal issue in your uncle – we’ll keep that in mind. Finally, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any drugs. I don’t really go out much, to be honest. I mostly just stay at home with my husband. I'm a bit of a homebody.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Now, let's see… I see some notes from when you were 10 years old regarding recurrent abdominal pain and testing for celiac disease. The results were inconclusive at that time, but dietary adjustments were recommended. It seems a follow-up wasn’t documented. Given your current symptoms and the previous history, I’d like to conduct a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. If it helps, then yes. I… I guess it makes sense to check things, doesn’t it? I don’t remember much about the tests when I was younger, but… if it could be something to do with that, then yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m listening for bowel sounds. They seem a bit… hyperactive, which can be associated with diarrhea. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That's a bit sore. Not awful, but… yeah, definitely tender there. Everything else feels okay, I think. Just that spot on the left side. It’s a bit of a cramping pain when you press on it. It’s not constant, but… yeah. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. You’re doing fine. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant is noted. There is no guarding or rebound tenderness. Now I’m going to check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 88, and temperature is 98.6. Finally, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. Okay. Based on the physical exam and your history, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. Given the history of abdominal pain as a child, inconclusive testing for celiac disease, the tenderness in your lower left quadrant, and the persistent diarrhea, I’m leaning towards further investigation of possible inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, other causes of diarrhea also need to be ruled out, such as infectious causes or medication side effects. I'd like to order some blood tests, a stool sample analysis to check for infection, and a colonoscopy to visualize your colon and take biopsies. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds… scary. I don't really like the sound of that at all. But… if it's important, then yes, I guess. I just… I'm worried about what they might find. And what if it is something bad? But… if it helps figure out what's wrong, then yes. Blood tests and the… the stool sample, that’s fine. The colonoscopy… I'm a bit nervous, but yes. If you think it's necessary. Could you tell me a bit more about it? What does it involve? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Jase. A colonoscopy can sound intimidating, but it's a very important diagnostic tool. Let me explain the procedure in detail and address your concerns. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum and advancing it through your colon. This allows us to visualize the lining of your colon and identify any abnormalities, such as inflammation, ulcers, or polyps. We can also take small tissue samples for further examination under a microscope. Before the procedure, you'll need to thoroughly cleanse your colon to ensure a clear view. This involves following a special diet and taking a bowel preparation medication, which can be unpleasant but is essential for accurate results. During the procedure, you’ll be sedated to minimize discomfort and anxiety. Most patients don’t feel any pain during the colonoscopy, though you may experience some bloating or cramping. After the procedure, you may have some mild bloating or gas, but these symptoms usually resolve quickly. The procedure is performed by a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive health. They will explain the risks and benefits in detail before you sign a consent form. As for the risks, they are relatively rare but can include bleeding or perforation of the colon. However, these complications are uncommon, and the gastroenterologist will take precautions to minimize them. I will provide you with detailed written instructions about the bowel preparation and the procedure itself. I also want to assure you that I will be here to answer any questions or concerns you may have throughout the process. Would you like me to schedule the colonoscopy and blood tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. If you think it's the best thing to do, then yes. Schedule them. I'd like to get this sorted out, even if it is a bit scary. And… thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It makes me feel a bit better, knowing what to expect. Could… could you schedule the blood tests first, maybe? I think I'd prefer to do those before the colonoscopy. If that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. That’s perfectly reasonable. We can definitely schedule the blood tests first. Alright, I’ve scheduled you for blood work at the clinic lab on August 7th at 9:00 AM. You don’t need a separate appointment; just check in at the lab desk. The results should be available in about a week. Once we have those results, we can schedule the colonoscopy. In the meantime, it’s important to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, high fever, or bloody stools, please contact me immediately. I will also give you a handout detailing the bowel preparation instructions for the colonoscopy. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a bit less anxious, knowing what's going to happen. I'll… I’ll see you after the blood tests, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could ease your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you after the blood tests. Have a good day.
