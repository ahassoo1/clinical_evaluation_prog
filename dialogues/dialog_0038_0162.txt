DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for this, but my stomach’s been… puffy. Bloated. It’s annoying, alright? Just want something to fix it and get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy and just want to get this sorted. “Puffy” and “bloated” are helpful, but could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about what? It swells up, okay? Like after a big meal. Sometimes even if it’s not that big. It just… feels full of air, I guess. Look, I eat normal stuff. Burgers, pasta, you know. It’s not like I’m on some fancy diet or anything. It just happens. Honestly, I don't know what you want me to tell you.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So it swells up, feels full of air, and happens even with normal-sized meals. And it's not consistently after every meal, is that correct?
PATIENT: No, not every meal. Sometimes I don't even notice it. Other times it’s… bad. Really uncomfortable. Look, does it matter? It’s a stomach. It gets big sometimes. Can you just give me something for it? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. It’s good you’re able to describe when it happens and doesn’t. It does matter a little, as there are a few different things that can cause bloating, and knowing the pattern helps me figure out the best course of action. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if anything makes it better?
PATIENT: Better? Ugh. Laying down, maybe? I don’t know. Honestly, it usually just goes away on its own after a while. I just… deal with it. I don't spend a lot of time analyzing my stomach, alright? I got things to do. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, so laying down sometimes helps, and it usually resolves on its own. I appreciate you telling me that. It won't take long, but I do need to ask a few more questions to make sure we’re not missing anything. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like… pain? Sometimes, yeah. A little cramping. Nothing major. It’s a stomach. It makes noises, it gets uncomfortable. What else would there be? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I just tell you when it feels bad. Don't need a whole interrogation about it. Is this about the noises? Because everyone's stomach makes noises.
DOCTOR: No, not specifically about the noises, although it's good to know your stomach does make them. I just want to get a full picture. You mentioned cramping. Is that cramping consistent with the bloating, or does it happen separately?
PATIENT: It usually happens with the bloating. Like, when it gets puffy, then I get a little… twisty feeling inside. Not bad enough to go to the hospital or anything, just… annoying. I don’t even know why I’m telling you this. Honestly, it's probably just something I ate. Can we just skip to the fix already? I’ve got a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bloating and cramping together, and it seems to come and go. And you suspect it's related to something you’ve eaten. Just to be sure, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Bowel… Look, are you asking me if I’ve been going to the bathroom alright? Really? Is that what this is about? I don't discuss these things with strangers. It’s all connected, isn't it? Everything’s always connected. Fine. Sometimes I feel… backed up. Happy now? Can we please just get this over with? This is ridiculous. I feel like I’m in an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. It's helpful to know about the constipation. And I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, that's not my intention. I just need to rule some things out. Before we talk about a fix, I'd like to quickly ask about any past medical history, any surgeries you've had, or if anyone in your family has similar issues. That information helps me understand if there might be something else going on.
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history? Seriously? Look, my wife… she passed away a few years back. Cancer. That’s all you need to know. I don’t remember details. Surgeries? No. Never had anything major done. I work with my hands, I’m healthy. Healthy enough. I don’t have time for this, alright? I'm getting a headache. Just... can't you just give me something for the bloating? Anything? I'll take anything at this point. Let's just skip the whole family history bit, alright? It's depressing.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Kristofik. That must have been incredibly difficult. And I understand you’re not wanting to delve into family history right now, that's perfectly alright. Given what you've told me – the bloating, cramping, constipation, and no significant medical history – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome , or possibly just some dietary sensitivities. However, because of your wife’s cancer, and the constipation symptom, I want to be cautious. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything unusual. It'll only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got stuff to do. Don't poke too hard. And hurry, alright? I'm already late. This is wasting my time. I really hate doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening now. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. There's no tenderness when I press, which is good. I'm just checking everything out. Now, to be on the safe side, given the constipation symptom and your wife’s history, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your iron levels and rule out any underlying inflammation. And I'd also recommend a stool test to check for any hidden blood. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood test, stool test… More tests. Wonderful. Look, I really don't like needles, alright? And I don’t want to think about… that other thing. Is it absolutely necessary? Seriously? I just want something for the bloating, not a whole medical workup. Fine. If it gets me out of here faster, do the tests. But hurry. I have a deadline. And tell the person doing the… stool test to be gentle. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The tests are just to be cautious, given your wife’s history and the constipation. It's better to rule things out. While we wait for the results – which should be back in a few days – I can recommend an over-the-counter medication to help with the bloating and gas. Something containing simethicone. And I’d suggest trying to increase your fiber intake gradually, and drinking plenty of water. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about IBS, and some dietary tips. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Simethicone. Fiber. Water. Sounds… boring. Just give me the stuff. I'll… try it, I guess. I don't make promises. And just… keep it brief, alright? I really need to get back to work. This has been a waste of time. Honestly. Just… where do I get this handout and the stuff? Can I just go? I got things to do. A deadline, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. The simethicone is available over-the-counter at any pharmacy. The handout explains the dietary changes and information about IBS in more detail. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and give you the instructions for the stool sample before you leave. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they get worse, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. I understand you're busy, and I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… get me out of here. Thank you. I guess. Just… I need to go. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. The nurse will be with you shortly. I hope you feel better soon, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, despite everything. .
