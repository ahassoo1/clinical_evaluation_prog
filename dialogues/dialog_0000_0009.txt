DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, so you’re here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Batara, it’s my sight, naturally. It’s…diminishing. Not all at once, you understand, but steadily. It’s quite inconvenient, really. Makes reading the reports at work…difficult. I do try to stay on top of things, but it's hard when you can’t clearly see the things you need to.
DOCTOR: "Diminishing," you say. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's been... gradual. Perhaps six months, maybe a bit longer? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, assumed it was just fatigue, working long hours, you know. It’s only recently become…noticeable. Enough to be a genuine problem, that is. I wouldn’t bother a doctor for a minor inconvenience, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you say it’s interfering with your work reports now?
PATIENT: Precisely. The smaller print, particularly. The forms, the summaries… they’re becoming quite blurry. I find myself straining, holding things closer and closer. It’s…undignified, frankly. And I’ve always prided myself on attention to detail. One can’t very well be a successful Human Resources Assistant if one can’t see the important details, can one? It’s a matter of professional competence, really.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… now that you mention it, sometimes I think my vision… fluctuates. Not constantly, mind you. But there are moments where it seems clearer, and others where it's…more clouded. It’s rather irregular. And, come to think of it, I have been experiencing a bit more… eye strain, I suppose. But I attribute that to the computer screen, naturally. We spend all day looking at those things. It's bound to cause some discomfort. I wouldn’t necessarily call it a ‘symptom’ though, Doctor. More of an occupational hazard, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Fluctuating vision and eye strain. Occupational hazard, you say. Alright. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Have for…oh, twenty years or so, I suppose. Mild prescription, nothing dramatic. Just for distance, really. I can still see perfectly well up close—could see perfectly well, that is, before this recent…deterioration. I haven't needed to adjust them in years, though. The optician always says they're fine, perfectly adequate. Perhaps it's time for a new check-up, come to think of it. Though I doubt they would be of much assistance. These things seem… different. Not simply a matter of needing a stronger lens, you understand.
DOCTOR: And when was your last eye exam?
PATIENT: Let me see… goodness. It's been a while, truthfully. Probably… two, maybe three years ago? It slipped my mind. Routine check-up, nothing unusual. They assured me everything was perfectly normal. I tend to put these things off, you know. A bit of a…procrastinator, I suppose. As long as I can see well enough to perform my duties, I don’t see the need to bother with unnecessary appointments. Though clearly, that strategy isn't working out as planned. I apologize for the lapse in preventative care, Doctor. It’s just… life gets busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension several years ago, but it’s well-controlled with diet and exercise. I’m quite diligent about my health, you know. I watch my sodium intake, I get regular walks… I'm not one to let myself go, Doctor. Aside from that… no. Nothing significant. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing of that nature. I’ve always been a rather healthy specimen, if I may say so myself. Though this… vision issue is rather perplexing. It doesn’t seem to fit any of the usual patterns, does it?
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a low dose of lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible, you understand. Nature provides all the remedies one needs, in my opinion. I take a daily multivitamin, and I'm fond of herbal teas. But that’s about it. Nothing that would, conceivably, affect my eyesight. I’ve never been one for pills and potions, Doctor. Prefer a natural approach to wellness, if you follow me. I wouldn’t want to introduce any unnecessary variables into the equation, that’s certain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not to medications, no. Dust, perhaps. A bit of seasonal pollen, but nothing severe. I don’t require any special accommodations, if that’s what you’re asking. A mild sniffle here and there, but nothing that would impact my…visual acuity. I haven't had a serious allergic reaction in years, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. It's served me well, I believe. Though it clearly isn't preventing this…decline in sight. Which, frankly, is rather disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s do a quick examination. I'm going to check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examine your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Just follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall do my best. Though, if I may say so, I find these examinations rather…uncomfortable. Straining my eyes to decipher those minuscule letters… It’s hardly conducive to accurate results, is it? But, I understand it’s necessary. Proceed, then. I'll attempt to cooperate, despite my reservations. Just try to be gentle, if you would. And please, avoid shining bright lights directly into my eyes. It’s quite jarring, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cover your left eye with your hand. Can you read the smallest line you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Hm. This is…difficult. The letters seem rather blurred. I can make out the larger ones, certainly. But the smaller lines… I believe I can see… perhaps the line above the bottom one? But it's quite indistinct. I hesitate to guess, as I don’t wish to provide inaccurate information. It's blurry, Doctor. Quite blurry. And, if I may say so, the lighting in here isn't particularly helpful. It seems to exacerbate the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, cover your right eye. And tell me what you can see on the chart.
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… considerably worse. I strain my eyes, attempting to decipher the letters, but they remain stubbornly blurred. I can barely make out the largest ones, let alone any of the smaller lines. It’s… quite distressing, actually. I don’t wish to exaggerate, but my vision seems significantly impaired in this eye. I can perhaps…discern a vague shape here and there, but nothing remotely resembling letters. It’s almost as if I’m looking through a fog, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Look straight ahead. Can you tell me when you first see my hand when it comes into your peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Hm. I can see… a vague movement to my left. A shadowy form, perhaps? It’s…difficult to pinpoint precisely. It’s not a clear, distinct image, you understand. More of a…peripheral awareness. It’s… rather subtle, Doctor. I hesitate to say when I first see it, as it’s not a dramatic appearance. It's more of a gradual awareness, slowly coming into focus. It seems… somewhat limited, if I may say so. Not as clear as it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’m going to shine a light into your eyes. Just look straight ahead. This won't be comfortable, but it's necessary. Hm. I see some mild optic disc pallor bilaterally and slight narrowing of the retinal vessels. No obvious hemorrhages or exudates. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Based on what I've seen, it appears you have some degree of optic neuropathy. Your visual acuity is reduced, your peripheral vision is slightly constricted, and the exam reveals changes in the optic nerve. It’s not an emergency, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Optic…neuropathy? That sounds… rather ominous, Doctor. Is that… serious? Will I go blind? I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of medical terminology. Could you perhaps… explain that in layman's terms? And what sort of “further investigation” are we talking about? Blood tests? Scans? I was rather hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps a new pair of glasses, not… a complicated diagnosis. I pride myself on being a pragmatic individual, Doctor, but this… this is unsettling. I trust you’ll assure me this isn’t something… untreatable, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Optic neuropathy simply means there’s damage to the optic nerve, which is the nerve that carries visual information from your eye to your brain. It can cause a gradual loss of vision. It’s not necessarily untreatable, but it is something we need to take seriously. The cause could be many things - high blood pressure, diabetes, even certain autoimmune conditions. We need to determine the underlying cause to start the right treatment. I’m going to order a few tests. First, a comprehensive blood work-up to check your blood sugar, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I also want to schedule you for a visual field test to map out your peripheral vision more accurately. And most importantly, I want you to see a neurologist for a brain MRI to rule out any central nervous system involvement. It’s important to catch this early and manage any underlying conditions. We don’t know the exact cause yet, so we need to gather more information. Don't jump to conclusions, alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a visual field test… and a neurologist? That sounds…extensive, Doctor. And rather expensive, I imagine. I am not currently insured, as you know. Will these tests be… prohibitively costly? And what sort of time commitment are we talking about? I have responsibilities, you understand. Work… commitments. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor, truly. But I must confess, this is rather daunting. Very well. Order the tests, then. But please, provide me with an estimated cost beforehand. And perhaps… a referral to a neurologist who accepts… a reasonable payment plan? I trust you understand my concerns, Doctor. A pragmatic approach, if you will.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns. I will have my staff provide you with estimated costs for each test, and we will find a neurologist who works with patients who have financial constraints. I’ll also have them look into any available assistance programs that might help cover some of the costs. I’ll write you a referral for a neurologist specializing in optic neuropathy, Dr. Anya Sharma at City General. She’s highly recommended and I believe she’ll work with you to develop a manageable plan. In the meantime, it’s important to monitor your vision closely. If you notice any sudden changes - blurred vision, double vision, loss of color vision - go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll also prescribe you a multivitamin with antioxidants, as they can be beneficial for optic nerve health. And please, continue to manage your blood pressure. Here's a printout with information about the tests, the referral, and some resources for financial assistance. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma at City General… I shall look into that. And thank you for the information regarding financial assistance. It is…appreciated. Multivitamins… and continued blood pressure management. I do those things already, as you know. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any dietary restrictions? Special exercises? I am a practical individual, Doctor. I prefer concrete actions, tangible steps. And, if I may ask, what is the…prognosis, generally speaking? What percentage of patients experience… significant vision loss? I understand you can’t predict the future, of course. But a general estimate would be…reassuring. And, finally… is this condition… hereditary? Should I be informing my family? Thank you, Doctor. For your time… and your…thoroughness. Perhaps we should schedule a follow-up appointment… once I’ve had the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns. As for additional steps, maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables is always beneficial. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, if applicable. There are no specific exercises that will directly improve your condition, but regular moderate exercise is good for your overall health. As for the prognosis, it's difficult to say definitively. The outcome depends heavily on the underlying cause and how quickly we can identify and treat it. In many cases, we can slow or even halt the progression of vision loss. However, some patients do experience significant vision loss despite treatment. I don't want to sugarcoat things, but I also don't want you to lose hope. We’ll work together to do everything we can. Regarding heredity, it can play a role in some forms of optic neuropathy, but it’s not always the case. It's a good idea to inform your family about your diagnosis, especially if you have a family history of vision problems, but there's no need to cause unnecessary alarm. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks after you’ve had the tests. That will give us time to review the results and discuss the next steps. My staff will set that up for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Two weeks… after the tests. I shall mark that on my calendar. And the staff will set that up for me? Very well. Just one final question, Doctor. Is this…condition disabling? Will I be able to continue working? My job… requires precision, accuracy… it's rather demanding. I pride myself on being a competent professional, Doctor. Losing my job… is not an option. Thank you, Doctor. For your…patience. I believe that is all. I shall take my leave now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. It’s too early to say whether this condition will be disabling. Many patients with optic neuropathy are able to continue working, especially if the vision loss is mild or stable. We’ll assess your vision carefully and discuss any potential accommodations you might need. Don’t jump to conclusions. Focus on getting the tests done and we’ll address your concerns as we have more information. Take care, Mr. Alcorta. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
