DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... nice to meet you as well. Um... well, my joints. They're just... stiff in the mornings. Really stiff. It takes a while to get going, you know? I don't... I don't really remember when it started, just that it's been happening.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in the mornings… that can be quite uncomfortable. And you said it’s been happening for a while now, but you don't recall exactly how long?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days, you know? It's not a sharp pain, more like… an ache. A really bad ache when I first wake up. Then it loosens up a little bit. Not a lot, but a little. I mostly just take my time getting out of bed. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It sounds like it's more of a gradual discomfort than a sudden pain, and it eases up somewhat throughout the day. And you mentioned it affects your joints… which joints specifically are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. My hands, definitely. And my knees… yes, my knees are bad too. And… sometimes my shoulders. But mostly the hands and knees. It's hard to… do things, you know? Like opening jars. Or… getting up from a chair. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. Is that what it is?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Lilliana, and getting older can certainly contribute. But we should explore a little further just to be sure. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints – your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I don’t think so. Not really. They sometimes feel… warm, maybe? But not swollen. I look at them, but they look pretty normal, I think. It's hard to tell, though. I don't pay much attention, you know? I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And aside from the stiffness and ache, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Oh dear. Let me think… Not that I can recall. Maybe a little tired sometimes? But everyone gets tired, right? I don’t… I don’t have any fever or anything like that. I don’t really feel sick, just… achy. And slow. Very slow in the mornings. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. Fatigue and feeling slow in the mornings can definitely be part of the picture. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Injuries…? Oh, goodness. I've bumped into things, I'm sure. I'm a bit clumsy, you know? But nothing serious. No broken bones or anything like that. Not that I remember, anyway. It was… a long time ago, if I did. My husband… he used to say I was always bumping into things. But that was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Lilliana. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s… a bit hard to remember, you know? I’ve seen doctors, of course. For… things. But I don't really recall what they said. My husband used to handle all that paperwork. He was very good with those things. I think… I think I had high blood pressure at one point? But I’m not sure. And… I’ve had the usual things, like colds and flu. But nothing serious. I really don't remember any diagnoses, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can work with what we have. And were there any surgeries that you've had?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had a small thing on my face removed once, but it was so small I barely remember it. That was… ages ago. And… that’s all I can think of, really. My husband… he’d know. But… he’s not here anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Lilliana. It's okay if you don't remember everything. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just a little something for my… tummy, sometimes. For indigestion, you know? But not every day. Just when it bothers me. And… that’s it, really. I don’t take much. I try not to. My husband always said too many pills are bad for you. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped when… well, a long time ago. I don’t really keep track anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I can eat anything, I think. I’m not a fussy eater. I used to love seafood, but… I don’t eat much of that anymore. It’s just… hard to cook for one person, you know? But no, no allergies. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better sense of what's going on with your joints. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I get so stiff in the mornings. It takes forever to get going. Just be gentle, please. My joints are a bit… creaky.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be very gentle. First, can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we go. It's a bit cold, isn't it? I always feel the cold.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be a bit cool in here. Here, let me get you a blanket. Now, I’m going to gently examine your hands and knees, just to check for any swelling, warmth, or limited range of motion. I’ll start with your hands. Can you open and close them for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, that’s very kind of you. There we go. It feels a bit stiff, you know? And… a little sore. Especially this one. It’s been bothering me a bit more lately.
DOCTOR: I see. There's a bit of tenderness here, and I do notice some mild crepitus when you move your fingers. Alright, and now let’s check your left hand. Can you open and close that one for me as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. This one isn’t quite as bad, but it still feels a bit stiff, you know? And… a little achy. It’s just… getting old, I suppose. I used to be able to knit for hours, but I can't do that anymore. It’s just too painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Similar tenderness to your right hand, but a little less pronounced. Now, let's move on to your knees. Can you please extend your legs out in front of me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There we go. It feels a bit… awkward, you know? They don’t bend as easily as they used to. They always creak when I do that. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. I don’t notice any significant swelling, and they’re not particularly warm to the touch. Now, can you please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There we go. That’s as far as I can go, I think. It feels a bit… tight, you know? And… a little sore. Especially this one. It’s been bothering me a bit more lately. It cracks when I bend it too. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, I do notice some crepitus, and the range of motion is slightly limited compared to your left knee. And your left knee seems to have a better range of motion. It sounds like there's some mild osteoarthritis affecting both knees, but more pronounced in the right. We should probably get some x-rays to confirm that, just to be sure. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. X-rays? I’ve never had x-rays before. Are they safe? And contrast dye…? I don't think so. I don’t think I’ve ever had that either. I’m not a fussy eater, but I don’t really like anything… fancy. I mostly just eat… simple things. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I really don’t know. My husband always handled all that paperwork. He'd know if I had any allergies. But… he’s not here anymore.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilliana. It's understandable to be unsure. X-rays are generally very safe, and we take all necessary precautions to minimize any exposure. We’d only use contrast dye if absolutely necessary, and we’d always check for allergies beforehand. It’s good to know you haven't had it before. Let’s just focus on the x-rays for now. We'll see what they show, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Would you be comfortable scheduling those today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I suppose so. If you think it's best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? These stiff joints are just… awful. It makes it so hard to do anything. If it will help, then yes, let's schedule the x-rays. Just… tell me when and where to go. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, it shouldn’t hurt. It’s a very quick and simple procedure. You’ll just need to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes the pictures. The technician will explain everything to you. We can schedule them at the imaging center just down the road. How does tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning…? Oh, yes, that should be fine. 9:00 AM… I suppose so. I don’t have much planned tomorrow, you know. Just… a quiet day. Will I need to bring anything? And… how long will it take? I don’t like being out for too long, you know. It makes me tired.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to bring anything at all. Just wear comfortable clothes. The appointment itself should only take about 20-30 minutes, including the paperwork and the actual scan. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, give you a referral form and some instructions to take with you. She’ll go over everything in detail. While we wait for the results, I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen. They might help with the stiffness and discomfort. Have you tried those before?
PATIENT: Oh, ibuprofen… I think so. My husband used to give me something for headaches, but I don't really remember what it was. I mostly just try to rest when I’m in pain, you know? I don’t like taking too many pills. But… if you think it will help, I suppose I can try it. Just… tell me how much to take. I always forget things these days. And… is it safe?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. I’ll write down the instructions clearly for you. You can take 200 milligrams every 6-8 hours as needed, with food. It’s generally safe for most people, but it’s important not to exceed the recommended dosage. And if you experience any stomach upset or other side effects, please stop taking it and let me know. Sarah will review these instructions with you before you leave. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… good. 200 milligrams… every 6-8 hours. With food. I think I can remember that. And… stop if it bothers my stomach. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just want to feel better, you know? These stiff joints are just… awful. I suppose I should go and talk to Sarah now? About the x-rays and the pills?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Sarah is just outside, and she'll get you all set up. She's wonderful, and she'll answer any questions you have. Just let her know you spoke with me, and she'll take it from there. Don't hesitate to ask her anything at all. And I'll see you again after the x-rays to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s all. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I just… hope the x-rays don’t hurt. But… I suppose I’ll find out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. They shouldn't hurt at all, and Sarah will explain everything to you. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
