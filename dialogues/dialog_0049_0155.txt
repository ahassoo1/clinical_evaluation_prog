DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes. It’s… well, my hands shake. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Not sure how long exactly. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days, you know? Just wanted to get it checked, before it gets… worse, maybe?
DOCTOR: Right. A tremor. And you say it’s been happening “for a bit.” Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Maybe… six months? A year? It started slowly, I think. Just a little wobble when I’m trying to do something… like hold a cup. Now it’s… more noticeable. Especially when I get… worked up. Or tired. I don't know, really. It’s hard to say. I used to work with… pipes, big pipes. Water and… things. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Pipes… yes, that could matter. Occupational history is always relevant. So, six to twelve months. Primarily in the hands?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the hands. Sometimes my leg will feel a little shaky too, but it's not… constant. It’s the hands that bother me the most. Makes it hard to, well, do things. I used to be pretty handy, fixed everything around the house. Not so much anymore. It’s just frustrating, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone in your family… experienced anything similar?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had… something with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? And my brother… he wasn't very steady on his feet in his later years. But a tremor… I don't specifically recall anyone with a tremor. It was a long time ago. And, frankly, I don’t remember much about their illnesses. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other problems… Not that I know of. I used to be pretty healthy. Had a bit of trouble with my back when I was working, lifting all those pipes. But that was years ago. And… I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly in… well, a long time. I don’t like going to doctors, if I’m being honest. No insurance, you see. Makes it expensive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I don’t take much in the way of pills. Maybe… once, a long time ago, I had a reaction to something for a cold? But honestly, I can't recall. It wasn’t serious. Just a little rash, I think. Nothing like… anaphylactic shock or anything. I don’t really pay attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Let's have a look. Could you extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. There. Is that what you wanted? It's worse when I hold them out like this, you know. Makes me nervous. I don't like being examined. It feels… undignified. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. It’s quite pronounced, even at rest. Your reflexes are… a little diminished, but not dramatically so. Do you experience any rigidity or stiffness in your limbs?
PATIENT: Rigidity… stiffness? Not really. My joints ache sometimes, like I said, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. I wouldn't say I’m stiff. I can move my arms and legs fine, even if they shake a bit. It's more the shaking that bothers me, not a feeling of being… locked up. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a thing. I told you, I don’t take much. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And it’s not a regular thing. I prefer to tough things out, if I can. All those pills… they just have side effects, don't they? And I don’t want to be adding more problems to my list. Can we be almost done here? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it could be essential tremor, but other possibilities need to be ruled out. I recommend an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. And I’d like a referral to a neurologist for a formal evaluation. They can perform more specialized testing and determine the exact cause of the tremor. I will give you a referral slip. It’s up to you to schedule the appointment.
PATIENT: MRI… neurologist… Oh dear. That sounds… expensive. And complicated. I don’t know, Doctor. I was hoping it was just… something simple. Something I could ignore. Look, I appreciate your time, but honestly… I don't think I can afford all that. Is there… anything else I can do? Perhaps just monitor it? See if it gets worse? I really don't want to go through all that testing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns. However, ignoring a neurological symptom is not advisable. An accurate diagnosis is crucial. While I can't force you to seek further testing, I strongly recommend reconsidering. I’ll write you a prescription for propranolol, a beta-blocker, which can sometimes help manage the symptoms of essential tremor. It's not a cure, but it may provide some relief. If the tremor worsens significantly, or if you develop any other symptoms – such as difficulty walking, changes in speech, or cognitive problems – you must seek immediate medical attention. Is that understood?
