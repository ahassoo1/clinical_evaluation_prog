DOCTOR: Hello Ebony, welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kimm, nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been… forgetting things. It's been happening more and more lately, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're bringing this up – it’s definitely worth looking into, and you shouldn't feel embarrassed at all. Memory issues can happen for lots of reasons. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these forgetful moments?
PATIENT: Um, okay. Well, it's not like… big things, you know? More like… where I put my keys, or a name I should remember. Sometimes I walk into a room and forget why I went there. And recently, I had to ask my neighbor twice what her dog's name was, and I just met the dog last week! It’s just… little things slipping my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So mostly it's difficulty with recalling recent events or names, and things like misplacing objects?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And it's not all the time, which is what makes it so frustrating. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and other days… it’s like my brain is just a little foggy. It’s hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ebony. Fluctuations are common with a lot of different things that can affect memory. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit more detail. Could you tell me roughly when you first started noticing these issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… maybe six months ago? It started really gradually, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly. At first, I just thought I was stressed or tired, you know? But it hasn’t really gotten better, and if anything, it’s a little worse. I'd say maybe three months ago it started to feel more… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, gradually worsening, and more concerning the last three months. And has anything majorly stressful been happening in your life during that time?
PATIENT: Not… hugely major, no. Work’s been busy, as usual, running a practice and all. And my parents aren’t doing so great, health-wise, so I’ve been trying to help them out when I can, which adds a little stress. But nothing like… a big trauma or anything. Just the normal everyday pressures, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, work and family responsibilities adding some stress. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other things just to get a full picture. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, like feeling more anxious or depressed?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a little more easily frustrated than usual? I wouldn’t say depressed, no. But I do find myself getting annoyed more quickly, especially when I can’t remember something. It’s just… irritating! And it makes me worry even more, which doesn't help the mood either, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased irritability and worry. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: No, my sleep is pretty normal, actually. I usually get about seven or eight hours a night. I don't have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Sometimes I wake up feeling a little tired, but that's probably just from working long hours.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a couple of years ago, but that’s it. I'm generally pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and exercise when I can. Oh, and I wear glasses for reading. Is that something I should mention?
DOCTOR: Yes, definitely mention the glasses! It’s good to know everything. Okay, no major medical conditions, just glasses for reading. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospital stays. Never. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. I've always just been a fairly healthy person.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: What do you mean? Like, their medical history?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Are there any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had Alzheimer's. It was… a long process, and very sad. And my uncle, my mother’s brother, he has Parkinson’s. That’s about it, I think. It wasn’t really talked about a lot when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandmother with Alzheimer’s and an uncle with Parkinson’s. That's helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don't drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm pretty straight-laced, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just vitamins, occasionally. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and I haven't been taking anything regularly. Just… a multivitamin now and then. I think that's everything, Dr. Kimm.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ebony. That's a very thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam just to get a baseline and see if there are any obvious physical reasons for your symptoms. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. I’ll also do a quick neurological assessment. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and some basic cognitive functions like your memory and attention. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that right? I’m trying not to move my head, it’s a little tricky!
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Good job. Okay, your eye movements seem normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too tight? I don't want to hurt you!
DOCTOR: No, that's good. Strength is good in both hands. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, for a very simple memory test, I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Got it. Those three words.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions about your orientation to time and place. Do you know today’s date?
PATIENT: Um… today is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: I'm in… Dr. Kimm’s office? At the clinic, I think. The suburban clinic? I'm not very good at remembering places sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. It’s good you know generally where you are. Now, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember earlier – apple, table, penny. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… oh dear. I’m trying to remember. Table… and… I can’t quite… penny? No, that’s not right. I know I heard three words, but they're just… gone. I'm so sorry! This is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Ebony. Don't apologize. It's helpful information. You were able to recall "apple" correctly, but had some difficulty with the other two. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes that warrant further investigation. It's unlikely to be anything acutely dangerous, but it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any deficiencies. I also think it would be beneficial to get a baseline cognitive assessment done by a specialist – a neurologist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Blood work and see a neurologist? Okay. It’s just… it’s a little scary, thinking about what it could be. But I appreciate you taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ebony. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing the unknown. But it’s better to get it checked out and have a clear understanding of what’s going on. Okay, I'll write you a referral to Dr. Lee, a neurologist I work with. She's excellent. I'll also order the blood work, and the lab results will be sent to me. Once I have those results, and Dr. Lee's assessment, we can discuss a treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, and stay physically active. Also, keep a journal of any memory lapses or difficulties you experience. That can be helpful for Dr. Lee's assessment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I guess… how long will it take to get the results and see the neurologist? That’s probably my biggest concern, just… the waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ebony. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. As for seeing Dr. Lee, it can sometimes take a few weeks to get an appointment, depending on her availability. I'll have my staff contact you as soon as we have an appointment scheduled. I will also push for an earlier appointment if possible, given your concerns. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory or have difficulty with basic daily tasks, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any work restrictions that need to be noted?
PATIENT: No, no work restrictions. I can still do my job, thankfully. It's just… worrying about it all the time. I think I'll be okay. I just need to know what's going on. Thank you, Dr. Kimm. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad you came in. It's good to be proactive about your health. My staff will give you the lab requisition form and the referral to Dr. Lee on your way out. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have more information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for listening and taking me seriously. I feel a little better just having a plan, even if it's just waiting for results. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. Remember, we're here to support you through this. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
