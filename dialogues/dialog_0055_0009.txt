DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my eyesight. It’s been getting worse, steadily, I suppose. Not suddenly, thankfully. Though, frankly, I'm surprised it’s taken this long to address it. One expects these things to sort themselves out, you know? It’s just…dimmer, everything. And a bit blurry around the edges.
DOCTOR: "Sort themselves out," you say. Hmm. While some minor visual disturbances can resolve on their own, a progressive worsening of vision rarely does. It’s prudent you’re seeking evaluation. To clarify, Mr. Alcorta, when did you first notice this dimming and blurring?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep meticulous records of such things. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe longer. It’s not as if I was comparing it to a calendar date each morning, you understand. More… a general sense of things not being quite as sharp as they used to be. I suppose it’s been gradual enough that I didn’t truly notice noticing, if that makes any sense. It's frustrating, really. A man needs to see clearly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Alcorta. A vague onset is not uncommon, unfortunately. And yes, clear vision is quite important. Have you noticed this affecting any particular activities?
PATIENT: Well, reading, naturally. Used to be able to sit and pore over a report for hours. Now, I find myself holding things further and further away. And…driving at night is becoming distinctly unpleasant. The glare from other headlights is… bothersome. Quite bothersome, actually. It’s not a safety issue yet, but I anticipate it becoming one if this continues. Though, I do prefer daytime driving, if I'm being perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Reading and night driving... those are good details to know. The glare is particularly concerning. Now, Mr. Alcorta, do you wear glasses or contact lenses currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always had remarkably good eyesight, or so I was told. It was quite a point of pride, actually. My father, he required spectacles from a young age, and it… wasn’t something I anticipated sharing with him, if you understand. Now, it seems, that particular distinction is… lost. It's a bit disappointing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, things change, Mr. Alcorta. It’s rarely a matter of personal failing. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me see… I had a bout of shingles a few years back. Quite painful, that was. And my blood pressure… tends to run a bit high, though I haven't been to see a doctor about it regularly. I manage it with diet, mostly. And… well, that’s about it, I believe. Nothing particularly serious. I’ve always been a rather robust individual. Though, admittedly, robust individuals are still subject to the whims of fate, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: Shingles and occasional hypertension… noted. “Managed with diet” is… not a substitute for medical monitoring, Mr. Alcorta. However, we can discuss that further. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I prefer to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. A bit of skepticism toward the medical establishment, if I’m being candid. And I find a good cup of chamomile tea is often a sufficient remedy for whatever ails me. It’s a rather old family tradition, you see. My grandmother swore by it. And, frankly, I’ve found it quite effective over the years. Though, perhaps my eyesight is proving a challenge beyond its capabilities.
DOCTOR: I see. Very well. Now, Mr. Alcorta, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been remarkably unfussy in that regard. I can tolerate most things, which is… convenient. I’ve never understood individuals who meticulously catalogue their sensitivities. A bit dramatic, if you ask me. Though, one shouldn’t generalize, I suppose. Still, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not that I recall, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Alcorta, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any eye conditions – such as glaucoma or macular degeneration – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. A rather melancholy topic, if I’m being honest. My mother… she developed cataracts in her later years. Required surgery, I believe. And my paternal grandfather… suffered from something the doctor called “poor circulation” in his eyes, though I never truly understood the specifics. It led to…diminished vision, eventually. Though, to be fair, he was a rather…hard-living man. A bit of a rogue, if you catch my drift. Not one for moderation, that one. So, it may not be entirely… hereditary.
DOCTOR: Cataracts and what sounds like potential vascular issues… noted. Now, Mr. Alcorta, and forgive my directness, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What precisely does that entail, Doctor? I trust you aren't inquiring about my…extracurricular activities. I assure you, they are of no medical relevance. I am, or was, a rather private individual. Though, my divorce… was finalized approximately three years ago. A regrettable circumstance, but hardly pertinent to my vision, I should think. I do enjoy reading, when my eyesight permits, and a bit of gardening. And quiet evenings at home, mostly. Is that the sort of information you require?
DOCTOR: I was referring to tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use, Mr. Alcorta. However, your personal life is… irrelevant. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh. That sort of social history. My apologies, Doctor. A momentary lapse in comprehension. No, I do not smoke. Never have. Found the habit rather… vulgar, to be frank. And, frankly, unhealthy. My father was a heavy smoker, and it certainly didn’t do him any favors. I’ve always preferred a clear head, you see. And a clean palate. Though, I do enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner on occasion. A modest amount, of course. For medicinal purposes, naturally.
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, Doctor, a glass of red wine with dinner. Perhaps two on occasion. I wouldn’t describe it as excessive. A social lubricant, if you will. And, as I said, for the purported health benefits. A moderate intake, responsibly enjoyed. I assure you, it doesn’t interfere with my… cognitive functions. Though, I concede, it may contribute to a slightly more…optimistic outlook. But hardly to a detrimental degree. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, that is… sufficient. Now, before we proceed, let me ask one final question. Have you experienced any recent headaches, eye pain, double vision, or flashes of light?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those. No headaches, no pain, no double vision, and certainly no flashes of light. Just…dimness. And a bit of blurriness. A gradual decline in visual acuity, as I’ve explained. It's not a sudden, dramatic affliction. More… a slow fading, if you will. It's rather unsettling, to be frank. One expects these things to remain constant, don't you agree? Though, it seems, expectations are rarely met. Is there anything further you require before we proceed with an examination? I'm rather eager to ascertain the cause of this… predicament.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. If you would please follow my directions. We'll start with visual acuity testing. I need you to read the letters on this chart, starting with the largest ones. Please cover your left eye with this patch.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to cooperate. Though, I must confess, I am not particularly fond of patches. They always feel…restrictive. And a bit undignified. However, if it's necessary to ascertain the extent of this…visual decline, I suppose I can endure it. Here we go then. Let us begin.
DOCTOR: Please read the letters, starting with the top row. Tell me what you see. Don't strain, just read what is clear.
PATIENT: ...Ah. That's… E. Definitely E. And… F. Yes, F. But… it’s rather indistinct, Doctor. Almost…blurred. The next line… is proving more challenging. I can discern… perhaps a P? Though, I wouldn’t wager heavily on it. It's… difficult to focus. It’s not as sharp as it once was, I assure you. This is rather…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Now, cover your right eye, please. We’ll test that eye now. Don’t worry if it’s different. We just need to see how each eye is performing. Start with the top row.
PATIENT: Goodness. This is… worse. Significantly worse. E… yes, definitely E. And… is that an F? Perhaps. But it's… swimming, Doctor. Utterly swimming. The next line is… illegible. I can barely make out shapes, let alone letters. This is… most concerning. I haven't experienced such difficulty in… decades. Is this… normal? For someone of my age, I mean?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Mr. Alcorta. Your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. Given your history, and the findings of this preliminary examination, I suspect we are dealing with more than a simple refractive error. Now, I’m going to check your pupillary response and perform a brief fundoscopic examination. This involves looking into the back of your eyes with a special instrument. It won't be painful, but it will require me to get close to your eyes. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: "Significantly reduced," you say? That sounds… ominous. And "more than a simple refractive error?" I confess, Doctor, your terminology is rather unsettling. As for the examination… please, do explain. I prefer to be fully informed before any…instruments are directed toward my eyes. Though, I must confess, the prospect is… less than appealing. I do have a rather…sensitive constitution. What precisely will you be looking for? And will it cause any…discomfort?
DOCTOR: I will be using an ophthalmoscope to examine your retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels in the back of your eyes. This will allow me to assess the health of those structures and identify any potential abnormalities, such as damage or disease. It won't be painful, but you may experience a bright light and a slight blurring of vision momentarily. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m looking for any signs of macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, or vascular issues, among other things. The bright light is the main discomfort, and I can adjust the brightness if needed. Now, if you’ll please look straight ahead, and keep your head still…
PATIENT: "Abnormalities?" Such as…? Well, never mind. I suppose one must endure unpleasantness for the sake of diagnosis. Cataracts… I did note my mother suffered from those. And “vascular issues” sounds… rather alarming. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But do be gentle, as you promised. And please, inform me if you observe anything…concerning. I prefer not to be kept in suspense. Here we go then. Do try to be swift.
DOCTOR: Hmm. As I suspected. There is evidence of mild drusen in both eyes, particularly in the macula. The optic nerve appears healthy at this time, but there is some narrowing of the retinal vessels. And I observe early signs of cataract formation in both lenses. Mr. Alcorta, this suggests you are developing age-related macular degeneration and early cataracts. The narrowing of the retinal vessels requires further investigation, as it could indicate hypertension-related damage. It's important to manage your blood pressure effectively. We need to perform some additional tests to assess the extent of the macular degeneration and monitor your retinal vessels. I’m going to order an optical coherence tomography scan and a visual field test. We should also schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam and to discuss potential treatment options.
PATIENT: “Drusen”? “OCT scan”? “Visual field test”? Doctor, you are speaking a foreign language! And "treatment options"… What precisely does that entail? Are we talking about… surgery? I confess, the prospect is… deeply unsettling. And "hypertension-related damage"? I manage my blood pressure with diet, as I mentioned. Though, perhaps, as you implied earlier, that is insufficient. This is… rather overwhelming. So, what does this mean? Am I going… blind? Will I be able to continue reading? Driving? This is all… exceedingly concerning. I need a clear explanation, Doctor. In terms I can understand. And a realistic assessment of my prognosis. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxiety. Let’s break this down. Drusen are small deposits that form in the macula, the central part of your retina. They are a common sign of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD can cause blurred vision, particularly in the center of your field of vision. An OCT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to get a detailed view of your macula and assess the severity of the AMD. The visual field test will measure your peripheral vision. The narrowing of your retinal vessels suggests that high blood pressure may be affecting your vision. We need to control your blood pressure to prevent further damage. The good news is, AMD often progresses slowly. In its early stages, it may not cause significant vision loss. However, it’s important to monitor it closely and take steps to protect your vision. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, dietary supplements, and, in some cases, injections or laser therapy. Am I saying you will go blind?
PATIENT: No…no, please don't say that. I simply need to know… what does this mean for my everyday life? Can I still read? Will I be able to drive safely? My… my hobbies, my independence… are they threatened? And these "injections" and "laser therapy"… are they painful? Are they effective? What are the risks? I understand it’s often slow progression, but “slow” is relative, isn't it? I’ve always prided myself on my sharp mind and clear vision. To lose that… it’s… it’s deeply unsettling. Please, Doctor. Give me the most realistic assessment you can. Even if it’s not what I want to hear. I need to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I want to be completely honest with you. The AMD is currently in its early stages, which means significant vision loss is not inevitable. However, it will likely progress over time, and the rate of progression is variable. Regarding your everyday life: Reading will likely become more challenging as the AMD progresses. You may need brighter lights, larger print, or magnification devices. Driving safety is a concern. You'll need to be monitored closely and may eventually need to stop driving if your vision deteriorates sufficiently. I will provide you with a referral to a specialist who can assess your driving capabilities. Regarding treatment: Dietary supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin may help slow the progression of AMD. Injections and laser therapy are reserved for more advanced cases, and they do carry some risks, such as bleeding, infection, and inflammation. We will discuss these options in more detail if they become necessary. It's important to understand that we can manage this condition and protect your vision for as long as possible. We will work together to monitor your condition, adjust your treatment as needed, and ensure your quality of life remains as high as possible. I will schedule you for an OCT scan and a visual field test immediately. I'm also providing a referral to a board certified opthalmologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance, specializing in retinal disorders. She’s excellent, and can give you a more detailed prognosis. Do you have any further questions at this time, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: ...I see. So, it will progress. Inevitably. And... larger print, magnification devices… it's all rather… depressing. I suppose I should expect that. And Dr. Vance… yes, I suppose a specialist is necessary. I just… I hate the thought of more tests, more appointments, more uncertainty. I suppose my biggest concern is… losing my independence. I live alone. I enjoy my hobbies. I need to be able to see. To read. To drive. It's… it's a lot to process. Are there any… lifestyle changes I can make? Besides the supplements? Anything I can do now to slow this down? Any foods to avoid? Any exercises for my eyes? Anything at all? I just… I need to feel like I'm doing something. Anything. To fight this. To protect what little vision I have left.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. And it's commendable that you want to take an active role in managing your condition. Yes, there are several lifestyle changes you can make that may help slow the progression of AMD. First and foremost, protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. Wear sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays whenever you're outdoors. Secondly, maintain a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. Good sources include dark leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, as well as eggs and colorful fruits and vegetables. Thirdly, avoid smoking. Smoking significantly increases your risk of developing AMD and accelerates its progression. Fourthly, maintain a healthy weight and control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Regarding eye exercises, there's no scientific evidence to suggest that they can prevent or slow the progression of AMD. However, some patients find them helpful for maintaining their visual skills. I can provide you with a referral to a low vision specialist who can teach you some exercises. The most important thing is to be proactive, to monitor your condition closely, and to work with your healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and we'll do everything we can to help you maintain your quality of life. I’m also going to give you a pamphlet with detailed information on AMD, and a list of resources for support groups and low vision services. Do you have any further questions at this time, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not at the moment. A pamphlet and a list of resources would be helpful. And I appreciate the reassurance, Doctor. It's… comforting to know I'm not alone in this. I suppose… I suppose I should schedule the OCT scan and the appointment with Dr. Vance. And I’ll try to incorporate those lifestyle changes. It won't be easy, but… I'll try. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. For your time. And for being honest with me. Even when it wasn't what I wanted to hear. I believe that will be all for today. I shall see you again… when the results are in?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, when the results are in. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, Mr. Alcorta. And remember, proactive management is key. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
