DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my boy, he signed me up. Said I gotta get checked out… for somethin’ with sports. I forget what he called it exactly. A tryout, maybe? I'm old, you know. Don't remember things so good these days. Something about bein' on a team?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your son scheduled this as a pre-participation physical, for a senior sports league. That's good he's thinking ahead. So, you’re hoping to join a team?
PATIENT: A senior… league? Oh! Right, right. That’s it. My son, he's always gettin’ me into things. A team… yeah. I used to play… baseball, I think. Long, long time ago. But I ain’t been… active, lately. Mostly just walkin’ with my wife. Is this gonna be… hard? I don't wanna pull a muscle or nothin’.
DOCTOR: It's smart to get checked out before starting anything new, especially after a period of inactivity. We just need to make sure you're healthy enough for the level of activity involved. We'll do a basic physical exam, check your heart and lungs, and ask a few questions about your medical history. Nothing to worry about, just a precaution. Do you have any pain currently, anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really… well, sometimes my knees ache a little, when it’s cold. And my back gets a bit stiff if I bend over too much. But that's just… old age, I guess. It ain’t nothin’ serious, Doctor. I can still get around okay. I walk with my wife every mornin’, like I said. It's just… little aches and pains, you know? Nothing that stops me.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back stiffness. And it’s worse with cold weather. Good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints, or any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, not really swelling. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, after a long walk, but it goes down quick. No redness, no… warmness. Just… feels a little tight, that’s all. My wife rubs ‘em with some cream, and it helps. She’s a good woman, my wife. Always lookin’ after me. But I don't think it's ever been bad bad, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And it's wonderful that you have someone to help you. Alright, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I don’t think so. The doctor checks it sometimes when I get my flu shot, and he always says it’s… okay. Diabetes… no, never had that. My wife’s sister has it, but not me. Heart… hmm. I had a bit of a scare a long time ago, maybe twenty years back. They said somethin’ about my heart beatin’ too fast, but they gave me some pills, and it went away. I stopped takin’ the pills after a while. Is that… bad? I forget what the doctor said.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past cardiac issue, and you were on medication for it. Do you remember what the medication was called, or what the doctor diagnosed at the time?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I really don't. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Little white pills, I think. They made me feel a little… tired. The doctor said somethin’ about my heart rhythm, I think. But I felt fine after a while, so he said I could stop takin’ ‘em. My memory ain't what it used to be. I just remember bein' glad it went away. It was scarey, havin’ trouble with your heart. I don't want to go through that again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember specifics. We can look up your previous medical records to get more details. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I got a little rash once, after eatin’ some shellfish. Shrimp, maybe? But it wasn’t too bad. Just a little itchy. My wife always checks the labels now, just in case. Other than that… no, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I like a good Cuban sandwich, you know. Lots of pork! But no, no allergies that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible shellfish allergy, and otherwise no known allergies. Alright, last question about your history for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see. I take a little pill for my water, the doctor gave it to me. Said somethin’ about my prostate. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my knees, when they really bother me. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The kind you get at the drugstore. And I take a multivitamin, every mornin’ with my breakfast. My wife makes sure I do. She says I need my vitamins, to keep my strength up. That’s it, I think. Just those few things. Is that too much? I don't want to be takin' too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for your prostate, ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My wife always says I gotta listen to the doctor. She's a smart woman, my wife. Go ahead, do what you gotta do. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones ain't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not concerning at this time, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We'll want to monitor that as well. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Alright, everything seems okay at first glance. Now, can you stand up for me so I can check your reflexes and range of motion?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Little creaky, you know? But I can stand. Reflexes… range of motion… what does that mean? My knees feel a little stiff, but that’s just the cold weather, I told you. Be careful, okay? I don't wanna fall. My wife would be worried.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be right here. Range of motion just means checking how well your joints move. And yes, the knees… I understand. Hmm. There's some crepitus with movement, and a slight limitation in full extension. Hips are within normal limits. Alright, everything seems consistent with your age and activity level. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I heard, I’d like to order some routine blood work and an EKG. The blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health, and the EKG will check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is somethin’ wrong, Doctor? My son, he told me not to worry, said it was just a check-up. Is my heart okay? I get a little… breathless sometimes, when I climb the stairs. But that’s just because I’m old, right? I don't wanna have to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down, Mr. Murph. It's good you're asking questions. These tests are routine preventative measures. They don’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. The elevated blood pressure and murmur simply mean we want to investigate further to make sure everything is functioning optimally. The EKG and blood work will give us a clearer picture, and we can rule out any potential issues. The breathlessness you experience when climbing stairs is something we will also discuss. It’s good you mentioned that. We’re not looking for anything specific right now, just establishing a baseline. It's better to be cautious. We can schedule these tests at the clinic, no hospital visit is needed at this point. Does that make you feel a little better?
PATIENT: A baseline… you mean like… checkin' to see where I'm at? No hospital… that's good. My wife would worry somethin’ awful. And you said… breathlessness? So you're gonna check that too? That's good. I just don't wanna be a bother, you know? I don't wanna take up your time with old man problems. But… if you think it's best to check things, then I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a nice man. And my son, he said you were a good doctor. Okay, a baseline… and no hospital. That's good. When can we do these… tests?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right – establishing a baseline. And you are absolutely not a bother, Mr. Murph. That's what I'm here for. We can schedule the blood work and EKG for tomorrow morning, around 9:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… 9:00 AM? That's fine, I guess. My wife usually makes me breakfast then, but she can wait. She understands. Just… tell me what I gotta do, okay? I don't wanna mess it up. And… is there anything I gotta not do before the tests? Like, should I not eat breakfast? Or somethin'? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Perfect. 9:00 AM tomorrow. And here are the instructions. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – so no breakfast, lunch, or dinner tonight. You can drink water. For the EKG, you'll lie on a table while we attach some small stickers to your chest to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… a little uncomfortable. And please, take your usual medications unless I specifically tell you otherwise. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Fast for… eight hours? Oh dear. My wife makes a good breakfast. But… okay, I can skip breakfast. Water, that’s good. Stickers… not comfortable, huh? Well, I can handle a little discomfort. As long as it gets things checked out. No usual medications… okay, I’ll tell my wife. She keeps track of all that. I think… I think that’s it. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I feel a little better now, knowin’ what to expect. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if you have any questions at all before tomorrow, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. And try not to worry too much. We’re just taking preventative measures to ensure you stay healthy and active. We'll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. .
