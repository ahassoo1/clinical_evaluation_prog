DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here today because I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Numbness can be concerning, and it’s wise to get it evaluated. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this numbness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe precisely. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Primarily in my left leg, though sometimes it feels…distant in my right as well. It feels like… pins and needles, but without the prickling sensation, if that makes any sense. More just… absence of feeling, really. It's most noticeable when I've been standing for a long period, or after I've been very physically active.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Intermittent numbness, more prominent in the left leg but occasionally felt in the right, and exacerbated by standing or physical activity. And you describe it as an absence of feeling, not a painful pins-and-needles sensation. Could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… It began, I believe, around late March, early April of this year. So, approximately four months now. At first, I didn’t pay much attention to it. I figured it was just from working long hours on my computer, or perhaps a muscle strain from a recent animation project. It’s just…it hasn't gone away, and it seems to be happening more frequently.
DOCTOR: Four months, starting in late March/early April, initially attributed to work and activity, but now persistent and increasing in frequency. Thank you. Now, could you describe for me where exactly on your left leg you are experiencing this numbness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It usually starts in my foot, specifically the top of my foot and my toes. Then, it radiates upwards, along the outside of my lower leg, sometimes reaching up to my knee. Occasionally, I feel it in my calf muscle, but it’s less consistent there. It doesn't usually affect my thigh. If I had to point to it, it’s primarily along the fibula, I believe is the correct term – the smaller bone in my lower leg.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very specific and helpful. Numbness primarily along the distribution of the fibula, starting in the foot and radiating upwards. Now, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Weakness…that’s a good question. It’s not a complete inability to move it, certainly. But I have noticed, on occasion, that my foot feels…clumsier than usual. Like I might stumble a bit more easily, especially when I’m tired. And I've dropped things a few times lately, things I usually have a good grip on. It’s subtle, but noticeable. It’s hard to explain, like my coordination isn’t quite as precise as it normally is. It doesn’t happen every time, but enough to make me wonder.
DOCTOR: Subtle weakness, clumsiness, and a sensation of decreased coordination, occurring intermittently. Thank you for describing that so well. Have you experienced any pain associated with this numbness?
PATIENT: That's another good question. There isn't really pain in the traditional sense. Not a sharp, throbbing pain, or anything like that. But sometimes, when the numbness is particularly intense, I feel a sort of…aching sensation. It’s a dull, uncomfortable feeling, mostly in my lower leg. And occasionally, I experience a burning sensation, also in my lower leg, but it’s fleeting. It doesn’t happen every time, and it’s not severe, but it’s present sometimes. I’d characterize it more as discomfort than actual pain, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Discomfort – an aching and occasional burning sensation accompanying the numbness, but not severe pain. Now, let's move onto some more general questions. Do you have any history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any history of diabetes myself, and to my knowledge, there isn’t any familial history of it either. My mother is quite health-conscious and we’ve discussed it at length. She’s always been very careful with her diet and exercise, and I’ve followed a similar path. I get regular check-ups and blood work, and everything has always been within normal ranges. I've never been flagged for pre-diabetes or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No personal or family history of diabetes. Have you had any recent injuries to your leg or back?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any recent injuries. Nothing that I can recall, at least. I mean, I occasionally bump into things, as everyone does, but nothing significant enough to cause an injury. I’m fairly careful with my movements, particularly when I’m working. I try to maintain good posture and avoid straining myself. I did have a minor sprain in my ankle a few years ago, during a hike, but that fully healed and hasn’t caused any lingering issues. It was… 2021, I believe. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: No recent injuries, minor ankle sprain in 2021, fully healed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not currently taking any medications. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. I do occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month. And I take a multivitamin daily, just to supplement my diet. Nothing else. I’m generally quite healthy and haven’t needed to rely on prescription medications. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle and address any issues through diet and exercise whenever possible.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, infrequent ibuprofen use, daily multivitamin. Okay, Tarin. Before I proceed with a physical examination, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s infrequent, maybe a few times a year. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle and prioritize my well-being. I’m very active and spend a lot of time outdoors. I find that physical activity helps me to manage stress and maintain a positive outlook. I believe in taking care of my body and mind, and that includes avoiding substances that could be detrimental to my health.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No smoking, infrequent alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Alright, Tarin. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like we need to investigate the cause of this numbness further. I'd like to perform a physical examination now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and gather so much information. I’m happy to proceed with the examination whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgment and would like to understand what’s going on. Please let me know if there’s anything I should do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No special preparation is needed. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll start by checking your reflexes and sensation in both legs. I'll also assess your muscle strength. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. This is perfectly normal and shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay, both reflexes seem normal and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please proceed. Yes, I can feel that. It feels…normal, I suppose. A slight tap, nothing unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright, and here…and here… How about this spot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that one. And…yes, here too. Hmm…that spot…feels a little…distant. Not absent, but…diminished. Like it’s harder to pinpoint exactly where I’m being touched. It's subtle, though. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation in the lateral aspect of the left lower leg. Thank you for pointing that out; it’s important information. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist me as I try to move your leg. Please push back against my hand as hard as you can. I’m going to start with dorsiflexion – lifting your foot upwards. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I’m trying to push against you… I think I’m resisting… it feels… a little weaker than usual, perhaps? It’s not completely absent, but it requires a bit more effort than it normally does. It’s hard to gauge, but I feel like I’m working harder to resist you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I agree – it does appear slightly weaker on the left side compared to the right. Now, let’s try pointing your foot downwards… and turning it inward… and now outward… Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. I've noted some diminished sensation and slight weakness in your left lower leg. Based on what you've told me and my findings, I suspect this could be related to a nerve issue, potentially involving the peroneal nerve, which runs along the outside of your lower leg. However, to confirm this, we need to do some further testing. I would like to order an MRI of your left lower leg to visualize the nerves and rule out any compression or other structural issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds… reasonable. If it will help determine the cause, then yes, that sounds alright. I’m happy to proceed with whatever testing is necessary. The peroneal nerve, you say? Is that something serious? And what would the next steps be after the MRI, depending on the results? I’m…a little anxious, to be honest. I just want to understand what’s going on and get it resolved.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Tarin, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. The peroneal nerve is one of the major nerves in your leg, and it controls the muscles that lift your foot and toes, as well as sensation on the outside of your lower leg. It's not necessarily serious, but it's important to identify the cause of the compression or irritation. An MRI will help us visualize the nerve and rule out things like a herniated disc, a tumor, or any other structural problems. If the MRI shows compression of the nerve, the next steps would depend on the severity of the compression. Mild compression might be treated with conservative measures like physical therapy, bracing, and avoiding activities that aggravate the symptoms. More severe compression might require further investigation, potentially with an electromyography study to assess nerve function, and in some cases, even surgery. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll start with the MRI, get the results, and then discuss the best course of action based on those findings. I'm going to write you a prescription for the MRI. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience. The radiology center will send the results to my office. Once I have them, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that exacerbate your symptoms, and if you experience any worsening of the numbness or weakness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all sounds…reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding strenuous activity is certainly something I can do. And I'll contact the office if things worsen. Just…what are the chances this is something…serious? Like, would I be looking at surgery? Or is it more likely to be a minor issue that can be resolved with physical therapy? I understand you can't give me a definitive answer without the MRI results, but…a general idea would be helpful. I tend to worry, I’m afraid. And is there anything I can be doing now to help alleviate the symptoms? Any stretches or exercises that might be beneficial, or things I should definitely avoid besides strenuous activity?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, and it's good that you're asking these questions. It's difficult to say definitively without the MRI results, but in most cases of peroneal nerve compression, surgery is not required. The majority of cases are successfully treated with conservative measures like physical therapy, bracing, and activity modification. However, it's important to rule out more serious causes, which is why the MRI is crucial. In the meantime, to help alleviate your symptoms, you can try a few gentle exercises. Ankle circles – slowly rotate your ankle in both directions. Ankle pumps – point your toes upwards and downwards. And toe curls – curl your toes inwards and outwards. These exercises can help improve circulation and strengthen the muscles in your lower leg. Also, avoid crossing your legs for extended periods, as this can put pressure on the peroneal nerve. And if you’re sitting for long periods, make sure your chair provides adequate support and allows your feet to rest flat on the floor. As for things to definitely avoid, avoid any activities that cause your symptoms to worsen, and avoid wearing tight shoes or socks that compress your feet. I also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if you’re experiencing any discomfort. But please, don’t exceed the recommended dosage. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Ankle circles, ankle pumps, and toe curls… that sounds manageable. Avoiding crossing my legs is a good reminder. I do tend to do that without thinking. I think… no, that answers most of my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor. And for not dismissing my worries. It’s…reassuring to know that surgery isn’t necessarily the answer. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and will contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again. I believe that’s all for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll take this one step at a time and get to the bottom of this. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
