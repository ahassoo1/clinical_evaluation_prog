DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, well... it's kinda embarrassing, you know? Something...leaking. Down there. Been happening a little while now. Not a lot, but... it's there. I don't know what it is, though. Never had this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, and you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out. Lots of things can cause leaking, and we'll figure out what's going on. When you say "a little while now," could you give me a rough idea how long?
PATIENT: Rough... hmm. Maybe... a month? Two? Time kinda blends together these days, you know? I don't really keep track. It wasn't constant, at first. Just... after. After things. With... a friend. But now it's more often. Not a flood, mind you, just... a little drip. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it started after sexual activity and has become more frequent over the past month or two. Okay. To help me understand better, is this happening only after activity, or does it happen at other times too?
PATIENT: Sometimes...sometimes it happens when I just... go to the bathroom. Not every time, but a few times now. It's weird. I just figured it was...old age, maybe? Things fallin' apart, you know? Never bothered to ask anyone about it.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking now. "Things falling apart" is a common worry as we get older, but it's always best to rule things out and see what's happening. The fact that it happens sometimes after going to the bathroom is helpful information. When you say "after going to the bathroom," do you mean when you urinate, or when you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Oh... um. When I pee. Definitely when I pee. Not... the other thing. Sorry, is that too much information? I don't usually talk about these things. It's just...it's kinda gross, you know? I hope you don't think I'm silly for comin' in about this.
DOCTOR: No, not at all silly! It's very common, and you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out. And it's good to be specific, so thank you for clarifying. Leaking urine when you pee is something we can definitely look into. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you describe the leaking a little more?
PATIENT: Describe...? How to describe... It's just... wet. Like, a little bit of pee comes out even when I don't want it to. It's not a stream, like when you just go normally. More like... drops. And sometimes it smells kinda funny. Not like regular pee. Kinda...fishy? Does that make any sense? I don't know what else to say.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Drops of urine with a fishy odor... that does give me some ideas. It sounds like we need to consider a couple of possibilities. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms...? Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. I mean, I get tired easy, but that's just old age, right? And my knees ache. But that's just...knees. Oh! Sometimes I feel like I don't empty my bladder completely. Like, there's still a little left in there, even after I go. Is that... a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, feeling like you don't empty your bladder completely is definitely a symptom we should talk about. And tiredness and achy knees are good to know, though they might not be directly related to the leaking. Okay, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your abdomen and a pelvic exam. This will help me assess what might be going on. We can also do a urine test to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A...a pelvic exam? Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in...a long time. Is it... necessary? I don't like people pokin' around down there, if you know what I mean. I’m just…sensitive. And a urine test is fine, I guess. But the pokin'... I don't know. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely. Pelvic exams can be uncomfortable, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about them. The exam is helpful because it allows me to check the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder, and to look for any signs of prolapse, which is when the bladder drops down. It can also help us rule out other potential causes. However, we can start with the urine test and a discussion of your history. If the urine test doesn't give us enough information, we can revisit the idea of the exam. We can also talk about ways to make it as comfortable as possible, like positioning and taking breaks. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay...okay, that sounds better. Start with the pee test. And talkin'. Talkin' is good. I don't like surprises, you know? No pokin' right away. Just... see what the pee says first. And you tell me what you're thinkin', okay? No secret business. What kinda stuff are you lookin' for in the pee?
DOCTOR: That sounds perfect. No surprises, I promise. We'll take it one step at a time. In the urine test, we're looking for a few things. Primarily, we're checking for an infection, which can sometimes cause leakage. We're also looking at the levels of certain cells and proteins to see if there's any inflammation or other abnormalities. Sometimes, we can even get a sense of whether your bladder is functioning properly. Let me get a sample first. I'll leave you some privacy, and I'll be right outside when you're finished. Just follow the instructions on the cup.
PATIENT: Alright. Instructions, huh? I hope they're easy. Old eyes don't see so good anymore. I'll be back when I'm done. Don't go anywhere.
DOCTOR: I won’t. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Here. All done. Try not to spill it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I'll send this off to the lab right away. It usually takes a few minutes to get the results back. While we're waiting, let's talk a little more about your history. Have you ever been pregnant?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're askin' about that. No, never been pregnant. Never married, never had kids. Just...me. Always just me. Always been a bit too busy with my paintin', I guess. And...well, it just never happened. Is that important? I don't see what that has to do with my leakin'.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that felt too personal. It’s important information because pregnancy can sometimes affect the pelvic floor muscles. But you’re right, it’s not always relevant. Let’s move on. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! I broke my wrist once, so I had surgery to fix that. A long time ago. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. Just the tonsils and the wrist. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. No major abdominal or pelvic surgeries is good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems – like trouble with bladder control, or leaking urine?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she never talked about these things. My auntie, she had some trouble after havin’ babies, but that was a long time ago, and she never said exactly what trouble. No one really talked about peein’ problems, if you know what I mean. It was considered… shameful, I guess. So, I don't really know. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for these things to be kept private. Okay, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink a lot of fluids?
PATIENT: Oh, I like my water. Gotta stay hydrated, you know? Especially with the paintin', it dries you out. I probably drink… oh, maybe six or eight glasses a day? Sometimes more when it’s hot. And I like a little juice with breakfast. Not too much, though. Gotta watch my sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight glasses a day is fairly typical. And do you have any trouble with constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah, sometimes. Gets a little backed up, if you know what I mean. Especially when I'm really focused on my paintin', I forget to… well, you know. And then it gets difficult. I take a little somethin' for it every now and then, but I don't like relyin' on pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some occasional constipation. That can definitely contribute to bladder problems. Okay, good news. Your urine test came back clear. No infection, no inflammation, nothing obvious to explain the leakage. That narrows things down. It's less likely to be something serious.
PATIENT: Clear? No infection? That's... good, right? I was worryin' about somethin' awful. So, what does that mean? If it’s not an infection, what is makin' me leak? Is it just… old age then? Is this somethin' I just have to live with?
DOCTOR: It's good news that there's no infection. That rules out a common cause. It doesn't necessarily mean it's just "old age", although getting older can weaken the muscles that support the bladder. Based on what you've told me—the leakage after urination, sometimes after bowel movements, feeling like you don't empty your bladder completely, and the occasional constipation—it sounds like you might have something called stress urinary incontinence and possibly a bit of urge incontinence as well. Do those terms mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Stress… and urge…? No, those don’t mean a thing to me. I don't speak doctor talk. What are they? Are they…bad? Are they gonna need pokin' to fix 'em?
DOCTOR: No, they’re not necessarily bad, and we don’t have to jump to “pokin’” right away. Let me explain. Stress urinary incontinence means you leak a little bit of urine when you put pressure on your bladder – like when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exercise. It happens when the muscles that support your bladder aren’t strong enough. Urge incontinence is when you suddenly feel a strong urge to urinate, and you can’t hold it long enough to get to the bathroom. It sounds like you might have a little of both. The leakage after urination and bowel movements suggests stress incontinence, and feeling like you don’t empty your bladder completely can contribute to the urge incontinence. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… weak muscles? That’s it? It’s just… weak muscles? I’ve been doin’ paintin’ for fifty years. My muscles are plenty strong! I hold those brushes all day! But… what can I do about weak muscles down there? Is there somethin’ I can take? Or some kinda exercise? I don’t want to wear diapers! And I definitely don’t want any pokin’!
DOCTOR: You're right, your hands and arms are likely very strong from painting! But the pelvic floor muscles are different—they’re a specific group of muscles that support your bladder and bowel. They can weaken over time, especially after childbirth, with age, or from things like constipation. Fortunately, there are things we can do about it! Diapers aren’t the first step. The first line of treatment is usually pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. They strengthen those muscles. I can show you how to do them correctly. It takes practice, but many people see improvement with consistent exercise. We can also talk about bladder training techniques to help you control the urge to urinate. Would you be willing to try those exercises?
PATIENT: Exercises… huh. I guess I can try. I don’t like the sound of “training” my bladder, but exercises… I can probably manage exercises. Are they hard? And how long do I have to do 'em before I see any difference? I don't have all day to be squeezin’ things!
DOCTOR: They’re not hard, but they do take consistency. It’s like any other exercise – you need to do them regularly to see results. Basically, you squeeze the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. You can do them anywhere, anytime—while you’re watching TV, while you’re waiting in line, even while you’re painting! It usually takes a few weeks to a few months of consistent exercise to see a noticeable difference. We can start with a simple routine – maybe 10-15 squeezes three times a day. I can give you a handout with instructions and some helpful tips. I’ll also show you how to do them correctly, because it’s important to squeeze the right muscles. Let’s practice a few right now, just to make sure you’re getting it right. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay…okay, I guess I’m ready. But don’t expect miracles! And try not to make me feel silly. Show me what I gotta do. But gently, okay? Gently.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, gently. No pressure at all. It might feel a little strange at first, but that’s perfectly normal. Okay, imagine you’re trying to stop yourself from urinating. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that. Not your butt muscles, not your thighs, just those muscles right there. Hold for a few seconds… one… two… three… and relax. Good. That’s it. Now, try doing that a few more times on your own. Don't squeeze too hard, just a gentle squeeze. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm…it’s kinda hard to find the right muscles. I think I’m squeezin’ my butt a little bit. And my thighs. It's just… everything feels tight down there! Is it supposed to feel like that? Like I gotta pee but I can’t? It's makin' me nervous!
DOCTOR: That’s very common! It takes practice to isolate the right muscles. You’re not alone in feeling like you’re squeezing everything! It’s good that you noticed you’re also squeezing your butt and thighs – that means you’re aware of your muscles, which is the first step. Try to relax your butt and thighs. Focus on squeezing only those muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. It might help to imagine you’re trying to lift something small from between your legs. Let’s try a different position. Sometimes lying down makes it easier to isolate the muscles. If you're comfortable, could you lie back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Lying down… okay, I guess. But don’t expect miracles, remember? These old muscles don't work like they used to. Now what? Just squeeze these… these secret muscles? It feels kinda weird laying down.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It is a little weird at first! Let’s try again. Take a deep breath… and now, squeeze those muscles, like you’re trying to stop the flow of urine. Good. Now, relax. Can you feel a slight tightening in your pelvic area?
PATIENT: Hmm… yeah, I think so. It's kinda subtle. Not a big squeeze, just… a little tightening. And I’m definitely not squeezin’ my butt this time! Is that right? Am I finally doin' it right? It feels different when I'm lyin' down.
DOCTOR: Yes! That’s it! You are doing it right! That subtle tightening is exactly what you should be feeling. You’ve isolated the right muscles – that’s fantastic! Now, let's try a few sets of squeezes. I want you to squeeze for 5 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds. Repeat that 10 times. We'll call that one set. Then, we'll take a short break, and do two more sets. I’ll time you. Just let me know when you're finished with each set. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay…okay, I can try that. Five seconds squeeze, five seconds relax, ten times… It sounds like a lot of squeezin'. But I guess if this helps… Alright, let’s get it over with. Start the clock! One… two… three…
DOCTOR: Good. You're doing great. Remember to breathe normally. Don’t hold your breath. And don’t squeeze too hard. Just a gentle, controlled squeeze. Okay, relax… now squeeze… and relax… you’re doing really well. Keep going.
PATIENT: Ugh…seven…eight…nine…ten! Done! My muscles are tired! Is that normal? Now what? Take a break? This is harder than it looks!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal! It is harder than it looks, and your muscles are working hard! You did great! Let’s take a short break – maybe a minute or two – and then we’ll do two more sets of 10. You can rest your muscles during the break. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Okay…okay, I think I can do two more. My muscles still feel kinda tired, but… I guess I got this. It's just…squeezin’ things. Alright, let’s get it over with. Start the clock again! One… two… three…
DOCTOR: Good. You're doing great. Remember to breathe normally. Don't squeeze too hard, just a gentle, controlled squeeze. Okay, relax... Now squeeze... and relax... You're doing really well. Keep going. Almost there. Just a few more squeezes. You've got this!
PATIENT: Nine…ten! Done! Finally! My muscles are really tired now. I think I squeezed everything! Is it okay if I stop now? I did it, though! Two whole sets! I’m kinda proud of myself, actually.
DOCTOR: You absolutely did it! You did two whole sets, and you should be proud of yourself! That’s fantastic, especially for your first time. And yes, it’s perfectly okay to stop now. Your muscles deserve a rest! Now, the key is to practice these exercises regularly. Try to do them at least three times a day, if you can. It might take a few weeks or months to see a noticeable improvement, but consistent practice will make a big difference. Do you have any questions about the exercises?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Squeeze for five seconds, relax for five seconds, three times a day. Sounds easy enough… but it’s kinda harder than it looks! What about the other thing you said? The bladder training? Is that like…telling my bladder what to do? It sounds kinda silly.
DOCTOR: It does sound a little silly, doesn't it?
PATIENT: You're right, it is a little silly. But it can be helpful. Bladder training is basically learning to control the urge to urinate. It’s like retraining a muscle. Here’s how it works. When you feel the urge to go, try to delay it for a few minutes. Don’t rush to the bathroom. Try to distract yourself – take a few deep breaths, count backwards, or think about something else. When you finally go, try to empty your bladder completely. Over time, you can gradually increase the amount of time you delay going to the bathroom. This helps to strengthen your bladder muscles and reduce the urge to urinate frequently. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So…holding it? Like, when I gotta pee, I just… hold it? What if I can't? What if I leak? That'll just make it worse! And what if I'm out somewhere? What if there's no bathroom nearby? This sounds kinda scary, actually.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about it. You're right, holding it isn't about completely ignoring the urge - and definitely not about making yourself uncomfortable or leaking! We start small. When you feel the urge to go, and it's not an emergency – like you're not about to burst – try to delay it for just a few minutes. Maybe five minutes at first. If you can manage that, gradually increase the time. If you can't hold it, or you're worried about leaking, don't force it. Go to the bathroom. This isn't about punishing yourself. It's about gradually retraining your bladder. And of course, if you're out somewhere and there's no bathroom nearby, don't panic. Just go when you need to. We can start slowly and adjust the training to your comfort level. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Okay…okay, starting slowly sounds better. Just a few minutes at a time. And not panicking if I can’t hold it. That makes sense. It’s still kinda scary, but… I guess I can try. So, squeeze things three times a day, and hold it a little bit when I gotta pee. Is that it? Anything else I gotta do?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it! Squeeze things three times a day, and try to delay going to the bathroom a little bit when you feel the urge. One other thing: try to drink plenty of fluids, but avoid drinking a lot right before bedtime. This will help to reduce the urge to urinate at night. And of course, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call me. We can adjust the plan as needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. You explained everything pretty good, actually. It’s still kinda scary, but I guess I’m ready to try. Thank you, Doctor. You weren’t as scary as I thought you’d be. I guess I’ll go home and squeeze things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. And you're right, you don't have to be scared. It was my pleasure to meet you, Jimmi. Remember, be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if it takes time to see results. I'm here to support you every step of the way. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment in a month. If you have any questions before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, and have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
