DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating, like it says. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It just...happens. Makes my stomach feel like a balloon. It’s uncomfortable, okay? And it's been going on...a while now, I guess. Look, is there a quick fix for this or what?
DOCTOR: "A while now," is helpful, Mr. Kristofik, but not particularly informative. We need to establish a timeline to understand what's going on. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. Look, I work. I drive a pile driver. It’s not exactly a job where you sit around keeping track of when your stomach puffs up. Months, maybe? Longer? I don't know! It comes and goes. It’s just…annoying. Is that good enough? I've got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: It’s frustrating when your health interferes with your livelihood, I understand. However, to properly assess this "annoyance," I need details. Months is…broad. Does it happen every day?
PATIENT: Every day? No, not every day. More like…a few times a week? Sometimes more if I eat something…I don't know…rich? Or too much? Honestly, it’s hard to say. I eat when I can, you know? Long hours. And it’s not like I'm writing down what I eat and when my stomach acts up. Look, are you a doctor or a detective? I just want something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: I am a doctor, Mr. Kristofik. And to be a good doctor, I need information. “Something to make it stop” is not a diagnosis. It’s also not safe to prescribe medication without understanding the cause of your bloating. Now, let’s try this: besides eating "rich" foods, do you notice anything else that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I told you, I drive a pile driver all day. It's a rough job. Maybe it’s the vibrations? I don't know! Maybe it’s stress. Being a widower isn't exactly relaxing, you know? It’s probably just…life. Honestly, I don’t have time to play twenty questions about my stomach. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: The vibrations could be a factor, and stress absolutely can contribute to digestive issues. It's good you mentioned that. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? You’re asking me about my…bathroom stuff? Look, I don’t come in here to discuss that with strangers. It’s…private. I'm not comfortable with this line of questioning. Is this normal? All doctors ask this much? I think I'm starting to feel a little... anxious, if that counts for anything. Can we just get to the point? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your discomfort, but these questions are medically relevant. Changes in bowel habits – whether that’s frequency, consistency, or any associated pain – can point to a number of underlying issues, some of which are quite serious. It’s not about being nosy; it's about providing appropriate care. However, if you are truly uncomfortable discussing this, we can proceed without that information, but it will limit my ability to accurately assess your condition. Do you have any fever, nausea, or vomiting associated with this bloating?
PATIENT: Look, no fever, no vomiting, no…anything else dramatic, okay? Just bloating. It’s uncomfortable, it’s annoying, and frankly, it’s embarrassing to even be talking about it. And no, I don't have any consistency issues, if that's what you're asking. I really think this is a waste of my time. Can we just give me something for the gas and be done with it? I have things to do. I’m a busy man. Is that really too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Given your reluctance to provide further information, and in the interest of time, I can suggest an over-the-counter simethicone product for gas relief. However, I strongly advise you to return if the bloating worsens, is accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. I will document your refusal to discuss further details. Would you like me to write you a brief work note excusing you from physically demanding tasks if the symptoms persist?
