DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning? I don’t really remember what he said, exactly. Just… learning stuff here. Is this a long visit? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, we'll try to be efficient. It sounds like this might be a general check-up, then?
PATIENT: Check-up? I don't feel sick. I just... work. I work with metal. Sheet metal. It’s hard work, you know? Lifting and bending… Is that what this is about? My back sometimes feels… not good. But I work through it. It’s just a job.
DOCTOR: Right, sheet metal work. That can definitely put a strain on your back. Okay, so the back pain is the main concern, even if it’s something you’ve been pushing through?
PATIENT: Concern? No, not really a concern. More like… annoying. It's always there, a little bit. Sometimes worse than others. I take… something. A red pill. I don’t know the name. My coworker gave it to me. Is that bad? It helps the pain. I just want to know if I need to… stop working. My husband worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, hold on a moment. A red pill from a coworker… that’s definitely something we need to talk about. We absolutely need to identify what that is. Do you happen to know the dosage or anything else about it?
PATIENT: Dosage? No. It's just… a little red pill. Small. He said it helps with aches. I don’t know why he gave it to me, exactly. He’s older, maybe he had something similar? I just took it. It stops the pain so I can keep working. My husband… he doesn't understand. He always makes a big deal out of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I understand you want to keep working, and that you're frustrated with the worry. But taking medication you haven't been prescribed, especially something you don't know the name of, can be really dangerous. It’s important for us to figure out exactly what that pill is. Before we go further, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Not that I know of. I’ve never really been sick. Just… tired sometimes. From the work. And the back. I think my husband took me to the doctor once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember what they said. He handles all that. I just… work. Is this going to take much longer? I have to pick up my daughter after this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions, husband manages your healthcare. Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I don't like hospitals. Too… cold. And scary. I just... work. Metal. It's better than being in a hospital. Is this about the hospital? Are you going to send me to the hospital? I don’t want to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: No, Airam, I'm not going to send you to the hospital right now. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health. No surgeries, that's good. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of health problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mother… she was… small. Like me. She always complained of aches. But she didn’t work with metal. She… cooked. And cleaned. My father… he was strong. He died a long time ago. I don’t remember much about his health. He just… stopped. Is this important? I really need to know if I can go back to work today. My boss is counting on me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your mother had aches, your father passed away. We'll keep that in mind. Let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Well, mostly everything. I like noodles. And dumplings. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. My husband says I eat too much sugar, but that’s not an allergy. Is that what you mean? Really, I just want to know if this red pill is going to be okay. He says it helps, but you seem… worried.
DOCTOR: Airam, you’re right to be concerned, and I am worried. Taking an unidentified pill is risky, and we need to find out what it is immediately. Before we get into trying to identify the pill, let’s just quickly go over what medications you are currently taking, even if it's just this one from your coworker. Can you describe the pill to me in as much detail as possible?
PATIENT: It’s… small. Red. Round. I think. It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t taste like anything. Just… a pill. It's not big. Smaller than my fingernail. My husband keeps it in a little plastic bag. He says he gets it from… someone at the market. That’s all I know. I really don’t like this. Why do you keep asking about the pill? Is it bad? I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re telling me all of this, Airam. Yes, it could be bad. We need to know what’s in it to make sure it isn't harmful, and to prevent any unwanted side effects. It's unsafe to take medications without knowing what they are. I’m going to ask you some questions about your symptoms, then I'm going to do a quick physical exam to see how your back is doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam? You’re going to… touch my back? I don't like being touched. Especially not my back. It hurts. But… okay. If I have to. But no poking. And be quick. I really need to get back to work. And tell me what’s in that pill. That’s the most important thing. What’s in the red pill?
DOCTOR: Alright, no poking, I promise. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And you’re right, finding out what’s in that pill is the most important thing. First, let's talk about this back pain. Can you show me where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Here. And here. It's always a little sore, but it gets worse when I lift things. Like… metal sheets. Or my daughter. Sometimes it feels like a sharp pain. And sometimes it just… aches. Like a really bad bruise. But I work through it. I have to. It's just my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to gently feel your back. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Okay, that does seem a little sensitive. And does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: It feels… warm. And it makes it hurt more when you touch it. And… sometimes it goes down my leg. Not all the way, just… a little. Like a tingling. And it’s worse at the end of the day. When I'm really tired. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. I just know it hurts. And I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. So, pain in your lower back radiating down your leg, worse at the end of the day. I’m also noticing some muscle tension here. I’m going to have you try a few simple movements for me, if that’s okay. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ow. That hurts. Not a lot, but… it’s not good. I can’t really touch my toes. I used to be able to, but not anymore. It feels like something is… stuck. Like a knot. It’s worse when I bend down. And it makes my legs feel… wobbly. I don’t want to fall. Can I stop now? It’s really hurting.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Stop right there. You don’t need to push yourself. Okay, so limited range of motion, pain with bending forward. That gives me some ideas about what might be going on. Airam, I’m a little worried about your back, and very worried about that pill you're taking. I'm going to write down some orders for some imaging - an X-ray and possibly an MRI of your lower back - to get a better look at what’s happening. And I’m going to give you a referral to a physical therapist to help with your pain. But first, and most importantly, we need to identify that pill. Do you have the plastic bag with you?
PATIENT: Here. This is it. My husband… he keeps it hidden. He says it’s for emergencies. But I take it almost every day. He's going to be mad if I brought it. I don’t want him to be mad. But I want to know what's in it. And I really, really want to know if it's bad for me. Please, tell me it's not bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. Thank you for bringing this. This is a good step. I’m going to send this to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results, but we will find out exactly what’s in this pill. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to stop taking it. I know you're worried about your husband, but your health is the most important thing. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant and some over-the-counter pain medication to help manage your back pain while we wait for the lab results. And remember, we're going to figure this out together. .
