DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, state the reason for your visit today. And try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Right, okay. Results discussion only, like we said on the phone. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Just want to know what everything means, quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kovtun, I recall. “Quickly” is not always conducive to thoroughness, but we shall attempt to be efficient. I have your lab results here. Before we begin, are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s why I’m here for results only. Everything felt normal when I scheduled this, and still does. I don’t get sick often, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Very well. Your complete blood count was within normal limits. Cholesterol is slightly elevated – 210 mg/dL. Triglycerides are also a bit high, at 180 mg/dL. Your thyroid stimulating hormone was normal, as was your basic metabolic panel. Vitamin D is… suboptimal, at 25 ng/mL. Do you understand these terms, or should I refrain from using medical terminology?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t understand any of that. Just tell me what’s wrong, basically. Is it bad? And what do I need to do about it? Keep it simple, please.
DOCTOR: "Wrong" is a rather dramatic term, Ms. Kovtun. Let us say… there are areas for improvement. Your cholesterol and triglycerides are mildly elevated. This can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, though at your age, it is not immediately concerning. The Vitamin D is low – that can cause fatigue and muscle weakness, though you do not presently report either. Essentially, we need to address your lifestyle. Are you exercising regularly?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I work long hours as a logistician – lots of paperwork, phone calls, coordinating shipments… it’s mostly sitting, honestly. I try to walk when I can, but it’s not a lot. Does that matter? Is that why the numbers are off?
DOCTOR: It is highly probable, Ms. Kovtun. Sedentary lifestyle is a significant contributor to these imbalances. Diet also plays a crucial role, of course. What does your typical daily diet consist of?
PATIENT: Okay, look. I eat a lot of takeout. It’s fast and easy, you know? Usually something with rice and chicken, or noodles. I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake at work. I try to have some fruit, but… not always. Is that terrible? I didn't realize this was a diet lecture. I just wanted to know what the numbers meant.
DOCTOR: It is… suboptimal, Ms. Kovtun. The takeout, the limited fruit intake, the excessive coffee… these contribute to the elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. It's a matter of caloric intake and nutritional deficiencies. We can discuss medication, but I prefer to exhaust conservative measures first. I recommend a significant dietary overhaul – reduced processed foods, increased fruits and vegetables, and regular physical activity – at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. We can schedule a consultation with our nutritionist, if you wish. I will also prescribe a Vitamin D supplement – 2000 IU daily. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Okay, so… change my diet and exercise more, and take a pill. I can do that, I guess. Is the vitamin D thing serious? Like, will I get really sick if I don't take it? And how long before I see a difference in the numbers if I do change everything? I have to get back to work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a relative term, Ms. Kovtun. Severe Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia and increased risk of fractures, though you are not presently exhibiting those symptoms. It is more a matter of optimizing your overall health and preventing future complications. As for the numbers, it typically takes 3-6 months of consistent dietary and lifestyle changes to see a noticeable improvement. We will recheck your levels in six months to assess your progress. I am writing you a prescription for Vitamin D 2000 IU daily. I also have a handout detailing a heart-healthy diet that I suggest you review. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just… change my diet, exercise, take the pill, and come back in six months. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I really need to get going now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kovtun. I trust you will adhere to these recommendations. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any adverse effects from the supplement. Good day.
