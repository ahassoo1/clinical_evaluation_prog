DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not easy like before. It takes a long time, and… well, it just doesn’t go easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Difficulty… that’s a big word. It just… feels like it takes a lot of pushing. And sometimes, even after I think I’m done, it feels like there’s still some left. It’s not painful, exactly… just… frustrating. My husband, he says I take too long in the bathroom!
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s more of a slow stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying, rather than pain?
PATIENT: Slow stream… yes, that’s right! Very slow. And… empty… no, not empty. Feels like I gotta try again. Like a car that doesn't quite start, you know? Gotta try and try. It’s been… a while now. Maybe a few months? I don’t really keep track of dates so well these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of a slow stream and feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes – like needing to go more often, or any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go right away?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. I do get up a couple times at night, but I always have, I think. Old age, you know? I don’t think it’s more than before. Maybe… a little? But I’m not sure. It’s hard to say. Everything gets mixed up in my head sometimes. I drink a lot of water, though. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nighttime urination is something you’ve experienced for a while, and you drink a good amount of water. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. I would remember that! And pain… no, not really. A little achy sometimes, but that’s just my old bones, I think. My husband rubs them when they bother me. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like after a long day of gardening. I used to have a beautiful garden, you know. Roses, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear there’s no blood and no sharp pain. It sounds like the ache is more of a general discomfort. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that have been diagnosed, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… that’s a long list! Let me think… I had a little trouble with my sugar a while back, the doctor said. But they gave me some pills, and it went away. And… my blood pressure, yes, that goes up and down. I take a pill for that too. My husband keeps track of all the pills. I forget which ones are for what, honestly. I used to be so good with remembering things! It’s just not the same anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of some blood sugar issues that was managed with medication, and high blood pressure currently managed with medication. Do you remember the names of those medications, or could your husband tell us?
PATIENT: Oh, the names… no, no I don’t. Too many pills! He has a list, though. A very long list. He keeps it in the kitchen, in a little box. He’s very organized, my husband. Always has been. He’ll know everything. I just… take them when he tells me to. I’m sorry I can’t be more help. My memory is just… gone a lot of the time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It’s very helpful that you’re on medication for blood pressure, and that your husband keeps track of everything. We can certainly ask him for the medication list. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a mango tree! But that was when I was young. No… I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Nothing serious, anyway. Just a few doctor visits here and there. It’s all so blurry now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm, but no major surgeries or hospitalizations recently. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family… oh, my family. My mother… she had a weak heart. She died when I was young. And my brother… he had something with his sugar. Diabetes, I think. My sister… she was always healthy, as far as I know. But we didn’t see each other much when we got older. It’s been a long time. I don’t remember much about their illnesses, honestly. Everything is just… fading away. It’s hard to keep track of everything after so many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease in your mother and diabetes in your brother. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always says I have a cast iron stomach! I haven’t had any trouble with anything, really. No itchy rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing. I’m very lucky, I think. But… maybe I should ask my husband, just to be sure. He remembers things better than me. He always does. Is that alright? I don't want to miss anything important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It’s always best to double-check. And yes, your husband can certainly help. Okay, so it sounds like you don’t believe you have any allergies. One last question: are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies, in addition to the medications your husband manages?
PATIENT: Oh, vitamins… let me think. My neighbor, she gave me some… something for my bones. Said I needed it. It’s in a little bottle, in the kitchen, with all the other pills. I take it sometimes, when I remember. And… my daughter sends me some fish oil, for my heart. But I forget to take it most of the time. It's all so confusing! I just take what people give me, honestly. I should really write all this down, shouldn't I? But… well, you know. My memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you take some calcium supplements and fish oil occasionally. Okay, Zoie, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. That will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… alright, dear. That’s fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. My bones are old and creaky. And… maybe my husband can come in too? He likes to know what’s going on. Just in case I forget what you say.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Zoie. Your husband is more than welcome to stay. Would you like me to call him in now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be lovely. He’s probably wondering where I am. He worries so much.
DOCTOR: While we're waiting for him, can you tell me about your typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, my typical day… well, it's not very exciting. I wake up when my husband does, usually around seven. He makes me breakfast – toast and eggs, mostly. Then I sit on the porch and watch the birds. They're very pretty. I used to garden, but I can't do that anymore. My back… it just doesn’t allow it. I read sometimes, but my eyes get tired. Mostly, I just… rest. And visit with my husband. He takes care of everything, you know. He’s a good man. It’s a quiet life, but it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Zoie. It's wonderful that you have such a supportive husband. Ah, here he is. Welcome! I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s lovely to meet you. We were just chatting about Zoie’s day. Perhaps you could help me confirm the medications she's taking?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, this is my husband, Sione. He remembers everything! Sione, Dr. Maskal is very kind and wants to know what pills I take. Tell the doctor, dear. I always forget. He’s much better at remembering than I am, you see!
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Zoie has a bit of trouble with her memory these days. Let me see… She takes Lisinopril for her blood pressure, 10 milligrams daily. And she used to take Metformin for her sugar, but the doctor took her off of that a few years ago. She also takes a calcium supplement with Vitamin D, one tablet twice a day. And a fish oil capsule, sometimes, when she remembers! She gets a little forgetful, as you can see. And she occasionally takes a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. I keep a list in the kitchen, just to be sure. Is there anything else I can tell you, Doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! He remembers everything. You’re a good man, Sione. The best husband a woman could ask for. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I pee easily anymore?
DOCTOR: Thank you both for providing such a thorough history. It sounds like Zoie has been well cared for. Zoie, it’s understandable to be concerned when you’re experiencing difficulty with urination. Based on what you’ve told me, and the medications you’re taking, it could be a few different things. One possibility is that your bladder isn’t emptying completely, which can happen with age or certain medications. Another possibility is that there might be some mild blockage, or a weakening of the bladder muscles. It’s also important to rule out a urinary tract infection, although you haven’t mentioned any pain or fever, which are typical symptoms. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, as we discussed. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and do a gentle neurological exam. Then, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection. And finally, I might recommend a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scan… and a test… alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again. It’s embarrassing, you know? Having to go so slowly… and not being able to empty everything. Will it hurt, Doctor? I don’t like pain. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. I trust you. And my husband will be right here with me, just in case.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt, Zoie. The physical exam is very gentle, and the urine test is just a simple sample. The bladder scan is completely painless – it uses sound waves, like an ultrasound, to measure the amount of urine in your bladder. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. Would you like to be involved in the exam, or would you prefer to wait over here?
PATIENT: I’ll stay right here with Zoie, Doctor. I always like to know what’s going on. And she gets a little nervous sometimes, so I like to be here to support her. Just let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. Are you ready, dear? We can do this together.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sione. That’s wonderful. Zoie, if you’re comfortable, let’s start with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, to check for any abnormalities. Then, I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I’ll also check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam. Just relax, and take deep breaths. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen… Does that hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little… tender, maybe, on the lower part. Here. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like when I eat too much. It’s been like that for a while, I think. I don’t really pay attention to it much. Everything gets mixed up in my head sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. That could be due to a number of things, Zoie. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern, but it’s good to note. Everything else sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that right? My knees aren’t as good as they used to be. Arthritis, you know. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best. I want to help you figure out what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Zoie. You’re doing great. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is normal for your age. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. Everything else seems normal so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds okay. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Okay, Zoie, that completes the physical exam. Everything sounds relatively normal, but the tenderness in your lower abdomen and the diminished reflexes are worth noting. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, she's been having trouble sleeping lately too. And she gets a little confused sometimes, forgets things. Is that connected to the urination problem? Could it be something serious? She’s a little worried, and so am I. We just want to make sure she’s okay. She’s everything to me.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to consider, Sione. The trouble sleeping and occasional confusion could be related to the urination problem, but it’s also important to rule out other causes. The combination of symptoms – the difficulty with urination, the tenderness in the lower abdomen, the trouble sleeping, and the occasional confusion – could indicate a few different things. One possibility is a urinary tract infection, even though she doesn’t have any typical symptoms like fever or pain. Another possibility is a bladder obstruction, which is a blockage in the bladder that prevents it from emptying completely. And in rare cases, it could be a sign of a more serious condition like dementia or a neurological disorder. However, it’s too early to jump to any conclusions. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. First, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection. Then, I’d like to order a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in her bladder after she urinates. And finally, I might recommend a blood test to check her kidney function and rule out other underlying conditions. Would you be comfortable with those tests, Zoie?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel normal again. Tests are okay. As long as you tell me what’s going on. And my husband will be right here with me, just in case. He remembers everything. Let’s do the tests. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The urine test is simple – you’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup. And the bladder scan is completely painless – it uses sound waves, like an ultrasound, to measure the amount of urine in your bladder. It won’t take long at all. Could you please prepare a urine collection cup and schedule a bladder scan for Zoie?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to your assistant. I appreciate everything you’re doing. Let’s get this over with, dear. Then we can go home and relax. Maybe watch a little television. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get you taken care of as quickly and comfortably as possible. The assistant will show you to the restroom to collect the urine sample, and then we’ll do the bladder scan right here in the examination room. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Just the tests, please. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very kind. I just want to go home and relax. I hope the tests don’t take too long. I’m a little tired.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. We’ll do our best to get the results back as quickly as possible. It shouldn't take too long. Please let me know when the results are available. And in the meantime, please make Zoie and Sione comfortable. Okay, Zoie, let’s get those tests ordered. We’ll get you taken care of as quickly as possible. And don’t worry, we’ll figure out what’s going on. I'll be right back after the assistant gets you set up. Let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Let’s get this over with, dear.
