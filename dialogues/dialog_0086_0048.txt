DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Lason, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Colt Lason. And please, Doctor… Murtić, is it? Don’t bother with the “Mr.” I’ve earned the right to be just Colt.
DOCTOR: Very well, Colt. I prefer to maintain a degree of professionalism, but… alright. So, Colt, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… difficult to explain. My wife, Sophy, she's been on my back about it, truth be told. I’ve been… losing my place, you could say. Not lost lost, mind you. More like… a fog rolls in. I know what I was doing, then… poof. A few minutes gone, and I have to ask Sophy what happened. It’s mostly at home, thankfully. Don’t need that nonsense at work. I set tiles, Doctor. Precision is everything. You can't be forgetting things when you’re working with stone.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory lapses. And this is primarily occurring at home, you say?
PATIENT: Mostly. Though, last week at the hardware store… I went for grout, specifically beige grout, the kind we used for the Andersons’ bathroom. And I came home with… red. Bright red! Sophy nearly had a fit. Said I was losing it. I know I had beige in my head, I just… didn’t end up with it. It’s frustrating, honestly. I've always had a good memory for things like colours, patterns… the way a stone sits. It's not like I'm senile, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, these episodes… how often would you say they occur?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s… hard to say exactly. Maybe… twice a week? Sometimes three times. It’s not every day, thankfully. And they don't always involve forgetting something important. Sometimes I just… wander off mid-sentence. Sophy says I stare off into space. It’s embarrassing, really. Like my mind is somewhere else entirely. It's been getting worse over the past few months, I think. Definitely more frequent.
DOCTOR: And apart from the memory issues and… wandering, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… Well, Sophy says I’m more irritable. I snap at her for no reason. I don’t mean to, but… things just get on my nerves more easily. And I sleep… terribly. Toss and turn all night. Used to be a sound sleeper. Now, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept a wink. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. They're just… on the tip of my tongue. It’s very annoying. Though, that could just be old age.
DOCTOR: Irritability, sleep disturbance, difficulty with word-finding… Right. And you said these symptoms have been worsening over the past few months?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Slow and steady, getting worse. Sophy keeps asking if I’m depressed or something, but I'm not sad, you understand? Just… frustrated. And tired. Mostly tired. I work hard, always have. Physical labor. That's good for a man. Keeps the mind sharp, usually. But lately… it feels like it’s wearing me down, not building me up. It's unsettling. Like a machine losing its oil, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But I manage it. Take my pills, watch my salt. Nothing major. And I had my prostate checked annually, standard for a man my age. Everything always came back fine. Aside from that, I've always been a pretty healthy man. Strong as an ox, Sophy says. Until recently, that is. I've never been in the hospital for anything serious, if that's what you're asking. I believe in hard work and fresh air, that's what keeps a man going. Not sitting around taking pills.
DOCTOR: You mentioned blood pressure medication. What are you currently taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril, I think. 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with breakfast. Sophy handles the refills, mostly. She's very good with that sort of thing. I just take what she gives me. Been taking it for… oh, five or six years now, maybe? It keeps the numbers down, the doctor said. Though, sometimes I forget to take it if I’m busy. Just a little thing. I usually remember eventually. Don’t want to get too technical with me, Doctor, I'm a tile man, not a pharmacist.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Sophy’s always asking if I’ve ever had a reaction to anything, but I haven’t. I eat everything. Love a good Khmer curry. Never had any trouble with shellfish, peanuts, nothing. Always been able to stomach anything, really. Though, sometimes my stomach gets upset if I eat too much spicy food. That's just a bit of indigestion, nothing serious. I’ve always had a strong constitution, as I said. Can handle most things. I just want to figure out what’s happening with my head, you know? Not with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents passed away a long time ago. Both of them. They lived in Cambodia their whole lives. Didn’t have much in the way of… fancy medical care. My mother, she had a weak heart, I think. Passed away in her sixties. My father… just old age, mostly. He was a rice farmer. Worked hard his whole life. As for siblings… I had one sister, but we lost contact with her after the… troubles. Never really knew much about her health. It's not something we talked about, even before… well, never mind. Not a lot of medical knowledge in my family, Doctor. Mostly just hard work and early graves. It’s not like we had time for doctors.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Tried it once when I was younger, a foolish thing to do. Didn't like it. Alcohol… I have a beer with dinner sometimes. A small one. Doesn’t bother me. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never been interested. I work hard for a living. I don’t need anything to… dull my senses. Never had any use for that sort of thing. Sophy wouldn't approve either, and she’s the one I listen to. A good man takes care of himself and his family, not wasting time on foolishness. Besides, my hands are too important to risk anything like that. A tile man needs steady hands.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Go ahead. I haven’t got anything to hide. Though I suspect my blood pressure will be a little high. I was a bit anxious driving over here, thinking about all of this. And honestly, Doctor, I’m a practical man. If something is broken, you fix it. Just tell me what you find, and let’s get it sorted. I’ve got tiles to lay, you know. People are waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 160 over 95. As expected. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your gait is slightly unsteady. Balance is… passable. Now, I’d like to perform a quick cognitive assessment, a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. Questions are fine. I’m a practical man, I can handle a few questions. Though I suspect this is all just a waste of time. I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s just a bit of forgetfulness. Old age, maybe. Happens to the best of us. I’m still perfectly capable of laying a beautiful tile floor. That’s what matters, isn't it? Practical skills. Not… whatever it is you’re looking for. But go ahead, ask your questions. I’ll answer them as best as I can. Just don't expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me think… It's… August. August 2nd. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I remember Sophy telling me. She always reminds me of important dates. Though I don't know why I needed to know it, personally. Doesn't change the price of grout, does it?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you spell the word “world”?
PATIENT: “World”… W-O-R-L-D. Yes, W-O-R-L-D. Perfectly simple. I read the newspaper every morning, you know. Keep up with current events. Though I mostly look at the pictures, truth be told. Words aren’t as important as seeing what’s happening. A good tile man needs to be aware of his surroundings. Knowing how to spell "world" doesn’t exactly help me lay a perfect floor, though. Still, I can spell it. W-O-R-L-D. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, easy. Apple, table, penny. I remember them perfectly. It's not like you're asking me to calculate the square root of pi or something. Those are just simple words. Apple, table, penny. What now? Are we getting somewhere? This is all a bit of a bother, you know. I have a deadline to meet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you subtract 7 from 100?
PATIENT: Subtract 7 from 100… hmm. Let me think. 100… take away 7… That would be… 93. Yes, 93. I might be a tile man, but I'm not a complete idiot, you know. I can still do a bit of basic arithmetic. Though I leave the complicated calculations to Sophy. She's the smart one. 93. Is that what you wanted to hear? Can we be done soon? My hands are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. One last question. Can you tell me who is the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: The… the President? Oh, dear. Now, see, that's… that's a tricky one. I try not to pay much attention to politics, you understand? It just causes unnecessary stress. It’s… I think it’s… Biden. Yes, Biden. Joe Biden. Is that right? Honestly, Doctor, I'm much better at laying tiles than reciting names of politicians. Doesn’t change the fact I can lay a beautiful floor. But yes, I believe it’s Biden. Please, can we move on now? This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. I have a few preliminary findings. Your blood pressure is elevated, and your cognitive assessment shows some… deficiencies. You had difficulty recalling the current President and your performance on the simple memory tasks was less than optimal. Based on this initial assessment, I suspect you may be experiencing some early signs of cognitive impairment. However, this is just a preliminary opinion. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions and I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation by a specialist. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment? Specialist? Blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I just thought it was a bit of forgetfulness, Doctor. A bit of age creeping in. I don't feel impaired. I can still do my job, still lay a beautiful tile floor. Are you saying I’m… losing my mind? Sophy is going to be furious. She already thinks I’m getting too old. Blood tests… and a specialist… What if it is something serious? What if I can't… keep working? That’s all I’ve ever known. I just want to keep laying tiles. Is that too much to ask? What kind of blood tests? And… and what does a "comprehensive neurological evaluation" involve? Please, just tell me plainly. No complicated medical jargon. I just want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Let’s take this one step at a time. “Cognitive impairment” is a broad term. It simply means there’s a decline in your mental abilities – memory, thinking, reasoning. It doesn't necessarily mean you're "losing your mind," as you put it. There are many possible causes, and often it's treatable. The blood tests are routine. We’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, blood sugar, kidney and liver function. Just basic things to rule out any underlying medical problems that could be affecting your cognitive function. The neurological evaluation involves a more detailed assessment of your memory, thinking, and physical reflexes. The specialist will ask you questions, perform some tests, and may order some imaging scans, like an MRI or CT scan, of your brain. It’s a thorough examination to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m ordering a complete blood panel, and I will give you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist in the city. She’s very good. It’s better to be proactive and get this checked out. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Blood tests, referral to a neurologist… Dr. Sharma… MRI scans… It sounds… overwhelming. So, it could be something treatable? It's not necessarily… the end of the road? I just… I rely on my hands, you see? My ability to think clearly. Tile setting requires precision, concentration… If I can't do that… Alright. I’ll get the blood tests done. I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Sharma. But honestly, Doctor… I’m scared. Sophy will be furious if she finds out I'm going to a specialist. She'll start talking about assisted living and… and all sorts of things. Can we… can we keep this quiet for now? Until we know something definite? I just want to get this sorted out without causing a panic. I still have floors to lay. I still have a reputation to uphold. Please, Doctor. Can we just… take it one step at a time? And keep it confidential for now? I'd really appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. I understand your concerns. I will keep the referral confidential for now. However, I must inform you that if I determine your condition poses an immediate risk to your health or the health of others, I am legally obligated to share that information with the appropriate authorities. Beyond that, the matter is between you and Dr. Sharma. But I do urge you to be honest with Sophy. Keeping her in the dark will only create more problems in the long run. I will write you a referral to Dr. Sharma and a lab order for the blood tests. The results should be back in a few days. You can schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma at your convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And for keeping it confidential for now. I appreciate that. I'll get the blood tests done as soon as possible. And… and I'll try to talk to Sophy. Eventually. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I hope I can still lay tiles. That's all I ask. Thank you again, Doctor Murtić. I’ll see myself out. .
