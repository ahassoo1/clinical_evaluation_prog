DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They asked me to get a note from my doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. A pre-participation form for the cruise. Certainly. To complete this accurately, I'll need to gather some information from you. Let’s start with a brief overview of your current health. Are you experiencing any medical issues at present?
PATIENT: Not as such, no. I’ve been quite well, thankfully. A bit of aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing that stops me from getting on with things. I walk every day, you see, and I manage my own garden. Keeps me busy. Would you like me to list any past illnesses, just in case?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re active. Yes, please do. Knowing your medical history is important, even if things seem fine now. We’ll cover past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and any medications you take. If you’re unsure of dates, approximations are perfectly fine. Let’s start with past illnesses. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, asthma, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Back in… oh, it must have been 1988, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia. Spent a week in the hospital, I did. And… and when I was a wee girl, I had scarlet fever, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve always been lucky with my health. No heart trouble, no sugar problems, and I’ve never had any trouble breathing. I did have a bad case of the flu last winter, but that’s hardly a significant illness, is it?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia in 1988 and scarlet fever as a child. Thank you. And you mentioned the flu last winter. Did that require a doctor’s visit?
PATIENT: Yes, it did. I saw Dr. MacIntyre – he’s retired now, poor man. I had a terrible fever and a cough that wouldn't quit. He gave me something for it, though. A syrup, I believe. It did the trick, eventually. I was bedridden for nearly a week, it was dreadful. I don’t usually get sick, so it knocked me for six, it did. I’d rather not repeat that experience, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unpleasant. Now, regarding surgeries… have you ever undergone any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, as a matter of fact. Back in 1995, I had my gallbladder removed. It was quite a simple operation, all things considered. I was in the hospital for only a few days, and I recovered very quickly. Dr. Henderson did it. A very nice man, although a bit quiet. And… oh, and I had my wisdom teeth out when I was young, of course. But that hardly counts, does it? It was a very long time ago. I believe that’s all the surgeries I’ve had. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal in 1995, wisdom teeth extraction. Good. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… let me think carefully. No, I don’t believe so. I've never had a reaction to any medication that I’m aware of. I eat most things, although I don’t care for shellfish much, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. And thankfully, bees don’t bother me, and I haven’t ever been stung badly. I think I’m quite lucky, really. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat and what I touch, I suppose. Old habits, you know.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take a paracetamol for a headache, if I have one, but that's about it. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you see. And I don't really trust all those herbal remedies – too many unknowns, if you ask me. Just paracetamol for a headache now and then, that’s all. I pride myself on being drug-free, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Knowing if any close relatives have had significant medical problems can be helpful. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a bit of a sad topic, to be honest. My mother… she passed away from cancer, many years ago. Lung cancer, it was. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end of his life. He had a stroke, you see. My brother… well, he’s quite healthy, thankfully. Never had a day’s illness in his life, if I’m honest. My grandparents… I don’t really know much about their health, to be fair. They passed away when I was very young. It’s not a very cheerful subject, is it? But I’m happy to tell you what I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Squiers. It's helpful, and I understand it's not always easy to talk about. Lung cancer in your mother and heart disease in your father. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I don't mind at all. I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I appreciate a thorough check-up. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual, you see. I'm quite a sensible woman, and I can handle bad news, if there is any. Go ahead, then. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d be so kind as to step on the scale for me first, please. And then we can proceed with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. 109 pounds. And your height is 171 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. 171 centimeters, as far as I know. I haven't been measured in years, to be honest, but I believe that's right. I used to be taller, I think, but I've shrunk a little with age, I suppose. Go ahead with the rest of the check-up when you’re ready, Doctor. I’m quite comfortable.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 132 over 78. Within normal limits. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you'll please take a deep breath for me... Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Everything appears within normal limits so far, Ms. Squiers. Do you have any pain anywhere at present?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Not a bit of pain. A few aches and creaks, as I mentioned before, but nothing that would cause me any concern. It's just old age, I suppose. I've always been very careful about looking after myself, you see. I'm a very active woman, as you know, and I eat a healthy diet. Now and then, my knees get a bit stiff, especially in cold weather, but it passes quickly enough. But that’s hardly pain, is it? I'm quite a robust woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Knees a bit stiff in cold weather. Alright. And finally, I'll just check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Everything appears within normal limits. Given your medical history and the findings of this exam, I don't see any contraindications to your cruise. I can certainly provide a note stating that you are medically cleared to travel.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! I’m so relieved to hear that. That was my main concern, you see, making sure I was fit enough to enjoy the trip. I’ve been looking forward to it for months, and I’d be terribly disappointed if I couldn’t go. Thank you so much for taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. It’s put my mind completely at ease. How long will it take to get the note, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Squiers. This note states that you are in good general health and medically cleared for travel. It also summarizes the information we discussed today – your past medical history, current medications, and the findings of the physical exam. It does mention that you occasionally experience stiffness in your knees, particularly in cold weather, and advises you to take appropriate measures to manage that.
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor. This is exactly what the cruise line required. Yes, it’s all here… past illnesses, no allergies, occasional knee stiffness… excellent. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I go on the cruise? Any particular precautions I should take?
DOCTOR: Given your history, I recommend staying well-hydrated throughout your trip, especially in warmer climates. And as you mentioned the occasional knee stiffness, consider bringing a mild over-the-counter pain reliever, like paracetamol, just in case. It’s also a good idea to be mindful of food safety while traveling and avoid consuming any potentially contaminated water or food. And, of course, protect yourself from the sun. Finally, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms during your cruise – such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that’s all very sensible advice, Doctor. I always stay hydrated, and I'm very careful about what I eat and drink. And I certainly wouldn’t hesitate to seek medical attention if I needed it. I'm a practical woman, and I know my limits. Actually… now that I think about it, I don’t have any travel insurance. Would you recommend I get some before I go? I haven’t really thought about it before.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Ms. Squiers. I strongly recommend obtaining travel insurance before your cruise. It can provide coverage for unexpected medical expenses, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and other unforeseen circumstances. Given your age and medical history, it's even more important to have that financial protection. There are many different insurance providers available, so I suggest researching your options and choosing a policy that meets your specific needs. I can’t recommend a specific provider, as that would be a conflict of interest, but a quick online search for “travel insurance” will give you plenty of choices. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions, Doctor. I feel much more confident about going on the cruise now, knowing I'm medically fit and having a plan in place. Thank you again for your time and thoroughness. You've been a great help. I really appreciate it. Is there anything I need to do before I leave – sign anything, pay a fee…?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. There's just a standard co-pay for the office visit, which the receptionist will handle on your way out. No other paperwork is required. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! And if you do encounter any issues while traveling, please don't hesitate to contact your primary care physician upon your return. Safe travels!
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. I will certainly do that. And I will definitely let you know all about it when I get back. Goodbye, and thank you again for everything.
