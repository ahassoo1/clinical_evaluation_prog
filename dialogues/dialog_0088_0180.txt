DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like a crazy person, but… I gotta have some. Clay, mostly. Don't look at me like that. It just… helps. I don't know why, okay? My husband… he used to make fun of me. But he's… gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I understand. Tiredness is very common, and we can definitely look into that. And… you mentioned eating clay. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? I just… feel weak. And then I crave it. Red clay, usually. Sometimes the stuff from the garden, but not if they put chemicals on it. I… I don’t know how long this has been going on. A while. Before… everything. It's not like I'm shoveling it down, but a little handful here, a little there. Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. A handful… several times a week, would you say?
PATIENT: Several? Maybe. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends. When I'm really… drained. Look, does it matter how much? Is this some kinda… judge-y thing? Because I already said I don't do it on purpose! It just… settles something. I don't know. I just want to feel normal again. And less tired! Is there a pill for that? A quick one?
DOCTOR: No, Hedy, this isn’t about judging you at all. I need to understand what’s going on so I can help you feel better. Eating clay can sometimes indicate a vitamin deficiency, or even a condition called pica. It's important we rule things out. Could you tell me about any other cravings you might have?
PATIENT: Cravings? Other than dirt? What kinda question is that? Look, I'm a simple woman. I like my coffee strong and… well, dirt. I haven't been craving anything else. Not really. Maybe… ice sometimes. But everyone likes ice! I don’t need a fancy list of things I want to eat. I just want to stop feeling like I’m dragging myself through mud, and stop needing the dirt, okay? This is ridiculous. Is this gonna involve blood tests? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay. No judgment, I promise. Ice cravings can be related, and it’s good you mentioned that. Yes, I think some blood work would be helpful, just to check your iron levels and other vitamins. And we'll need to talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh… well, my appendix. Years ago. Before… everything. And… I had a bad infection once, in my foot. That's about it. Never been diagnosed with anything, really. Just… tired. Always tired. My husband, he used to say I was lazy. He didn’t understand. He worked at the factory, all day. Always had energy. I… look, just do the blood test, okay? Get it over with. And then tell me what pill to take. I don’t have time for stories. It's August 2nd, by the way. Don't forget that.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a foot infection. Noted. August 2nd, checked. We'll get the blood work ordered right away. While we're waiting for the results, let's go through a quick review of your systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What are you, a plumber? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, okay? Sometimes it's normal, sometimes it's… not. What does that even matter? This is getting ridiculous. I just eat dirt and feel tired. That's the whole story! I don't need a whole life history. Honestly. And I really hate needles. Is there any way we can skip the blood test? I'm a perfectly healthy woman… except for the dirt and the tiredness. You wouldn't believe how much I get done even with being tired. Just… find me a pill. Please.
DOCTOR: Hedy, I understand your frustration, and I’m not trying to pry. But sometimes seemingly unrelated things can be connected. Changes in bowel habits can indicate a vitamin absorption problem, which could be related to the clay eating and the tiredness. It's important to rule things out. And to be clear, I’m not dismissing you or your concerns. I want to help you find a solution, and that starts with getting some information. The blood test will help me figure out if there's a simple explanation, like an iron deficiency. If you're really anxious about it, we can talk about numbing cream to minimize the discomfort. Would that help?
PATIENT: Ugh. Numbing cream? Is that even real? Look, I don't do well with… things. Needles, doctors, long questions. Everything. And I really don’t like having my blood taken. It makes me dizzy. Fine. Do the blood test. But if I faint, it's on you. And… can we please just hurry? It's hot in here. I think I need a glass of water. I haven't had water all day. And seriously, if this involves explaining my life story, I'm walking out. I told you, I eat dirt and I'm tired. That's it. August 2nd, remember. I don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. We’ll get the nurse right away, and she can draw your blood. We can apply numbing cream first, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable. And we won’t go into a long life story, I promise. Just a few basic questions to get a clearer picture. I'll also get you a glass of water right away. August 2nd is noted. It’s important we’re all on the same page. Now, before the nurse arrives, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I don’t take medications. I don’t like pills! That's why I'm here! I don’t want to be on a bunch of… drugs. I just want to feel normal again. Maybe… I take something for my arthritis sometimes. But it doesn’t really help. It's just… a little bottle. Pink. I don't remember the name. My daughter used to get it for me. She’s… busy now. Look, just get the nurse. I need a glass of water. And I'm really starting to feel faint. Seriously. August 2nd. Don't forget. I'm a simple woman. Dirt, tiredness, and now a headache. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I’ve called the nurse. It sounds like you take something for arthritis occasionally, a pink bottle, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! Pink. Small bottle. I keep it in the kitchen. With the… the spices. Look, is the nurse going to ask me a million questions? Because if she does, I'm leaving. I need to get home. I have things to do. I don’t understand why everyone is making such a big deal about dirt and tiredness. It's not like I'm… sick, sick. Just… low energy. And I crave clay. And I'm tired. August 2nd. Please. Can we just hurry? And is it hot in here, or is it just me? I think I'm gonna need a fan. A big fan.
DOCTOR: The nurse will just need a few basic details, Hedy. We want to make sure we have all the information to provide the best care. And yes, it is quite warm in here, I’ll have someone adjust the thermostat. I promise we’ll get through this as quickly and comfortably as possible. One last quick question, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? What kinda question is that now? Look, I wear sandals. Always sandals. You can’t really see swelling in sandals, can you? Maybe a little, sometimes, at the end of the day. But that’s just… normal. I’m a woman. We swell. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want a pill to make me less tired and stop craving dirt. Is that too much to ask? August 2nd. Don't forget. Seriously. And where is that nurse? This is making my headache worse. I need water. And a fan. And a pill. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. Nurse Ramirez is here now. She’s going to start by checking your blood pressure and taking a little blood for the tests. And I’ve already asked someone to bring you a glass of water and adjust the thermostat. Nurse Ramirez, Hedy is feeling a little tired and has been craving clay, and has mentioned some occasional swelling in her ankles. She’s also concerned about a headache. We’ll get you feeling better as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… don’t stick the needle in too deep. And hurry. Seriously. This whole thing is making me feel even worse. Dirt, tiredness, headache, swelling… it's a never-ending story. And August 2nd. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. Important things. Don't forget. Please. I'm a simple woman. It's all very simple. Just… a pill. That's all I want. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. We’ll take good care of you. Just relax, and let me know if you feel anything unusual. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible and discuss a plan to help you feel better. .
