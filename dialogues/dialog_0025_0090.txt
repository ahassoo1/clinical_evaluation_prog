DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…Mackenzi Brightful, yes. Um, well, I’m here for a check-up before a surgery. A cosmetic one, that is. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy…it’s been a difficult time, and things haven’t been easy to keep straight. I believe my…consultant suggested I needed clearance first?
DOCTOR: A cosmetic surgery, alright. And you need medical clearance. That's… sensible, I suppose. "Fuzzy details," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s a good way to put it. It's not that I can’t remember, exactly…it’s more like…the memories aren’t very…vivid. It was some time ago that I made the arrangements, and a lot has happened since then. My husband…passed away. It’s been…a while, but it still feels very recent, if that makes any sense. I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent loss. That certainly explains some things. Though, frankly, a cosmetic procedure after such a loss…well. Still, not my place to judge. Let’s try to piece things together. You said you need clearance for surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. I… believe it has something to do with my face? Perhaps… something to do with lifting? Or tightening? I’m so sorry, Doctor. It was recommended by a… specialist, a very nice woman, but I wasn’t really in the right headspace to focus on the specifics when I booked it. It felt important at the time… a way to feel… better, I suppose. Would my insurance have a record of it?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Brightful… August 2nd, 2025… Hmm. Yes, here we are. “Consultation with Dr. Evelyn Reed – Facial Aesthetics.” Appointment was… January 15th of this year. Procedure scheduled for… September 8th. It’s listed as a “Mid-Facelift and Lower Rhytidectomy.” Rhytidectomy is just a fancy word for facelift, dear. Now, that’s helpful. And you've been… managing on your own since January?
PATIENT: Oh! A mid-facelift and… a lower rhytidectomy. Yes, that sounds… right. Dr. Reed was very kind. And yes…managing on my own since January. It’s been… difficult. I have a neighbor who checks on me, thankfully. She’s a good woman, but I haven't wanted to burden her too much. It's just…a lot. I suppose I should have asked someone for help with all of this paperwork and… everything. I’m terribly sorry to be such a bother, Doctor. Is that… a lot to have scheduled at once?
DOCTOR: “A lot”?
PATIENT: I… apologize. It probably seems silly. I just… I haven't been very good at keeping things organized lately. And the grief… it makes it harder to think clearly sometimes. I didn't realize it was such a big procedure when I scheduled it, truthfully. It just felt like… something I needed to do. I feel awful for wasting your time with my… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: "Forgetfulness" isn't the issue here, Ms. Brightful. It's a rather extensive surgery, scheduled several months ago, and you're presenting with a…distinct lack of preparation. A responsible patient would have a clear understanding of the procedure, potential risks, and post-operative care. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. You’re right, of course. I should have been more prepared. I just… I let things slip. It’s all a bit of a blur, as I’ve said. Pre-existing conditions… let me think. I believe I’m generally healthy. My husband always said I was stubborn about going to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I… I don’t have diabetes, I don't think. And my blood pressure was usually quite good, though it may have been elevated recently, with everything that's happened. I had a bit of trouble with my heart palpitations a few years back, but that resolved on its own, the doctor said. Nothing major, I don't think. Would my records have that information? I'm so sorry to be such a handful.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… No history of diabetes or hypertension documented. Palpitations noted in 2021 – attributed to stress, resolved spontaneously. No further follow-up. Hmm. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was very young, and I didn’t know my father. I had a brother, Mateo, but we weren’t very close. He… lived in Bogotá. I believe he had some issues with his heart, but I don’t know the specifics. I'm afraid I don't have much information on that side of the family. It wasn’t something we discussed much, even before… everything. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. It’s just… a lot of this feels very distant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, with all due respect, this is… concerning. You’re scheduled for a significant surgical procedure, and you can't readily recall important medical details, even with recent documentation. We need a clearer picture of your overall health before proceeding. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: I… I do take something for my anxiety. Just a small dose, prescribed by my primary care physician after my husband… passed. It's… Escitalopram, I think. Ten milligrams. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s just as needed. I also take a multivitamin, just a basic one, and… sometimes fish oil for my joints. That’s it, I think. Really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if that makes sense. I'm so sorry if I'm not providing enough information, Doctor. I'm just trying to remember everything. It’s been a long time since I've been asked so many questions about my health.
DOCTOR: Escitalopram 10mg, ibuprofen PRN, multivitamin, fish oil. Alright. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think I have any major allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to food, and I don’t recall any issues with… pollen or anything like that. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but I don't think that's a true allergy. More of an… irritation, perhaps. Nothing serious, I assure you. Is it possible to be tested for allergies, just to be safe? I wouldn't want to cause any problems during the surgery.
DOCTOR: “Irritation” is not the same as an allergy, Ms. Brightful. But alright. We’ll make a note of potential sensitivity to cats. Now, let’s get to a physical exam. I need to assess your overall health status before even considering clearance for this surgery. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I… I apologize again for all of this. I feel like I'm making your job very difficult. I just want to be sure everything is safe.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… That's… a BMI of 61. Ms. Brightful, you are significantly overweight. Now, please step back and we'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I am aware of my weight, Doctor. It’s been difficult to manage, especially lately. Grief… it does things to a person. I haven’t been eating well, and I haven’t been very active. I understand that it’s not ideal. Please, proceed with the examination. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Elevated. Heart rate is 88, slightly rapid. I hear a mild murmur, but it’s faint. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are slightly diminished. Ms. Brightful, your weight and blood pressure are concerning. And the murmur… we need to investigate that further. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. I… I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so this is probably a good thing, honestly. A little frightening, but… good. Please, proceed with the reflex test. I’ll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Ms. Brightful, based on this initial examination, there are several red flags. Your weight, elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur… these all need to be addressed before we can even consider granting clearance for a major surgical procedure. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. We'll also need a referral to a cardiologist to evaluate the murmur.
PATIENT: I… I see. That’s… a lot. I understand, Doctor. You’re right, of course. It wouldn’t be safe. I just… I was hoping to get this surgery done. It felt important, like… a fresh start. But you’re right. Safety comes first. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Please, let me know when I can schedule those tests. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being honest with me.
DOCTOR: It's my job, Ms. Brightful. And frankly, pushing forward with this surgery in your current condition would be irresponsible. We need to get a clearer picture of your overall health first. I’ll have my nurse schedule those tests for you. In the meantime, I recommend you start focusing on a healthier diet and incorporating some light exercise into your routine. It won’t be easy, but it’s crucial. And I'm referring you to Dr. Ramirez, a cardiologist, for a full evaluation. I’m also going to write a temporary hold on the surgery until we have the results of these tests and a clearance from Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I… I just need to process everything. Thank you again. And… please let me know how to reach Dr. Ramirez’s office. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. I suppose this means… I’ll have to postpone the surgery indefinitely?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean indefinitely, Ms. Brightful. It means we need to prioritize your health first. Once we address these concerns, we can revisit the possibility of surgery. But right now, rushing into it would be dangerous. Here’s Dr. Ramirez’s contact information. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with a list of resources for healthy eating and exercise. This is a setback, yes. But it’s also an opportunity to take care of yourself. And that's the most important thing. Please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: .
