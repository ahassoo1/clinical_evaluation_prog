DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been… well, a while now. Honestly, I don’t even remember when it started, but my daughter, bless her heart, she kept nagging me to come in. She says it’s getting worse. I just want a quick fix, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. I appreciate you coming in, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to get it checked out. “A while now” is helpful, but could you try to recall roughly when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, doc, my memory ain't what it used to be. Probably… last year? Maybe the year before? It's hard to say. Everything kinda blurs together after a while, you know? I was a busy man, always working. Producing, directing… important stuff. Didn’t have time to notice little things like a tremor. It didn’t bother me then, not really. Now, it makes a mess of my coffee. That’s a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Baide. It’s common for things to seem less distinct as time goes on, and it’s perfectly alright if you can’t pinpoint an exact date. The fact that it's now interfering with daily activities, like enjoying your coffee, is a good reason to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… jitters. My hand just… moves. When I try to hold something, it’s like it has a mind of its own. Especially when I’m trying to be… precise. You know, like signing something, or… using a fork. It’s not constant, mind you. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times it’s… well, embarrassing. My daughter says it's worse when I'm stressed, but I'm always stressed. What with everything going on in the world… Honestly, it's probably just old age. Is that what this is, doc? Old age?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the shaking varies in intensity and is more pronounced with certain activities and perhaps with stress. It’s good you’ve noticed those patterns. While it could be related to age, there are many potential causes for tremors, and it's important to rule out other possibilities before attributing it to simply aging. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask some further questions, if that’s alright. We'll start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… That’s a long list, probably. I was a healthy man, mostly. High blood pressure, they told me, years ago. Took some pills for it. Stopped taking them, eventually. Didn't like the side effects. And… I had my prostate acting up, but they fixed that with a little… procedure. Other than that? Nothing major. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, what you’d expect from a man my age. My wife… bless her soul… she took care of most of the doctor stuff. I never really paid much attention. Does it matter? All this digging…is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, but knowing your medical history, even the things you feel aren’t major, is very important. It helps me understand the bigger picture and rule out potential causes for your shaking. High blood pressure and the prostate procedure are helpful to know. Do you recall the name of the medication you took for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was a little white pill. They all look the same to me. I took it for a while, then my wife started complaining about the cost, and the doctor said it was fine to stop if it wasn’t bothering me. Look, I'm telling you, I wasn't one for remembering medications or doctors' names. I was a producer, a director! I made things happen, I didn’t sit around worrying about pills. Is this going somewhere, doc? Or are we just going to rehash my entire life?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the medication name. We can certainly move on. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the prostate procedure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. Maybe a tonsillectomy when I was a kid? But that was ages ago. Honestly, doc, I’ve been pretty lucky. I avoided the hospital as much as possible. Too many germs. And… frankly, I never liked doctors much. Always poking and prodding. Is this getting us anywhere? I feel like we’re going in circles. Can we just get to the bottom of this shaking and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get straight to the point, Mr. Baide. We are making progress. Knowing you’ve had a tonsillectomy and haven’t had any other major surgeries is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—who experienced tremors or any other neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson's? Good lord, no. My family was… sturdy. Farmers, mostly. Built like brick houses. My father… he was a strong man, worked the land until he was 90. My mother… she was Italian, you know? They don’t get sick easily. A little arthritis, maybe. But nothing like… shaking. Honestly, doc, I think this is just nerves. I’ve got a lot on my mind, a lot of… responsibility. My daughter worries too much. It's probably just stress. Can we please just wrap this up? I have a meeting later. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your desire to get this resolved quickly, Mr. Baide. It’s good to know your family doesn't have a history of tremors or neurological conditions. To continue, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I… I live comfortably. I have a nice house, a good view. I watch TV, I read the paper. I used to travel a lot, but not so much anymore. Honestly, I mostly just try to stay out of trouble. I drink a little wine with dinner. Italian wine, naturally. And I smoke… well, I used to smoke. Quit a few years ago. It wasn't good for me. Look, doc, I'm a retired producer. I don't exactly live a wild life. Is this really relevant? I just want to know what's causing this shaking and what we can do about it. I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. Knowing about your past smoking and moderate wine consumption is helpful, and it’s good you quit smoking. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. You mentioned stopping your blood pressure medication, but are you taking anything else regularly?
