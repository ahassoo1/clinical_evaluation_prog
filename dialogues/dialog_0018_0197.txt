DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be blunt, I need a card so I can keep driving. I drive people around sometimes, you see, and I need the proper license to do that legally. A ride-share thing, or taxi… commercial driver, is that right? I want to make sure I’m all set. I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible if we could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. You’re seeking a medical certification to obtain a commercial driver’s license – often referred to as a CDL – and require a physical examination to ensure you meet the necessary health standards. I can certainly assist with that. To begin, let’s gather some information. First, could you please confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: April 12th, 1955. I remember dates very well, you see. It’s the names I forget sometimes! But dates… no problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. And to clarify, you are currently driving passengers for hire – is this a formal ride-sharing service, or are you providing transportation more independently?
PATIENT: A bit of both, really. I do some pickups for a smaller app, not one of the big ones, and sometimes I just help neighbors or people I know. Nothing official, mostly just keeping busy and making a little extra money. It’s important to me to stay active, you see. I don’t want to sit around doing nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Staying active is very important. We’ll ensure we cover everything necessary for the CDL requirements, regardless of the specific arrangement. Now, I’d like to go through a detailed medical history. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed about fifteen years ago. But it’s well-controlled with medication now. My doctor in the city, Dr. Yamamoto, manages it. Otherwise… nothing major. I had a bad knee a few years back, needed a replacement, but that was successful. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Do you need Dr. Yamamoto's information? I have it with me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Yes, if you wouldn’t mind providing Dr. Yamamoto's contact information, that would be very helpful. It allows me to verify details and ensure continuity of care. And thank you for being so thorough. Now, regarding your knee replacement – when was that surgery performed, and have you had any complications or ongoing issues with it since?
PATIENT: It was… November 18th, 2019. I remember because it was right before Thanksgiving. And no, no complications at all! It was a really good surgeon, very skilled. Some soreness after a long day of driving, sometimes, but nothing I can’t manage with a little stretching and over-the-counter pain relief. I have full range of motion, and it doesn’t bother me too much. Really, it’s better than it was before, to be honest. I was in a lot of pain before the surgery, you see. Do you need the name of the surgeon? I can give you that too.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mrs. Sciarrotta. A successful knee replacement is very encouraging. Yes, if you could provide the surgeon's name, that would be appreciated. Now, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking. You mentioned medication for your blood pressure – could you please list all of the medications you take, including the dosages, if you know them?
PATIENT: Alright. Let me see… For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I also take a Vitamin D supplement, 2000 IU, just because the doctor said my levels were a little low. That’s it. Just those two things. I don't like taking a lot of pills, you see. I try to stay as natural as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Vitamin D supplementation is quite common. And I understand your preference for minimizing medication use. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to anything I’m aware of, at least. I’ve eaten everything and been everywhere, you see. I used to travel a lot with my husband, before he passed away, and I never had any reactions to anything. So, no, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way too. Do you need to know about any past surgeries besides the knee? I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and no problems with that either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Sciarrotta. A history of gallbladder removal is helpful to note. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother had heart disease, unfortunately. She passed away when she was 85. My father had high blood pressure, like me, but he lived to be 92, so it didn’t bother him too much. And my brother has diabetes, type 2. Other than that… not really. My family was pretty healthy overall, you see. They all lived long lives. Do you need to know about my husband's family? He had a sister who had some issues with her eyesight, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Sciarrotta. That information is helpful. Now, just a few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while when he was younger, but he quit years ago. I always told him it was a terrible habit, you see. I’ve always been very careful about my health.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy, you see. Just a small glass to relax. I don’t drink to excess, I promise. It helps me unwind after a long day of driving.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me if you are currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms that are concerning to you?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little stiffness in my knees sometimes, like I said, but nothing I can’t manage. And maybe a little tired after a long drive, but that’s just from being on the road for hours, you see. Nothing serious. I feel pretty good overall, all things considered. I'm a practical woman, Doctor. If something was really bothering me, I'd say so. I'm just trying to get this done as quickly as possible if we could. I have a few appointments later today.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty and practicality, Mrs. Sciarrotta. And I certainly understand your time constraints. Now, let’s proceed with the physical examination. I will need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your heart and lungs, examine your vision, and assess your neurological function. Finally, I’ll briefly examine your musculoskeletal system, paying particular attention to your knees. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Just get it over with, please. I'm a bit impatient, you see. I'm more of a "get to the point" kind of woman. The quicker we get this done, the better. I appreciate you being efficient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Let’s get started. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72 and regular, your respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath for me… Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I’ll check your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… um… H… K… P… um… F… 7… 4… Oh, and B… Yeah, I can read those. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you see, but it's still good enough for driving. I wear glasses, of course, for long distances. But I can still see pretty well close up. I just need a little help with the small print sometimes. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. We’ll note that you require corrective lenses for distance vision. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There you go. Easy enough. My husband always said I had good reflexes, you see. He used to joke I could spot a bargain a mile away. I’m still pretty sharp for my age, I think. Are we getting close to the end now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close, Mrs. Sciarrotta. You’re doing very well. Finally, let's examine your knees. Could you please bend them for me, and let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit of stiffness there. Not really pain, but it's not as smooth as it used to be. Feels a bit tight, you know? Like I said, it's better than it was before the replacement, but it's not perfect. There's a little bit of clicking too, I suppose. It doesn't bother me much when I'm driving, but I can feel it when I bend them like this. Is that okay? I'm just being honest with you, Doctor. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I appreciate it. I’m feeling some mild crepitus in both knees, which is common after a knee replacement. There’s no significant tenderness, and your range of motion is within acceptable limits. Alright, that completes the physical examination. Based on my assessment, you are in generally good health. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you require corrective lenses for distance vision. We'll need to address those things.
PATIENT: So... what does that mean? Am I cleared to drive? Can I get my card? I really need to know. I have people relying on me, you see. And I don't want to waste any more time. Please, just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarrotta, based on the examination, I can conditionally clear you for commercial driving. However, due to the slightly elevated blood pressure and the need for corrective lenses, I require a few additional steps to ensure your safety and compliance with regulations. First, I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician, Dr. Yamamoto, to discuss your blood pressure and potentially optimize your medication. I will send a report of my findings to him for review. Second, I require documentation from an ophthalmologist verifying your corrected visual acuity meets the minimum standards for commercial driving. Once I receive these documents, I can complete the Medical Examination Report form and certify you for commercial driving. In the meantime, I do not recommend operating a commercial vehicle until these requirements are met. It's essential that your vision and blood pressure are adequately controlled to ensure the safety of yourself and others. I understand you have people relying on you, but safety must be our priority. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Well, that’s not what I wanted to hear. But… I suppose it’s better than nothing. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Yamamoto right away. And I’ll get something from the eye doctor too. I don’t like waiting, but I understand what you’re saying about safety. So, what do I need to do now? Give me a list, please. And can you help me with the paperwork? I’m not very good with all this medical stuff, you see. Just tell me what forms I need and where to get them. And how long will this take? I really need to get back on the road as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Let me provide you with a clear list of the steps you need to take. 1. Schedule an appointment with Dr. Yamamoto: Discuss your blood pressure reading of 138/82 and request any necessary medication adjustments. 2. Schedule an appointment with an Ophthalmologist: Request a complete eye exam specifically for commercial driver’s license certification. You’ll need documentation verifying your corrected visual acuity meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. I have a form here, the DOT Physical Form MCSA-5876, which you can take with you to both appointments. I will print a copy for you now. 3. Return the completed DOT Physical Form MCSA-5876: Once both doctors have completed their portions of the form, please bring it back to me. 4. Medical Examination Report Completion: I will then review the forms, complete my portion of the Medical Examination Report, and certify you for commercial driving if all requirements are met. Regarding the timeline, it depends on the availability of your doctors. I recommend scheduling the appointments as soon as possible. Once I receive the completed forms, I can usually complete my portion within a few business days. I understand this is frustrating, but it's essential to ensure your health and safety. Do you have any questions about these steps, or would you like me to assist you with scheduling the appointments?
PATIENT: Okay, DOT Physical Form… right. I think I can manage that. I'll call Dr. Yamamoto tomorrow. And I'll look up an eye doctor online. I don't need you to schedule anything for me, thank you. I prefer to do things myself, you see. So, once I bring this back to you, and everything is okay… you’ll give me the card, right? The official one I need to drive? And how long is this certification valid for? Is it something I need to renew? I don't want any surprises down the road. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate you being straightforward with me, even if it’s not what I wanted to hear. Now, can I get a copy of this form for my records? And is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Sciarrotta, once I receive the completed DOT Physical Form MCSA-5876 with satisfactory documentation from both Dr. Yamamoto and the ophthalmologist, I will complete my portion and provide you with the official Medical Examination Certificate, which is the card you need to drive. The certification is valid for a maximum of 24 months if you operate a commercial vehicle intrastate, or 12 months if you operate interstate. You will need to repeat the medical examination process before the certificate expires to renew your certification. Here is a copy of the DOT Physical Form MCSA-5876 for your records. I have also included a brochure with information about the FMCSA medical requirements. It covers the specific standards for vision, hearing, and other health conditions. Finally, I recommend visiting the FMCSA website at [https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/] for more detailed information. Do you have any other questions at this time, or is there anything else I can assist you with?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me, even though I was a bit impatient myself. I’ll get the appointments scheduled right away and bring the forms back to you as soon as possible. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. Thank you again for everything. And have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I understand your eagerness to get back on the road. I wish you the best of luck with your appointments, and please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, and drive safely.
