DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I keep… burping. A lot. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lot of burping. I understand that can be really bothersome – and embarrassing, like you said. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it just… happens. After I eat, mostly. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Sometimes even when I’m not eating! It’s not… painful, just… loud. And a lot. I didn’t think it was a big deal, but it’s getting… worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happens after eating, regardless of what you eat, and sometimes even when you’re not eating. And it seems to be increasing. Do you notice anything that makes it better or worse besides eating?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, I don’t think. Sometimes… if I drink something really cold, it feels a little better for a minute? But not much. And… being nervous maybe makes it worse? But I’m always a little nervous at the doctor! It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold drinks provide temporary relief, and nervousness might exacerbate it. Do you have any other symptoms along with the burping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what do you mean? Do you mean like… feeling sick? No, I don’t feel sick. No stomach pain, or… anything like that. Just the burping. Sometimes I feel… full, even if I haven’t eaten much, but I thought that was just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, no stomach pain. Just the burping and sometimes feeling full quickly. And that feeling of fullness – how often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Um… maybe… two or three times a week? It's not every time I eat, but enough to notice. It's weird. I can eat just a little bit and feel like I ate a big meal. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lucia. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I don't think so. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to push through things. No big illnesses, or… anything like that. Just the usual little colds sometimes. I don't take any medicine regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic medical conditions, haven't been to the doctor recently, no regular medications. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. I’m… pretty lucky, I guess. I haven’t needed anything like that. Just… this burping problem now. It's just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… family history? My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think? And my grandma… she had… something with her stomach? But I don’t remember exactly what. We didn't talk about it much. It was a long time ago. Nobody really talked about health things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, and a vague history of a stomach issue in your grandmother. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? Like… do you want to know if I have friends? I work a lot, I don't go out much. I live alone. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, you work a lot, live alone. I just need to know a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. It smells bad. And… my mom didn’t like it. I’ve never even tried it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Um… I drink sometimes. Not a lot. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on the weekend? Sometimes. But it’s not every weekend. And not a lot, really. Just… to relax. It doesn't bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, usually. No food allergies. No medicine allergies. Nothing I can think of. I guess I'm pretty lucky!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Lucia, thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your stomach, and maybe press around a bit to see if we can figure out what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to stop burping! It’s very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start by listening to your stomach. Please lie down on the exam table. Okay, everything feels relatively normal, no pain when I press here. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, maybe a little more active than usual. I’m not feeling anything concerning, but there is some mild bloating. It doesn’t seem to be causing you pain, correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… full. Like I said, sometimes I feel full really easily. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… uncomfortable. It feels like there’s too much air in there, maybe? That’s the best way to describe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness and excess air. Alright, Lucia. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found on the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some degree of functional dyspepsia, possibly with some trapped gas. This is fairly common, and often related to diet, stress, or how quickly you eat. It's not usually anything serious. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a simple blood test to check your iron levels and rule out any underlying anemia. And perhaps a stool test to check for any bacterial imbalances. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay… blood test and stool test. That sounds… a little scary. But if it will help, then yes, that’s okay. I just don’t like needles… Is it a lot of blood? And what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s a very small amount of blood, Lucia - just a few vials. And the stool test is very straightforward, you just collect a small sample at home. As for finding something bad, it’s unlikely. We’re just being thorough to rule things out. It’s much more probable that it’s something minor. In the meantime, I recommend trying a few things. First, try to eat more slowly, and chew your food thoroughly. Avoid carbonated drinks, and see if cutting back on dairy products helps. Also, managing stress can sometimes make a big difference. I'm going to give you a prescription for some over-the-counter simethicone - that can help reduce gas. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… eat slower, no soda, less dairy, stress… and the medicine. That’s a lot to remember! But… I guess I can try. So, if it doesn’t get better, then I need to come back? And they will do the tests then? And… how long should I try these things before I come back?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Try these changes for about two weeks. If your symptoms haven’t improved significantly after two weeks, or if they get worse, then please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll proceed with the blood test and stool test. We'll also discuss the results then and see if further investigation is needed. Do you have any other questions for me, Lucia?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Two weeks. Eat slower, less dairy… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Get well soon.
