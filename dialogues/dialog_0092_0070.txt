DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor... Giganti, yes? It's... well, it's mostly just for the check-up, you know? New to the area. Medicare said I need to find a doctor here. Not much wrong with me, really. Just getting older, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very wise to establish care with a primary physician when you move to a new area. And a routine check-up is an excellent place to start. Let me just pull up your Medicare information here… Okay, I see your file. Just to confirm, you’re Kile Szmyd, age 58, and you've recently relocated to the area?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's right. Kile Szmyd. Fifty-eight. And… relocated. That sounds fancy. Just moved, you know? From… oh, what was it now? Somewhere with… trees. Lots of trees. I do not remember the name. Old brain, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Mr. Szmyd. It's common to have a little difficulty remembering details when there's been a big change like a move. Don’t worry about it. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical... history? Oh, boy. That's a long time ago. I… I work with makeup, you know? Theatrical. Lots of actors. Very demanding work. I haven’t been sick sick. Maybe a cold here or there. Nothing serious. My ex-wife, she always took care of the doctor things. I just… made them look pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you haven't had a primary care physician for quite some time, and your ex-wife typically handled your medical appointments. That’s alright. We'll take things slowly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Let me think. There was… a broken arm, maybe? When I was a young man. Fell from a… a bicycle, I think. Very silly thing. And… maybe a bad stomach once? But it was a long time ago. Really, I mostly just worry about the actors looking good under the lights. Not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a young man and a stomach issue at some point. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, no surgeries. Definitely no surgeries. I’m a makeup artist, Doctor, not a… a building. I create things, I don’t have things taken off. Never needed any cutting. I tell you what, the actors, they need surgeries sometimes. To look better, you know? But me? No. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me see. Sometimes, for my… the arthritis, in my hands. From all the makeup work. But it's just… a cream, you know? The kind you rub on. And… sometimes, a little something for my stomach. When it bothers me. But not every day. Just when it's… upset. I don’t remember the names. Old brain, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a topical cream for arthritis in your hands, and something occasionally for stomach upset. Do you know the names of either of those, even approximately?
PATIENT: No, no I do not. I buy them at the… the drugstore. The one near the… oh, what was it? The big… building. With the… everything. My ex-wife, she always knew the names. I just said, “Get me something for my hands” and “Something for my stomach.” I’m a visual man, Doctor. I work with color, with faces. Not with… words and names for pills.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Szmyd. No worries at all. We can work around that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I eat everything. I like good food. My ex-wife, she was always very careful about… things. I don’t remember her saying anything about allergies. Maybe I’m allergic to bad actors, but that's not a medical thing, you see?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid point, Mr. Szmyd! I’ll make a note of that. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, boy. That’s a long time ago too. My mother… she was always tired. Very tired. She… she liked to sit. And my father, he… smoked. A lot of cigarettes. But what he had, I don’t know. They didn't talk about those things. Old country, you see? You don’t ask questions. You just… live.
DOCTOR: I see. So your mother was often tired and your father was a smoker. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoked. Bad for the complexion, you see? Actors, they don't smoke. Drink? Sometimes, a little wine with dinner. Very little. For relaxation. And… recreational drugs? What are those? I work with makeup, Doctor. I create illusions. I don’t need illusions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. I just need to ask. So, no smoking, very occasional wine, and no recreational drug use. Now, finally, before we proceed with a physical exam, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Weight… maybe a little more? It's getting harder to bend over to tie my shoes. Appetite… normal, I think. I like to eat. Sleep… not so good sometimes. I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about… faces. And energy… well, I'm getting older, you see? Not like I used to be, running around with the actors. But I manage. I always manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, some weight gain, occasional difficulty sleeping, and generally feeling the effects of aging. That's all very helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my face, alright? I have actors to make beautiful. And… try not to take too long. I have a… a meeting later. About a new play.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I will be very careful. And I’ll work as efficiently as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, this arm. It's a little stiff today. Arthritis, you know? Be careful, Doctor. And… is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't hurt, Mr. Szmyd. Just a brief pressure. Okay… 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, this old chest. Lots of… theater dust. I work in very old buildings, you see? Lots of coughing. And… is that number bad, Doctor? 145? Is that a very high number? My ex-wife, she always knew the numbers.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Mr. Szmyd, and your lungs are clear, although there is some mild wheezing, which is consistent with some irritation, likely from the theater dust as you mentioned. The 145 over 88 is a bit on the higher side, but it's not a cause for immediate alarm. It's something we'll monitor, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications to help bring it down, like diet and exercise. Now, let’s check your ears and throat. Could you please open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Aaaaah… It's a little dry in here, Doctor. All the old buildings, you see? And… are you going to find anything bad in there? I have a very important play coming up. I need to be able to talk.
DOCTOR: Your throat is slightly red, but there's no evidence of any infection. Your ears look clear as well. Okay, everything looks relatively normal so far, Mr. Szmyd. Now, I’d like to quickly check your reflexes and range of motion. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, these old arms. They don't move like they used to. Arthritis, you see? And… be gentle, Doctor. I have to hold makeup brushes. Very delicate work.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is normal for someone your age. And your range of motion is slightly limited, also likely due to the arthritis. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears relatively normal, considering your age and history of arthritis. Based on my exam and what you've told me, it seems you're dealing with some typical effects of aging and some irritation from your work environment. We should get some bloodwork done to get a baseline and rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. But… don't take too much, Doctor. I have a play to prepare for. And… will it hurt? My ex-wife, she always said the needles hurt.
DOCTOR: It will be just a small amount of blood, Mr. Szmyd, and the discomfort is minimal - a quick pinch, that’s all. It’s a standard procedure to get a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. I’ll write you a lab order now. Here you go. You can take this to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. They are open from 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Do you have any questions about the lab order?
PATIENT: [Lab Name and Address]… yes, alright. Monday to Friday… that works. But… is it far from here? I don't drive anymore. And… will I need an appointment? My ex-wife, she always made appointments.
DOCTOR: It's about a 15-minute bus ride from here, Mr. Szmyd, on the number 22 bus. And yes, it's best to call ahead and make an appointment. The number is [Lab Phone Number]. Here you go. Making an appointment will save you some time. After the lab results come back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your arthritis and improve your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… yes, that's alright. And… an appointment… yes, good. My ex-wife would be proud. So… that's all for today, Doctor? Can I go now? I really need to get back to my play.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s all for today. Thank you for coming in. I’ve documented everything we discussed. Please call the lab to schedule your appointment, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s my card with the office number. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. And yes, you can go now. Best of luck with your play!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, yes, good luck to me too. Old brain, you see. But… I make beautiful faces. That's what matters. Goodbye!
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Szmyd. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
