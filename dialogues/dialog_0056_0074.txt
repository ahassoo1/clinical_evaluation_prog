DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My blood pressure's been actin' up, that's why I'm here. The numbers just ain't been right, and I figured I better get it checked out before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re getting it checked out. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on. Can you tell me a little more about when you noticed it starting to be a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm...when did it start...let me think. It's been a few months now, maybe since springtime? I don't rightly remember the exact date. My daughter, bless her heart, she bought me one of them machines to check it myself. She was worried, you see. That's when I started noticing it was higher than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, springtime…that gives us a timeframe. And it’s good your daughter is looking out for you. Do you happen to know what the numbers have been running, roughly?
PATIENT: Numbers...Oh dear. I'm not real good with rememberin' numbers, Doctor. I mostly just see if it's in the red zone, and that's when I worry. Usually around...well, higher than 140 over somethin', I think. My daughter writes it down, but I don't bother myself with it too much. It just makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently above 140/90, generally. That is something we want to address. Have you been feeling any symptoms along with the higher blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms... Now that you mention it, sometimes I get a bit of a headache, mostly in the back of my neck. And I've been feelin' more tired than usual, even after a good night's sleep. But I figured that was just from gettin' older, you know? It ain't like I'm runnin' marathons anymore.
DOCTOR: That's good information. Headaches and fatigue can definitely be related. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your eyes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just try not to poke too much, these old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, I promise. Okay, let’s start with your pulse. Pulse is 78 and a little irregular. Heart sounds… a bit muffled, but no murmurs that I can detect right now. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. I see a little bit of arteriolar narrowing, which can be associated with high blood pressure, but it’s not severe. Blood pressure reading is 152/88 today.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound too good, does it? 152... My daughter's gonna be worried. What does all that mean, exactly? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're taking this seriously, and yes, it does warrant attention. 152/88 is considered Stage 2 hypertension. That means your blood pressure is higher than we'd like it to be, and it does increase your risk for things like heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. However, we can definitely manage it with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. First, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think... I had a bit of arthritis in my knees for years, but it's mostly manageable with some cream and movin' slow. I also had the flu pretty bad a few years back, but I recovered from that. Oh, and my cholesterol's been a little high sometimes, but the doctor never said I needed to do anything drastic about it. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for an old woman, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, past flu, and occasional high cholesterol. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always been too scared of 'em, to be honest. My mama always said it was best to let your body heal itself if it could. I had a bad scare when I was younger with a friend who had a bad reaction to somethin', and I just never got over it.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. No surgeries, that’s good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family...My mama lived to be 95, and she had high blood pressure towards the end, too. My daddy passed away young from a heart attack, so there's heart trouble on that side of the family. My brother, he's still livin', and he's got diabetes, so there's that as well. It seems like there's always somethin' with this family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. That’s helpful information. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my knees when they're achin', a cream mostly. And sometimes I take a little over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches. That's about it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. They never really sit right with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just topical cream and occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. My daughter always worries about me eatin' too much salt, though. She says it's bad for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Your daughter is right to be concerned about salt intake, as it can raise blood pressure. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink of alcohol since...well, since before I got married. My husband wasn't much for drinkin' either. So, no, I don't smoke or drink.
DOCTOR: Good. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, “regularly” is a strong word, Doctor. I mostly just potter around the house, do a little gardening when the weather's nice. I walk to the store sometimes, but not every day. I try to stay movin', but I ain't climbin' mountains or nothin'. My knees wouldn't let me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so light activity, gardening, and walking. Now, what about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I like to cook. I make a lot of traditional Cherokee dishes, things my mama taught me. Lots of beans, corn, squash… and frybread, I gotta admit. It ain't the healthiest, I know. My daughter's always tellin' me I need to cut back on the salt and fat, but it just tastes better with it! I try to eat my vegetables, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a traditional diet with some fried foods and salt. That gives me a good picture. Alright, Venna, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam today, we’re dealing with Stage 2 hypertension, likely influenced by genetics, diet, and a relatively inactive lifestyle. We need to get this under control to prevent future health problems. My recommendation is to start with lifestyle changes first. I'd like you to reduce your salt intake, try to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Walking is a great start. We can also talk about some stress-reduction techniques, as stress can raise blood pressure. I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home twice a day for the next two weeks, and bring those readings back with you. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel to get a baseline of your kidney function and cholesterol levels. We'll review those results in two weeks and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle changes. If your blood pressure isn’t coming down, we may need to consider medication. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… like a lot, Doctor. I'm an old woman, you know? Changin' my whole way of eatin' and gettin' myself to exercise... it's gonna be hard. But I reckon I can try. I don't want to end up like my daddy. You said twice a day, you mean mornin' and evenin'? And what about the stress... I just try to take things easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, morning and evening is best for monitoring, that will give us a good idea of how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day. And as for stress, even simple things like deep breathing exercises or spending time in nature can help. We can discuss some resources for stress management if you're interested. Here's a log to record your blood pressure readings and some information on reducing sodium in your diet. I want you to focus on making small, gradual changes. Don't try to overhaul your entire lifestyle overnight. We’ll work together on this. I’ll see you in two weeks to review the results and how you’re doing. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
