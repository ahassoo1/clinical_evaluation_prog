DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels…difficult. I don’t like it one bit. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. “Difficult” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about that difficulty?
PATIENT: Well… it's like there’s a weight on my chest, almost. And I have to… really work to get enough air. It doesn't happen when I’m sitting up, only when I try to lie down. I used to enjoy reading in bed, but now… now it’s just unpleasant. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, Doctor. Same bed, same books… it just started happening a few weeks ago, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: I see. A feeling of weight on your chest and having to work to breathe, specifically when lying flat, and it’s developed over the past month or so. That’s helpful information. Does this happen immediately when you lie down, or does it take a little while to develop?
PATIENT: It…it happens pretty quickly, actually. Within a few minutes, usually. I'll lie down, thinking it’ll be nice, and then… there it is. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy. And then I have to sit up. I’ve tried propping myself up with pillows, and that helps a little, but it’s not a very good solution, is it? It’s hardly lying down.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound very comfortable at all. It's good you've identified that pillows offer some relief. And it sounds like it’s a relatively quick onset when you recline. Now, aside from the difficulty breathing when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No coughing, no wheezing. My ankles do swell up a bit in the evenings, but that’s been happening for years. I thought it was just…old age, you know? And I get tired easily, but I’m seventy-one, Doctor. I don’t have the energy I used to. Nothing new, except for this breathing. I haven't had a fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no wheezing, ankles swelling for years, fatigue consistent with age, and no fever. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, do you have any history of heart problems, lung problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. My doctor back home – Dr. Lewis – he told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a pill for it. I took it for a while, but then he retired and the new doctor said it wasn't so bad, so I stopped. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was younger, but I recovered fully. Otherwise… not much, I think. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful information, thank you. High blood pressure in the past, and a history of pneumonia. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You know, I really don't. It was a little white pill, I think. I wasn’t very good at remembering names, even when I was younger. Dr. Lewis just told me to take it every day. I don't recall him saying what it was called. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more help with that. It was a long time ago, and things just…fade, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Many people have difficulty remembering medication names. We can look it up in your records, if possible. Before we do that, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Dr. Lewis did ask me that once, a long time ago, and I told him no. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, and I handled all sorts of plants, and I never had a problem. I don’t use any special soaps or lotions, just whatever’s on sale at the store.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day. My sister told me to, for my heart. She said it helps prevent… something. I can’t quite remember. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. But that’s only when I really need it, maybe once or twice a week. That’s all, Doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. A daily baby aspirin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Have any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – had any heart problems, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: My mother…she had high blood pressure, like me. And she died of a stroke, when she was quite old. My father…he smoked his whole life, and he had emphysema. He had trouble breathing, too, towards the end. My sister is healthy as a horse, though. Never a sick day in her life. And I never had any children, so…that’s about it. I'm not sure if that’s helpful. It all feels rather gloomy, talking about all this sickness.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Vanderwiele. Knowing about your mother's high blood pressure and stroke, and your father's emphysema, gives me a better picture. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. My father smoked enough for all of us. It smelled terrible, and I always hated it. I always told him it was bad for his health, but he wouldn’t listen. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I prefer a good book, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, maybe a couple of times a week. It helps me relax. Nothing more than that, Doctor. I'm not much of a drinker, really. I prefer a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. A couple of glasses of wine a week. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It shouldn’t take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…fine. As long as it doesn't take too long, Doctor. I have an appointment later this afternoon. And please be gentle with my ankles, they're a bit sensitive. I appreciate you trying to figure this out. I just want to be able to read in bed again.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: There we go. A little stiff, but manageable. Do you need me to do anything special? Just breathe normally, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Yes, just breathe normally, Ms. Vanderwiele. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Again, deep breath in… and out… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise regular. Your lung sounds are slightly diminished at the bases, but I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 150/85. There is some mild swelling and tenderness in both ankles. Capillary refill is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad, Doctor? The swelling doesn’t bother me much, really. It’s just…always been there. The blood pressure…is that high? I really don’t understand all these numbers. Is it the same as my mother’s? I’m starting to feel a little anxious now. I just want to know what’s going on, and if it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel anxious, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll take it one step at a time. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, yes. 150/85 is higher than we'd like to see. It's not necessarily the same as your mother's was, but it does suggest we need to address it. The diminished lung sounds and the ankle swelling are also things we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms – difficulty breathing when lying flat, the elevated blood pressure, and the swelling in your ankles – I suspect this could be related to heart failure. However, we need to do some additional testing to confirm that. Would you be willing to have some blood work done and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. My father had heart problems, but… I thought I was healthy. Blood work and an X-ray… yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. But please…tell me everything. I don’t like surprises. What does it mean? Will I…will I be alright? I have a book club meeting next week! I need to know if I’ll be able to go.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Ms. Vanderwiele. Let me assure you, we’re going to figure this out together. “Heart failure” sounds scary, but it doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is stopping. It means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and ankles, which explains your symptoms. The blood work will give us information about your heart function and kidney function. The chest X-ray will help us see if there’s fluid in your lungs. It's too early to say definitively if you have heart failure, but these tests will give us a clearer picture. And regarding your book club meeting next week… let’s focus on getting these tests done first, and then we can discuss what that means for your activities. We’ll make a plan. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Schedule the tests. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I just… I want to be able to read my books. And go to book club. And maybe… maybe even take a little trip. But not if I’m… failing. Please, just get the tests done. And tell me everything afterwards, alright? No surprises. And try not to use too many big words. I don't understand half of what doctors say.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand. Okay, I’ve scheduled the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM here at the clinic. The chest X-ray is scheduled for this afternoon at 2:00 PM, also here at the clinic. Here are the orders. They're also electronically sent to the lab and radiology department. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I promise to explain everything in plain language, and we’ll make a plan together. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very…patient with me. I appreciate that. I suppose I’ll go home now and try not to worry too much. And maybe… maybe read a chapter or two.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. Please, do try to rest and take things easy. And yes, a good book is always a good idea. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll make sure you can get back to enjoying your life. Please call the office with any concerns. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
