DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter suggesting I come speak with someone about what shots I might need… it’s about a friend of mine who is hoping to become a citizen. I want to make sure everything is alright on my end, to help them out. Is that what you handle here?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Karry. That’s definitely something we can help with. It sounds like you're looking into the immunization requirements for sponsorship – that’s very thoughtful of you. We want to make sure you’re up-to-date, and understand any potential needs. Before we dive into that, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m… generally alright, I suppose. I’m 58 years old. I work at the college, teaching library science. It keeps me busy. I lost my wife about five years ago, so it's mostly just me now. I don’t really have any major problems, haven’t been to the doctor much except for yearly checkups. I have private insurance, if that’s important. I do try to stay healthy, but… things happen as you get older, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Karry. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been keeping things together. Losing your wife must have been very difficult. And it's good you have a regular check-up routine. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while I was cleaning the gutters. But nothing serious, not anything that required a long stay in the hospital or anything like that. I’ve had all the usual childhood shots, I think. My mother was very careful about that sort of thing. I’m not sure what all they were, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture… good to know. And it sounds like you had your standard childhood vaccinations. We can definitely look those up, but it’s good to have a general idea. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not that I'm aware of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine, as far as I can recall. My wife always said I had an iron stomach! I haven't taken much medicine in the last few years, thankfully. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Karry. No known allergies is excellent. And an iron stomach is a definite plus! Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, vitamins, nothing. I try to eat a balanced diet and get enough sleep, that's about it. I've always been a bit wary of taking too many medicines if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Karry. It's good to be mindful of what you're putting into your body. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother lived to be 85, and she was fairly healthy until the very end. She had some arthritis in her later years. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, heart trouble, I believe. And my sister… she’s still living, thankfully, but she’s had high blood pressure for a while now. On my wife’s side… her mother had diabetes. That’s all I can really recall off the top of my head. It wasn’t something we talked about a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, Karry. Heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your sister, and diabetes in your wife’s mother… I’m making notes of all of this. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she smoked for a while, when she was younger, but she quit years ago. I always thought it was a bad habit. And I try to stay away from secondhand smoke as much as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Karry. Avoiding smoking is a very positive step for your health. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing more than that. I don’t drink beer or hard liquor. It helps me relax, and it goes well with my food. But I’m not a heavy drinker, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a week. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't call it "regular," exactly. I do a bit of gardening in the spring and summer. And I walk around the college campus when I have a spare moment. But I don’t really have a set exercise routine. I suppose I should be doing more, but… it’s hard to find the time, and honestly, the energy. I'm mostly on my feet during the day at work, though. That counts for something, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts, Karry! Being on your feet at work is good activity. And gardening is excellent too. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I haven't had a full physical in a while, so it'll be good to get things checked out.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just hop up on the table for me, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'll listen to your lungs and take a look in your ears and throat. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 135 over 82. Not bad. Heart rate is 72, regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears look good, no signs of infection. Throat looks clear as well. Now, just a quick feel of your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness. And I’ll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far, Karry. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any current symptoms – any aches, pains, fatigue, anything at all that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not really. I get a little tired towards the end of the day, but I figured that was just from being on my feet all day. And my joints sometimes ache a little bit, especially when the weather changes, but nothing I can't manage with a little bit of stretching. Oh… and I’ve been having a little bit of trouble sleeping lately. Not enough to keep me up all night, but I toss and turn a bit more than usual. That’s about it, really. Nothing major. I’m an old man, I expect a few aches and pains!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Karry. Fatigue, some joint pain with weather changes, and a little bit of trouble sleeping – those are all things we can address. It's perfectly normal to experience those as we get older. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything seriously concerning. However, given your difficulty sleeping, and to just get a broader picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work. It’ll check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and just some basic things to make sure everything is functioning optimally. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds like a good idea. If you think it’s best, I’m happy to get the blood work done. I trust your judgment. I just want to make sure I’m in good enough health to help my friend with their citizenship, you know? It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. That's very understandable. And it sounds like you're taking all the right steps. I’ll write you a lab order now. It’ll just be a standard blood draw, and you can go to the lab here in the building. They’ll take care of everything. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, regarding your difficulty sleeping, we can try some simple things. Practicing good sleep hygiene – going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed – can often make a big difference. If those don't help, we can discuss other options once we have the blood work results. Now, going back to your original reason for coming in - the immunization requirements for sponsorship - let’s take a look at the CDC guidelines to see what vaccinations your friend might need. Do you know what country your friend is from?
PATIENT: They are from Mexico, Doctor. They've been here for several years now, working and paying taxes, but they're finally trying to become a citizen. It’s a long process, and I want to make sure we do everything right. I understand these rules can change, and I don't want any hiccups along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… For adults sponsoring a green card application, the requirements generally include proof of vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella , varicella , and influenza, tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis , and potentially Hepatitis A and B, depending on their age and risk factors. Do you have a record of your vaccinations, Karry?
PATIENT: I do, actually. My wife was very organized, and she kept track of everything. I think it’s in here somewhere… Here we go. These are from my childhood, and these ones are from when I started college. It's not perfect, but it’s something.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is excellent. Let’s see… it looks like you’ve had two doses of MMR, which is great. You also have a record of your varicella vaccine. And you’ve had several tetanus boosters, which is good. However, it doesn’t seem like you have a record of a recent Tdap booster, and there's no information about Hepatitis A or B. To be safe, and to meet the requirements for sponsorship, I recommend getting a Tdap booster and the Hepatitis A and B series. It's a standard procedure, and it will ensure everything is up-to-date. The Hepatitis B series requires three shots over six months, but we can start with the first one today. And we can give you the Tdap booster at the same time. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. If that’s what’s needed to help my friend, then I’m happy to get those shots. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to make sure we do everything right, you know? And I’m not afraid of a little needle if it means helping them become a citizen. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Karry. That’s the spirit! Alright, let’s head over to the nurse’s station, and we’ll get you vaccinated. It'll just be a quick pinch, and then you'll be one step closer to helping your friend. While we're waiting for the nurse, I'll also write up a summary of our conversation and the plan for your friend's sponsorship, so you have something to reference. It will include the vaccination schedule and any other relevant information. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds wonderful. A written summary would be very helpful, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowing we’re doing everything right. I'm very grateful. I’ve never had to deal with this sort of thing before, and you've been very patient with all my questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. That’s what I’m here for. It’s perfectly normal to have questions, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. And don't worry, we'll get everything sorted out. Nurse Ramirez, this is Karry Skarbek. We're going to get him vaccinated with Tdap and start the Hepatitis B series. Please provide him with the appropriate information sheets and schedule the follow-up appointments. Alright, Karry, the nurse will take care of you now. Just let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and we can talk about it. And remember, I'll also write up that summary for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much better now, knowing what needs to be done. Thank you again for all your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a wonderful day, and best of luck to your friend!
