DOCTOR: Right. Adyn Swaby, 19 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off, I think. Like, I stumble over my words sometimes. It’s hard to explain, really. I don’t… fully remember when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "A bit off." Right. And how long has this “bit off” been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Honestly? Not long, I don’t think. Maybe a few weeks? Or was it months? Everything feels a bit… blurry, if I’m being truthful. I really wish I could give you a straight answer, I do. It’s just… not coming to me.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… unhelpful, frankly. A few weeks, a few months… that’s a significant difference when trying to determine a cause. Has anything specific happened recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Let me think… My husband and I just moved, actually. A couple of months ago, I believe. A little outside of town, needed some space. It was a lot of lifting, boxes and such… construction work, really. I do work with my husband, managing things on site. But I don’t… recall anything happening happening, if that makes sense. No falls, no bumps to the head. Just… work. And moving. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Moving can be stressful, yes. But you're 19. Stress doesn’t typically cause speech impediments. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms? Let me see… I’ve been a little tired, I suppose. Just… normal tired, from work and everything. And sometimes my hands feel a bit… shaky. Not all the time, just… occasionally. It's probably nothing, to be honest. I'm a bit of a worrier, so I probably notice things more. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry I can’t be more… precise.
DOCTOR: "Normal" tired is… subjective. And shaky hands. Alright. Let’s take a look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don’t think so. I have Medicare, so I’ve had regular check-ups, but… nothing major ever came up. I’m married, so I'm usually pretty healthy, I think. My husband makes sure of that. I'm not sure what's on file, to be honest. I’ve never really needed to look at it. Is it something important?
DOCTOR: It's always important to know your medical history. Let me see… Hmm. No significant diagnoses listed. No allergies. Current medications: none listed. Alright. We'll do a quick neurological exam, then. Just to rule things out. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t blink.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Follow your finger… no blinking. Is this… alright? I feel a little silly, doing this. I hope I'm doing it right.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, like this? Is that too tight? I don’t want to hurt you. It’s hard to judge, isn’t it? I always have been a bit clumsy.
DOCTOR: Uneven grip strength. Hmm. Alright. Stand up and walk a few steps.
PATIENT: Like this? I do feel a bit… off balance, now that you mention it. I haven’t noticed it before, but… maybe I have been a little more clumsy lately. Is something wrong? I'm starting to worry now.
DOCTOR: "A little more clumsy." Right. I’m noting some mild instability. Look, frankly, given your age and these symptoms, it's… concerning. While it could be a number of things – and stress can exacerbate neurological symptoms, though it’s rarely the sole cause – I think we need to get a brain scan just to be safe. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a thorough evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh… a brain scan? Is it… serious? I mean, I understand you're the doctor, but… I just don’t understand. Is it something I did? All the lifting, the moving… I just want to know what's going on. It's frightening, hearing you say all this. My husband… he’ll be worried sick.
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a relative term. It’s precautionary. We need to rule out anything serious, and the best way to do that is with imaging. The lifting and moving could be a factor, but it's impossible to say without further investigation. I'm not going to speculate. Here's the referral to Dr. Anya Petrova. She’s an excellent neurologist. Get an appointment as soon as possible. And, to be clear, I am not diagnosing you with anything. This is simply a necessary step to determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… yes, I… I understand. A necessary step. But… what if it is something serious? What if… I… I don't know what to say. It's all happening so fast. Could you… maybe just explain it a little more simply? For my husband, if nothing else. He's very practical, and… well, I just want to be prepared. And… will this scan hurt?
