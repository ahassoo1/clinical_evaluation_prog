DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Oh, it’s just these hiccups. Been going on for… well, a good few days now. Really quite bothersome, they are! Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive. A few days is definitely long enough to warrant a look. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. They started on… Tuesday, I believe. I was having lunch with my daughter, Eileen, and just… hic… started. Nothing special, really. Just chatting, enjoying a sandwich. hic They come and go, not constantly, but maybe ten or fifteen times an hour? It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing, eating, sitting, even trying to sleep. hic It’s just… random.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started Tuesday while having lunch with your daughter, and they’ve been occurring randomly, about ten to fifteen times an hour. And they haven't improved at all since then. Have you tried anything to get rid of them, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes! Everything my granddaughter, Leilani, suggested! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, a spoonful of sugar… even getting someone to scare me! hic Nothing seems to work for very long, if at all. Leilani’s a lovely girl, but she gets her information from… well, the internet, you know? hic I tried a few things my mother used to do, too, but nothing’s helped. It’s really quite frustrating!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve certainly tried a lot of remedies! That's good to know. It's common for home remedies to sometimes offer temporary relief, but when they don’t work, it's best to investigate further. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: Let me think... hic Hmm. No, not really. I haven’t felt unwell, no fever or chills. No stomach pain, though sometimes I feel a little… full after eating, but I’ve always been a bit of a hearty eater. hic My appetite’s normal, and I haven’t been coughing or anything like that. Just the hiccups! hic They're just… there. A bit annoying, that’s all. I haven’t had any trouble sleeping, surprisingly, though Eileen worries about it. She’s a very caring girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, stomach pain, changes in appetite, cough, or trouble sleeping. That's helpful to know. Now, Ms. Sucich, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... I had my gallbladder out many years ago, probably thirty years now. And I used to have quite bad arthritis in my hands, but it’s mostly under control with medication now. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. hic Oh, and high blood pressure, but that’s managed as well. I see Dr. Sharma for that, regularly. I haven’t been to see him lately though, just been keeping on top of the pills. hic And… I think that’s it. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but the cardiologist said it was nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal thirty years ago, arthritis managed with medication, high blood pressure managed with pills under Dr. Sharma's care, and a past cardiac issue that was deemed non-concerning. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me think. For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And for the arthritis, I take… Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day, when it flares up, which isn’t too often these days. hic Oh, and a little Vitamin D, just because Dr. Sharma suggested it. hic And… I think that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills, you know? hic It makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, Naproxen 500mg twice daily as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D. And you prefer to take as little medication as possible, I understand. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, dear. Not that I’m aware of. I used to be a bit sensitive to penicillin when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t had it in years and I don’t think it’s a problem anymore. hic Nothing else. No food allergies, no reactions to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. hic My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a wonderful woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past sensitivity to penicillin as a child, but no current allergies. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Hmm. Well, I’m retired now, used to be a psychiatric aide, very rewarding work, you know? hic I live alone in my house, been there for fifty years! I enjoy gardening, mostly flowers, though I grow a few vegetables. hic I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month? hic I try to walk most days, but sometimes the arthritis gets the better of me. Mostly just a quiet life, really. I see my daughters and granddaughters quite a bit, which is lovely.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Ms. Sucich. A quiet life with family is a good life. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick examination to rule out any obvious causes for the hiccups. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. hic I trust your judgement. hic Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know, from all those years as an aide! hic It doesn’t bother me a bit. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me, Ms. Sucich. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your blood pressure is 138/82. Everything seems within normal limits so far. I’m not detecting anything immediately concerning.
PATIENT: That's reassuring to hear, Dr. Quicksey. hic I was beginning to worry it was something serious. hic It's just… annoying, you know? hic I’m glad everything seems alright. hic What do you think could be causing them, then? Do you have any ideas? hic Perhaps it’s just one of those things?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Ms. Sucich. Often, hiccups are idiopathic, meaning we don't know the exact cause. They can be triggered by things like eating too quickly, drinking carbonated beverages, or stress. However, given the persistence of yours, and to be thorough, we should consider a few possibilities. Sometimes hiccups can be related to minor irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. Or, less commonly, they could be a side effect of certain medications, or a sign of an underlying condition like gastroesophageal reflux. Since your examination was normal, and we’ve ruled out some of the more obvious causes, I think we can start with a conservative approach. I’d like to recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to see if reducing stomach acid helps. We’ll also want to repeat your blood work to ensure your electrolytes are balanced. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Dr. Quicksey. hic A sensible plan. hic I don’t mind trying a pill if it might help. hic And the blood work is fine, I suppose. hic If it’s something simple, like too much acid, then that sounds reasonable. hic I don’t want to bother with anything too complicated, you know? I’m just hoping to get rid of these pesky hiccups! hic What kind of side effects does this proton pump inhibitor have? I don’t want to trade one problem for another! hic
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Sucich, and a perfectly valid concern. Proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are generally very well-tolerated. The most common side effects are mild and can include headache, diarrhea, or constipation. More rarely, long-term use can be associated with a slightly increased risk of certain nutrient deficiencies, like vitamin B12, but we're only talking about a short trial here, so that's unlikely. I’m going to prescribe Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, for two weeks. If your hiccups haven’t significantly improved after that time, we’ll re-evaluate and consider other options, potentially including a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly agreeable, Dr. Quicksey. hic Two weeks of Omeprazole. hic I can certainly manage that. hic I’m glad we’re starting with something simple. hic And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. hic I always feel better when I understand what’s going on. hic Will I need to change anything about my diet while I’m taking it? hic Or avoid certain foods? hic
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It’s important to me that you feel informed and comfortable with the plan. As for your diet, there aren't any strict restrictions with Omeprazole, but avoiding highly acidic foods and beverages – things like citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, and alcohol – may help maximize its effectiveness and minimize any potential heartburn. Also, it's best to take it about 30 minutes before a meal, with a glass of water. I'll also send the blood work order to the lab, and they can schedule an appointment for you at your convenience. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Dr. Quicksey. hic You’ve been very thorough and answered all my questions. hic Just… hopefully, this will finally get rid of these hiccups! hic I’m so tired of them! hic Thank you again for seeing me, and for your patience. hic I really appreciate it. hic I’ll make an appointment for the blood work, and I’ll pick up the prescription. hic You’ve been a great help. hic
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I’m glad I could help. Hopefully, the Omeprazole will provide some relief. If your hiccups don’t improve after two weeks, or if you experience any unusual side effects, please don't hesitate to call the office. We’ll keep track of your blood work and follow up with you as needed. Have a lovely day, and please try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Quicksey. hic You have a lovely day too. hic Goodbye. hic
