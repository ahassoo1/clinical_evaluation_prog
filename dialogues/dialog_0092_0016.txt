DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… Farson, actually. Nicky Farson. Look, it’s about my bruising. It's getting ridiculous. I bump into things normally, you know, like anyone, but now I’m covered in these… welts. It’s embarrassing, frankly. And it’s new. I’m on that blood thinner, Coumadin, I think it’s called, and I’m worried something’s wrong with it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying your name, Mr. Farson. And I understand your concern about the bruising, especially given you’re on Coumadin. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, what isn’t going on? It feels like everything causes one now. I haven’t changed anything, haven't fallen any harder than usual... I was shaving yesterday and nicked myself, tiny thing, and it turned into a plum-sized bruise practically overnight. And the one on my arm… I barely remember how I got that one. It’s just… appearing. It's not like I'm a delicate flower, Doctor. I used to be able to take a knock.
DOCTOR: I see. That does sound concerning, Mr. Farson, especially with the ease at which these bruises are developing. It's definitely worth investigating, given your Coumadin use. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe these bruises in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? They're bruises! Purple, mostly. Some are a bit… brownish now, the older ones. Different sizes, obviously. Some small, like a coin, some bigger, like… well, like a grapefruit. They don’t really hurt, not much. More… tender, if I press on them. I suppose that’s… helpful? Look, I'm not a doctor, I just tell you what's happening to my body. It's a mess, really. And I’m starting to feel quite foolish about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and you're not foolish at all for being concerned. It's good you’re describing everything so clearly. Now, let's go through some other things. Have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Besides the bruising, you mean? Not… particularly. My gums bleed a little when I brush, but I’ve always had that. Nothing different. No nosebleeds, no blood in my stool… nothing like that. Look, I'm a relatively healthy man, Doctor. I eat reasonably well, I get some exercise… I don't go around cutting myself deliberately, if that’s what you’re thinking! This has just… started. And frankly, it's unsettling. I'm 58 years old, not some fragile old man.
DOCTOR: You're right to clarify that, Mr. Farson, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s helpful to know about the gum bleeding, even if it's been ongoing. Now, let’s talk about medications. You mentioned Coumadin, is that the only medication you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the Coumadin. And a multivitamin, every morning. That’s it. I don’t go in for all these… pills and potions. My late wife, bless her soul, she was always trying to get me to take something for this and that, but I always refused. Coumadin was the doctor’s orders, after the… incident. And I’ve been taking it regularly, I assure you. I’m not careless with my health. I may complain, but I do what I’m told.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. Knowing you've been consistent with your Coumadin is important. Now, regarding your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, if that counts. And… I had a bit of a scare a few years back. That’s why I’m on the Coumadin, actually. A blood clot in my leg. Deep vein thrombosis, they called it. Spent a week in the hospital. They said I was lucky it hadn’t gone to my lungs. That's about it. Nothing else major. I haven’t got a list of ailments, Doctor. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Farson. Knowing about the deep vein thrombosis and the subsequent Coumadin therapy is very important information. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always teased me about it, said I could eat anything without getting sick. I’ve eaten things most people wouldn’t touch. No, no allergies. I wish I had an allergy, something simple to explain this mess, but no. Just… bruising. Unexplained bruising. It's very frustrating, Doctor. Frankly, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You are not wasting my time at all, Mr. Farson. It’s my job to investigate these things, and your detailed description is helping me build a clearer picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess the bruising and look for any other clues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be, despite my best efforts. And try not to poke around too much. I’m not looking for more bruises, Doctor. Just… get on with it. I have things to do, you know. This whole thing is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll just take a look at the areas of bruising, and I'll do a brief examination to rule out any other concerns. Alright, Mr. Farson. I’m observing multiple ecchymoses – that's the medical term for bruises – on your arms and legs, varying in size and coloration. There's tenderness to palpation, as you mentioned, but no significant swelling or warmth. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. I don't detect any lymphadenopathy - that is, swollen lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Lymph… what now? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, but are you telling me anything is wrong? Is the Coumadin the problem? Are you going to have to… drain me or something? I’ve seen those medical dramas on television, you know. I just want a simple answer, if there is one. And please, try to avoid using all those… big words. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson, and I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. Let me explain in simpler terms. The lymph nodes are part of your immune system, and thankfully, they don't feel enlarged, which is a good sign. As for the Coumadin, it's possible it's contributing to the increased bruising, as it's a blood thinner. However, it's not necessarily the only cause. To determine the exact cause and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check your platelet levels and other blood components. It’s a standard test, and it will give us more information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Platelets? Now you're just making things worse, Doctor. Look, I don't want a bunch of tests. I've had enough poking and prodding for one day. Is this going to cost me a fortune? My late wife always said doctors just wanted to run tests to line their pockets. I’m on Medicare, you know. I can’t afford a whole battery of… things. Can’t you just… give me something for the bruising? Some cream or something? I just want it to stop, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? I really don't want to spend the next month going back and forth to a lab.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson, and I want to assure you that my priority is your well-being, not running unnecessary tests. I appreciate your apprehension about costs, and I can certainly work within your Medicare coverage. A CBC is a relatively simple blood test that can help us determine if your platelet count is normal. Platelets are essential for blood clotting, and a low platelet count can cause increased bruising. It's a vital piece of information that will help me understand what's happening and determine the best course of action. We can discuss the cost before proceeding, and I can also explore alternative options if you're hesitant. As for a cream, topical creams can help with the appearance of bruising, but they won't address the underlying cause. It's important to identify why you're bruising so easily. Would you be open to considering the blood test, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. But promise me, Doctor, this is the only test. No surprises. And you have to explain the results to me, in plain English. None of that… medical mumbo jumbo. And if it turns out to be nothing, I don’t want to come back. I’ve wasted enough time already. Just do the test, get me the results, and let me get on with my life. Can you promise me that? A simple test, a simple explanation, and no further appointments unless it's absolutely necessary. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Mr. Farson. A single CBC test, a clear explanation of the results in plain English, and no further appointments unless absolutely necessary. I understand your frustration, and I will respect your wishes. I'll write the order for the blood test now, and the lab will schedule an appointment for you. Once the results are back, we'll review them together, and I'll explain everything in detail. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: No. That's all. Just get the test done, and let me know what it says. And please, try not to frighten me. My late wife always worried about everything, and I don't need any more anxiety in my life. Just… the test. And a simple explanation. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. We’ll get this done, and I’ll be sure to explain everything clearly and without causing unnecessary worry. My staff will contact you to schedule the appointment. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Farson.
