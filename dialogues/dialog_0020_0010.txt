DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve noticed some swelling… I’m not entirely sure where it started, or when, exactly. It feels… recent, but my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s mostly in my… face, I think? And maybe my neck? It’s a bit difficult to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common for things to feel a little fuzzy. We’ll figure it out. So, swelling in your face and neck… and you said it feels recent?
PATIENT: Yes, recent. Perhaps within the last week or so? It’s hard to say precisely. It doesn’t… hurt, exactly. More like… uncomfortable? And it feels… puffy, if that makes sense. I haven’t done anything differently, as far as I know. I apologize for being so vague; it’s frustrating for me too.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. “Uncomfortable and puffy” gives me a good starting point. Has the swelling been getting worse, staying the same, or fluctuating at all over the last week?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it’s been… fluctuating? Some days it seems a little less noticeable, and others… well, others it’s more prominent. I think it was worse yesterday, if I had to guess. But honestly, it’s difficult to be certain. I didn’t notice anything specific that made it worse or better, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating swelling, worse yesterday… that’s helpful. And you haven’t had any injuries to your face or neck recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I haven’t been involved in any accidents, and I’m usually quite careful. I work indoors, mostly, so there isn’t much risk of that. I did… have a bit of a cold last month, but that’s long gone now. Could that possibly be related? I’m really just trying to recall anything that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: A cold last month… that could be related, yes. Sometimes lingering inflammation can cause swelling. Let's explore that a little. Besides the swelling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I’ve been feeling a little… tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I suppose I’ve also had a slight… difficulty swallowing sometimes, but it’s very mild. It doesn't happen often, and it's not painful. Perhaps it’s just my imagination. I really don’t want to bother you with insignificant details.
DOCTOR: No, these aren’t insignificant at all, Jahaad. Fatigue and mild difficulty swallowing are good things to mention. Has the difficulty swallowing been getting worse, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty consistent, I think. Not worsening. It's just that sometimes food feels like it’s taking a little longer to go down. It's not alarming, just… noticeable. And it doesn’t happen with every meal, only occasionally. Perhaps with thicker foods? I’m trying to recall specific instances, but it’s proving difficult. I apologize again for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We'll get there. So, occasional difficulty swallowing, more with thicker foods, and fatigue alongside the fluctuating swelling... Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to take a look at your neck and face, and listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up straight for me, that would be wonderful. I’m going to start by palpating your neck, feeling for any enlarged lymph nodes or tenderness. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, I'm feeling some mild tenderness in your submandibular lymph nodes on both sides. They're slightly enlarged, maybe about 1 centimeter in diameter. No significant masses detected. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I apologize if I’m asking too many questions; I just want to be helpful. The tenderness doesn’t bother me much, it’s more of a… dull ache.
DOCTOR: No, you're not asking too many questions at all. It's good to be informed. Okay, your oral mucosa appears normal, no significant inflammation or lesions noted. Your tonsils are not enlarged, and there's no visible exudate. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, the swelling, tenderness in your lymph nodes, and fatigue could be a sign of a mild viral infection, or possibly some post-viral inflammation. However, to be on the safe side, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out other potential causes, like thyroid issues or mononucleosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems prudent. I trust your judgement. Will it be a significant amount of blood? I’m not particularly fond of needles, if I’m being honest. But I understand it’s necessary to get a proper diagnosis. And, if you don’t mind me asking, how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Jahaad, nothing excessive. Just a couple of vials. And yes, I understand your apprehension about needles. We'll get it done as quickly and gently as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for them to come back from the lab. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. If the swelling worsens significantly, you develop a fever, or you have difficulty breathing, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any known allergies to medications. I haven’t taken anything regularly for quite some time, actually. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for headaches, but nothing significant. Okay, rest, hydration, and avoiding strenuous activity… I can certainly manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And I appreciate your reassurance. It’s… comforting.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. Let's get that lab order in, and then we'll schedule your follow-up appointment. Just a few more questions for the record… What’s your current occupation?
PATIENT: I am a Speech-Language Pathologist, Doctor. I work primarily with adults in a clinical setting. It’s quite rewarding, though sometimes… demanding. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good work. And do you have any significant medical history, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any significant medical history. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I do occasionally get migraines, but they’re manageable with over-the-counter medication. Other than that… nothing of note. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I apologize if I’m rambling; I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Jahaad. Thoroughness is good. Okay, here’s your lab requisition. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. They’re open until 5 pm today. And here’s a card with the number to schedule your follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results then. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Hmm… actually, yes, one question, if you don’t mind. Given my… tendency to forget things, should I be concerned about any long-term neurological effects from a viral infection? I apologize if that sounds… alarmist. It’s just… I worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Jahaad. It's good you're thinking about that. While some viral infections can have long-term neurological effects, it's relatively uncommon, and it's usually associated with more severe infections. Given your mild symptoms and the lack of any other neurological concerns, I wouldn't be overly worried at this point. However, if you do experience any new or worsening neurological symptoms – like headaches, dizziness, weakness, or changes in your vision or memory – please don't hesitate to let me know, or seek immediate medical attention. We'll monitor your progress, and if I have any concerns, I'll recommend further testing. For now, let's focus on getting these blood work results back and seeing what they tell us. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Focus on the blood work and monitor my progress… I can do that. Thank you for addressing my concerns so patiently. You’ve been very helpful and kind. I appreciate your time. I think that’s everything. I’ll go to the lab now. Have a good day, Doctor Beinborn. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. You have a good day as well. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
