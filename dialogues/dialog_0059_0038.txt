DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I believe I was advised to inquire about… paperwork? Something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I want to be prepared. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was given a few names, but I don’t recall who by, or precisely what they do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It's very responsible of you to think about these things, and it's quite common to feel a little overwhelmed by the terminology. You are right to inquire about Advance Directives and POLST forms. Essentially, these are legal documents that allow you to outline your healthcare wishes, particularly in situations where you are unable to speak for yourself. An Advance Directive is broader, covering a range of future medical scenarios, while a POLST form— Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is more specific, often used for individuals with serious illnesses. Before we delve into the specifics, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: That does clarify things somewhat, thank you. It’s… good to know the difference. As for my health… well, I generally keep to myself. I work from home, mostly. I’m an etcher and engraver. It requires a steady hand and… concentration. I don’t have any major complaints, not as far as I recall. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… some time. Years, I suspect. I do get tired easily, sometimes, but I attribute that to the nature of my work. It’s rather solitary, and the hours can be long. Is there anything specific you’d like to know? I’m afraid my recollections are… fragmented.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Buoniconti. Working from home and having a solitary profession can certainly impact one's routine and energy levels. It's good you haven't had any major complaints, but it's also important to establish a baseline, especially as we discuss future care planning. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me if you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else that a doctor has previously diagnosed?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions. Let me see. I… believe I was told, once, that my blood pressure was a little elevated. It was quite a long time ago, though. And I had… something with my gallbladder, years ago. It didn’t require surgery, just… dietary changes. I’m afraid I don’t recall the specifics. Honestly, doctor, I’ve always been rather… healthy. It’s why I haven’t made a habit of visiting doctors. I tend to… self-manage, if that makes sense. Is it important that I recall the exact details? It’s truly been a long time.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have as much information as possible, but it’s understandable that details can become hazy over time, Ms. Buoniconti. Elevated blood pressure and a history of gallbladder issues are good to know. We can certainly review those further. To continue building a comprehensive picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall, at least. I had a rather difficult birth with my son, many years ago, but I don’t believe it required a surgical procedure. It was… lengthy, and exhausting. And I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course. But beyond that… no. No surgeries. As for hospitalizations… I may have spent a night once, with a rather bad flu, but it was decades ago. I mostly try to avoid doctors and hospitals whenever possible. It’s… not a pleasant experience, as a rule. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. No surgeries beyond tonsil removal and a difficult birth, and a brief hospitalization for the flu decades ago. Thank you for sharing that. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… a difficult question. My family is… scattered, and I haven't been in close contact with many of them for years. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young. I believe she had some sort of heart condition, but I wasn’t very old at the time, and the details were never discussed openly. My father… he was a nomadic herdsman. A very strong man, as far as I recall. He lived a long life, but I don't know if he suffered from any particular ailments. I had a brother, but we lost contact many years ago. I truly don't have much information, doctor. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. It's… not something I’ve ever considered before.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It's not uncommon to have limited information about family medical history, especially if you haven’t been in close contact with relatives. We can proceed without it, though it's always helpful when available. Let's move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Absolutely not. I have never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I… lead a rather quiet and solitary life, as I mentioned before. I find my satisfaction in my work. It requires a clear head and steady hands, and those things are not conducive to… such habits. I apologize if that sounds… judgmental. It’s simply the truth. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly sufficient, Ms. Buoniconti. Thank you for being open with me. It's good to know you don’t smoke, drink excessively, or use recreational drugs. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I can eat most foods, and I’ve never had an issue with medications. Though, I rarely take anything, as a rule. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about? It’s… difficult to recall every little detail. My memory isn’t what it once was, as you know.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's helpful to know you haven't experienced any known allergies. Okay, so to summarize, you’re a 35-year-old female, generally healthy, work from home as an etcher and engraver, with a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and a past gallbladder issue, no known surgeries or hospitalizations beyond a childhood tonsillectomy and a brief flu hospitalization decades ago, limited family medical history, and no known allergies. You don’t smoke, drink excessively, or use recreational drugs. Now, before we discuss the Advance Directive and POLST forms in more detail, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better baseline understanding of your current health status. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That sounds… reasonable. A physical exam would be… sensible, I suppose. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of doctors’ offices. But if it’s necessary, then I’m willing. Please, proceed at your own pace. And if I feel… unwell at any point, please let me know. I’m not accustomed to such procedures.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. I will proceed at your pace and explain everything as we go. Please, just let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point, and we can stop or adjust as needed. First, I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we’ve already discussed. Your pulse and respiration rate are normal, and your temperature is also within a normal range. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Next, I'll take a look at your throat, ears, and eyes. Everything looks normal so far. Finally, I'll palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. This warrants further monitoring and discussion. Do you have any questions about anything I’ve done so far?
PATIENT: No, doctor. That… wasn’t as unpleasant as I feared. Thank you for being gentle. The elevated blood pressure… I suppose that’s not entirely surprising. I do lead a rather sedentary life, as I mentioned. And I tend to… worry. Perhaps that contributes to it. As for the rest… I’m glad to hear everything else appears normal. Now, regarding these… directives. Perhaps you could explain them to me again, in simpler terms? I confess, I’m still a little confused about the difference between them, and what precisely they entail. What would I need to do, if I were to… utilize them?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly understandable to be confused, and I’m happy to explain it again. Think of it this way: an Advance Directive is a broad plan for your future healthcare. It lets you state what kind of medical care you want—or don't want—if you become unable to speak for yourself. This could include things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, and who you want to make decisions on your behalf – a healthcare proxy. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a more specific medical order. It’s used for individuals with serious illnesses and outlines your current wishes for life-sustaining treatment. It’s a doctor’s order that healthcare professionals must follow. So, if you were to utilize an Advance Directive, you would fill out a form stating your wishes and appoint a healthcare proxy. This form would be kept with your medical records and shared with your healthcare team. If you were to utilize a POLST form, we would discuss your current medical condition and wishes, and I would write a medical order outlining your preferences. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about either of these forms?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That sounds… unsettling. I’m rather independent, doctor. The thought of someone else making decisions for me… it’s difficult. I suppose if I were to become incapacitated, it would be necessary. But who would I even choose? All my acquaintances are… fleeting. As for the POLST form… I don’t have a serious illness, do I? I understand it’s for… more dire circumstances. I’m simply trying to be prepared, as one does. Perhaps the Advance Directive is the more suitable option for me, then? If it doesn’t involve… relinquishing control entirely. What sort of… decisions would I be outlining, precisely? And what if my wishes were to change in the future?
DOCTOR: You raise very valid points, Ms. Buoniconti. It is unsettling to think about someone else making decisions for you, and you're right to be cautious. You are not required to name a healthcare proxy if you don't feel comfortable doing so. The Advance Directive allows you to outline your wishes even without appointing someone. And you are correct, the POLST form is typically for individuals with serious illnesses. Since you don’t have a serious illness, the Advance Directive is definitely the more suitable option for you at this time. With an Advance Directive, you can outline a range of decisions, such as: Life-sustaining treatment: Whether you want to receive CPR, mechanical ventilation, or artificial nutrition and hydration. Pain management: Your preferences for pain relief. End-of-life care: Whether you want to receive hospice care or other comfort measures. Organ donation: Your wishes regarding organ donation. And to answer your question, your wishes can absolutely change in the future. You can modify or revoke your Advance Directive at any time, as long as you are of sound mind. It’s a living document that should reflect your current values and preferences. Would you like me to provide you with a copy of the Advance Directive form?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That would be… helpful. A copy of the form, please. It would allow me to… peruse it at my leisure, and consider my options carefully. I prefer to… contemplate such matters thoroughly, before making any commitments. And perhaps… you could recommend a reputable resource, where I could learn more about these directives? I feel… somewhat overwhelmed, despite your explanations. A reliable source of information would be… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buonicotti. Here's a copy of the Advance Directive form, and this pamphlet provides a helpful overview. As for reputable resources, I highly recommend the National Healthcare Decisions Day website – – [https://www.nationalhealthcaredecisionsday.org/]. It offers comprehensive information about Advance Directives, POLST forms, and healthcare proxy appointments. The American Bar Association also has useful resources on their website. Take your time reviewing the information, and please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment if you have any questions or concerns. We can discuss it further at your convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, doctor. That will be all. Thank you for your patience and your… thorough explanations. You’ve alleviated much of my anxiety. I will… peruse the materials at my leisure, as you suggested. And thank you again for being so… gentle. It’s not often one encounters such kindness in a medical setting. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s my pleasure to assist you. Remember, taking the time to plan for your future healthcare is a sign of strength and responsibility. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and take care. .
