DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just Clide is fine. Look, I ain't got a whole lot of time, so I'll get right to it. Been runnin' a fever on and off for, oh, I dunno, maybe a week now? It goes away, comes back. It's just...annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. I appreciate you being direct. A week of intermittent fever is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the fever itself?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like I'm burnin' up, ya know? More like...warm. Gets to where I feel kinda flushed, maybe a little shaky. I usually check with a regular thermometer, and it's usually around 100, 101. Nothin' crazy. And like I said, it doesn't stay high. It comes and goes. Mostly in the evenin's, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Clide. That's helpful. And you mentioned it seems to occur more frequently in the evenings. Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I been workin’ pretty hard, seein' a lot of patients at the office. But I always work hard. Nothin’ different there. Maybe a little more stressed lately with… well, things. But stress is normal, right? I don’t know. It just…happens. I haven’t changed my diet or anything, and I'm sleepin’ okay, I guess. Regular as can be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your sleep and diet haven't changed. Stress can certainly play a role in many illnesses, so it's worth noting. To get a broader picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the fever?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. That's the weird thing. No cough, no sniffles, no aches… nothin’. Just the warm feeling and feelin' kinda tired. A little bit of a headache sometimes, but I get those anyway. Mostly just feelin'…off. Like somethin’ ain’t quite right, but I can’t put my finger on it. I keep expectin’ somethin’ else to show up, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: That’s certainly unusual, Clide, to have a fever with no other accompanying symptoms. Let's go through a bit of your medical history to see if anything might be relevant. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doc. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin’ ball. Had the usual chickenpox, measles, when I was little. Nothin' major. I see a chiropractor regularly, ya know, for my back. That's about it. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothin’ like that. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to stay active. Work keeps me movin’, at least.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Clide. And you mentioned seeing a chiropractor. Do you recall when you first started seeing them, and what condition were they treating?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, it must be… twenty years now, maybe more? Started gettin’ some lower back pain from liftin’ patients, bendin’ over a lot. Just general wear and tear, Doc. He keeps me adjusted, helps with the stiffness. I go maybe twice a week, sometimes more if I’ve been extra busy. He's a good fella. Helps a lot with the pain. But this fever ain’t got nothin’ to do with my back, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you are right to point that out, the fever is likely unrelated to your chiropractic care. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife, Doc. Avoid it if I can, ya know? I'm not a fan. Just the usual scrapes and bruises. I try to stay out of the hospital. I'm a practical man, and hospitals ain't practical. I'd rather just get on with things. This fever...I just want it to go away. That’s all. I don’t want no big procedures or nothin’.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Clide, and I understand your desire to avoid unnecessary interventions. We will certainly proceed with the most conservative approach possible. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it didn’t bother her too bad. My father had some problems with his heart, I think, but I don’t remember exactly what. He passed away when I was young. And my sister's fine as a fiddle, livin' in Florida. Nothin’ major that I know of. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about sickness, ya know? More about gettin' things done.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful information. Now, before we proceed, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, Doc. Just a multi-vitamin every day. And sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my back if it’s really botherin’ me. But I try not to take nothin’ unless I really need it. I don’t like relyin’ on pills. And that’s it. I don’t take anythin’ regularly for anythin’. Just the multi-vitamin and the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. And you mentioned taking ibuprofen occasionally. About how often would you say you take it, and what dosage do you usually take?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, not often at all, Doc. Maybe once or twice a month if I've really strained my back liftin' a patient. I take two of them, 200 milligrams, I think. Just enough to take the edge off. I don't like takin' nothin' more than that, ya know? I try to tough it out as much as I can. I'm a practical man, and I don't want to be relyin' on pills all the time. That's just...not me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That provides a good picture of your current medications. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of, Doc. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat pretty much everything. No trouble with pollen, no trouble with animals… I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. I've never had to worry about carryin' an EpiPen or nothin'. Just...no allergies. I’m a pretty simple man, ya know? I don’t need a lot. I just want this fever to go away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That is very helpful. Alright. Given your history, lack of other symptoms, and lack of allergies, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright Doc. Go ahead. Just try to be quick, if ya could. I got patients waitin’ back at the office. But I appreciate ya listenin' and not immediately jumpin’ to conclusions. I ain’t one for a lot of fuss. Just wanna figure out what's causin' this warm feelin' and get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I will be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your current temperature is 100.4 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Based on this preliminary examination, there aren't any obvious signs of infection or other acute illness. However, a temperature of 100.4 Fahrenheit, even with no other symptoms, warrants further investigation. Do you have any recent travel history?
PATIENT: No, Doc. Haven’t left Puerto Rico in years. Work keeps me pretty busy. I haven’t been on a plane since… well, since I don't remember. No trips, no nothin'. I'm a homebody, really. Just go to work, come home, spend time with my wife. That’s it. No fancy vacations or nothin’ like that. This fever just...started. Out of the blue. It’s kinda weird.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That is helpful. Given the intermittent nature of the fever, absence of other symptoms, and lack of travel history, we should consider some blood work to look for possible underlying causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to start. These tests can help rule out infection, inflammation, and other common conditions. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright Doc. Whatever ya think is best. I trust your judgment. Just get it over with as quick as possible, if ya could. I really need to get back to the office. I got patients waitin’. Blood work is fine, just...let's get it done. I ain’t afraid of a little needle, just don’t wanna be gone all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. We'll get the blood work done quickly. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. If the fever spikes above 102 Fahrenheit or you develop any new symptoms, such as a cough, sore throat, or body aches, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc. I think ya covered everything. Just… wait for the results, rest, drink water. I can do that. I appreciate ya listenin’ to me and not brushin’ me off. Some doctors just wanna give ya pills and send ya home. You actually listened. So, thanks. I guess I’ll head back to the office now. Let me know when them results are ready. Thanks again, Doc.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Clide. I’m glad I could help. I understand your concerns and want to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before the results are available. Get well soon, and thank you for choosing our practice.
PATIENT: .
