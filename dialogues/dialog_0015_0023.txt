DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts sometimes. It’s… in my breast.
DOCTOR: Your breast, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sorry… it feels… sore. Like when you bump something, but I didn’t bump anything. It’s… strange. I don’t know why it’s hurting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this soreness been going on, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Maybe… two weeks? I think so. It comes and goes. Some days I don’t feel it at all, and then other days… it’s like a dull ache, you know? It doesn't feel… hard, if that makes sense. Just… sore.
DOCTOR: And you’re certain this is breast pain, and not, say, chest wall discomfort, muscle pain, or something of that nature?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think so. It's… right here. It doesn’t hurt when I move my arms or anything. It's… in the breast. It’s hard to explain. I don’t usually get… this kind of pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to have a look. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to physically examine the area you’re describing. Please undress from the waist up, and I'll be right back. And, frankly, Mr. Bulaong, a male presenting with breast pain is unusual. We need to rule out a number of things.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… alright. Unusual? I didn’t know… I just thought it hurt. I’ll… I’ll go change now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong, if you're ready. Let's start with your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths in and out for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that good? I try to breathe deep, but sometimes it feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, although a little rapid. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate the area you described. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Is this tender?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there. Not… bad pain, but… yeah, that’s the spot. And… maybe a little here too. It feels… kind of swollen, I think. But maybe I’m just imagining that.
DOCTOR: There is some mild swelling and erythema present. The tenderness appears localized to the subareolar region. I'm also noting some slight nipple retraction. Have you noticed any discharge from the nipple?
PATIENT: Discharge? No… I haven’t checked. I don’t… I don’t usually check. Um… no, I don't think so. Should I be looking? I don't know what that even looks like.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bulaong, you should be aware of any changes to your body. While uncommon, this presentation requires further investigation. I'm going to order a mammogram and an ultrasound of the breast to rule out any serious pathology. I'll also need to order some blood work to assess your hormone levels. We need to determine if this is gynecomastia, an infection, or something more concerning.
PATIENT: Okay… a mammogram? But… I’m a man. What… what are you looking for? And… hormone levels? What does that mean? I just thought it was a little pain. It’s getting… scary now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, men can develop breast tissue, and while it’s less common, it doesn't invalidate the need for a thorough workup. Gynecomastia is the enlargement of male breast tissue, often due to hormonal imbalances. A mammogram and ultrasound will help us visualize the tissue and determine the cause. The blood work will help us identify any hormonal abnormalities. It’s better to be safe and rule out anything serious, such as infection or, in rare cases, malignancy. I understand this is concerning, but we need to gather more information. We'll start with the imaging and blood work. I'll have the staff schedule those appointments for you now. Do you have any allergies I need to be aware of before we proceed with the testing?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. Okay… imaging and blood work. Fine. Just… please tell me if it’s… bad. I don’t want any surprises. I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: The results will be reviewed by a radiologist, and I will contact you with the findings as soon as they are available, Mr. Bulaong. I've also provided a referral to a general surgeon in case further intervention is necessary. Given your uninsured status, I've noted this on the referral to facilitate options for reduced-cost care. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Uninsured… you remembered that? No… I think that’s it. Just… thank you. I guess. I’m… I’m a little scared, but I appreciate you doing all this. I’ll… I’ll wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: Very well. The staff will provide you with instructions for the imaging and blood work. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. And Mr. Bulaong, while I understand your concerns, it is important to remember that we are taking proactive steps to determine the cause of your discomfort. You're dismissed. .
