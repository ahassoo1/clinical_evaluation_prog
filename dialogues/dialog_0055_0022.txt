DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s… well, my tummy feels a bit big, you see? And I don’t feel like eating much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little while ago, I think. Maybe a few weeks? It’s hard to say, you know how it is when you get old.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And this… fullness, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly there all the time, I think. Not painful, exactly… just… full. Like I ate a big dinner, even when I haven’t. And sometimes… sometimes it feels a little bit hard. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Different. Yes, well, that’s… helpful. And have you noticed any other changes, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. Oh! I get tired easier, I suppose. Used to be I could walk all day, but now… not so much. And… well, I haven’t been going out much lately. Not much reason to, you know? It’s hard to explain. I feel… slow. Is that a change? I don’t know if it’s because of the tummy, or just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, and reduced activity. Alright. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’m going to need to ask you a few more detailed questions. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel habits? You mean… going to the bathroom? Well, I… it’s not as regular as it used to be, that's for sure. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. It’s all a bit mixed up. I don’t know if that’s important. It just… happens less often. And maybe… a little harder to go sometimes. Is that what you meant? I’m sorry, I don’t understand all the doctor words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is precisely what I meant. Thank you for clarifying. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my… blood? I… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, really. I try not to. That sounds… frightening. I haven’t seen anything… red, anyway. But I don’t always check. Is that bad? Oh dear, this is making me nervous. I just thought my tummy was… big.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon, try to remain calm. We're simply gathering information. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Not at all. And… not much nausea either. Sometimes I feel a little queasy, maybe, but that’s usually just in the mornings. It doesn’t last long. Oh, but I haven’t been eating much, have I? Maybe that’s why I don’t feel sick. It’s hard to say, really. Everything feels mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That's a long time ago. I used to have… something with my heart, I think. A long, long time ago. But the doctor fixed it. I don't remember what it was called. And my blood pressure… it sometimes goes up, my daughter tells me. She worries about it. But mostly… I just get old. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, years. I don’t remember any other illnesses, really. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh, yes! When I broke my arm, they had to set it. That was a long time ago, too. A very bad break. I don't think… I don't think I've had any other surgeries. Not that I remember. Everything gets so blurry when you get old, you know? It's hard to keep track. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Now, Ms. McConnon, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. My daughter brings it. She worries about me forgetting. It's a small white pill. But… I don't take it every day. Just when I remember. And sometimes… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it's really bad. But not regularly. I don't like taking pills, you know? They make me feel… strange. That's all. Mostly, I just try to rest. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, Ms. McConnon, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of a rash sometimes, if I eat too many strawberries, but that's not very serious. My daughter says I should be careful with shellfish, but I haven't eaten that in years. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, really. No, not that I know of. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. It’s just… this tummy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. McConnon, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and feel for any abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? Yes, I suppose so. But… it’s alright if you’re gentle, dear? My old bones are a bit… creaky. And… will it take long? I don’t like being on my back for too long. It makes me feel… dizzy. But yes, alright. I’ll lie down. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please lie flat, and I will begin. I'm hearing… diminished bowel sounds. Not entirely absent, but significantly reduced. And… There’s some tenderness in the lower abdomen, on the left side. Not acutely painful, but present. And I feel… a fullness. It’s difficult to assess the exact size at this point. It’s consistent with… a possible abdominal distention. I'm going to need to order some laboratory tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh dear… laboratory tests? What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I don't like needles, you know. And… what does ‘distention’ mean? Is it serious? I just want to know what’s wrong with my tummy. Is it my heart? Or something else? I’m getting scared now, dear. I just want to feel better. This is all very frightening.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. McConnon. Try to remain calm. The tests are relatively simple. We’ll need a complete blood count to check for infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool sample to rule out any gastrointestinal issues. The blood draw will involve a small prick, yes, but it's brief. “Distention” simply means your abdomen is swollen. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious, but we need to determine the cause. As for your heart, it's unlikely to be directly related at this point, but we need to rule out all possibilities. I’m going to order these tests immediately. My nurse will come in to draw your blood and provide you with a container for the stool sample. We’ll also need to obtain a urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Urine… and stool… and blood? Oh dear… it’s all so much. I just came in because my tummy feels big. I don’t understand all these tests… and I’m afraid of needles. And what if something is seriously wrong? I don’t have anyone to help me… my daughter lives far away. I feel so alone. I… I just want to go home. Is there anything… anything we can do without all these tests? Maybe it’s just something I ate? I don’t feel very well, dear. I just want to rest.
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand your anxiety, but we cannot determine the cause of your discomfort without conducting these tests. It’s irresponsible to simply dismiss your symptoms without a proper evaluation. I assure you, these tests are standard procedure. They will provide us with valuable information and allow us to rule out any serious underlying conditions. The alternative – ignoring your symptoms – could lead to a more severe outcome. My nurse will be in shortly to assist you with the sample collections. She will explain the process in detail. I strongly advise you to proceed with these tests. It’s in your best interest. If the results are concerning, we may need to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist. Is that understood?
PATIENT: A… a gastroenterologist? Oh dear… what’s a gastroenterologist? Is that… a bad doctor? And you said 'if'? Is it serious then? I just want to know what’s wrong with my tummy… I don’t want to see lots of different doctors… I just want to feel better. I… I think I need my daughter. Maybe I should just go home and wait… I don’t think I can do all these tests right now. I’m too scared, dear. Please… can’t we just try something else? A little medicine, maybe? I just feel so overwhelmed. .
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, I understand you're feeling anxious, but your emotional state is not aiding in a proper diagnosis. I have explained the necessary steps to determine the cause of your discomfort. Delaying further evaluation is not in your best interest. While I sympathize with your fears, I cannot provide a definitive answer without the results of the tests. A gastroenterologist specializes in digestive disorders and would be the appropriate specialist to consult if necessary. I will have my nurse bring you the paperwork for the laboratory tests. If you refuse to proceed, you do so at your own risk. I strongly advise you to reconsider. .
