DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. So, Ms. MacVittie, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s…rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. It’s just…frequent. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Frequent…yes. And by “frequent,” could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Quantify… That's…difficult. I suppose… normally, I’d go, you know, a normal amount throughout the day. Perhaps four or five times? But now…it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes even more often. It’s hard to keep track, truthfully. It’s not painful, just…constant. I don’t really know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Every couple of hours…and you say this is a change from your usual pattern?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely a change. It’s only been…well, I’m not entirely sure when it started. Perhaps the last few weeks? It’s a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid. I haven’t been keeping a strict log, you see. Things have been…a little chaotic lately. I just noticed it was becoming bothersome enough to…well, to come and see you. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Chaotic…yes, I understand. And is there anything with the urination itself that's different?
PATIENT: Different…? Hmm. Let me see… No, not really pain, like I said. No burning. The…stream itself feels normal, I think. Not weak or anything. Just…more of it, perhaps? And more often, of course. I sometimes feel like I haven’t fully emptied my bladder, but then I go back a little while later and…well, more comes out. It's a bit of a cycle, I suppose. I’m not sure if I'm being very clear.
DOCTOR: More often, a sensation of incomplete emptying…right. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. I haven't felt unwell, not at all. No chills, no sweating…nothing like that. Just…this constant need to go. I haven't taken my temperature, but I feel…normal, otherwise. I suppose I should have, shouldn't I? But it just feels…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient…yes. And any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really…I mean, nothing drastic. I’ve been… a little stressed, so perhaps I’ve been drinking more tea? Herbal tea, mostly. Chamomile, things like that, to try and calm down. But no, nothing else. No more caffeine, no more water than usual… I don’t think so. It’s all a bit of a blur, I must admit. I've been rather preoccupied. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Stress…tea…right. Now, let's move on. Do you have any pain in your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Lower abdomen… No, not really pain, exactly. It's more…a feeling of fullness, sometimes? Like a slight pressure, but it’s not sharp or anything. It comes and goes. It’s difficult to describe. And it's not constant, like the…the bathroom issue. It’s just…a little uncomfortable, occasionally. Does that make any sense? I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Fullness…right. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits as well?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh dear. That feels rather personal. No, not really. Everything seems…normal in that regard. No constipation, no diarrhea…nothing out of the ordinary. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just…everything feels a bit muddled at the moment. I haven’t really been paying close attention to…well, to anything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never been told I have diabetes. I've had the usual check-ups, I think, but nothing ever came up. I have…had a few minor things over the years, but nothing serious. A bad back, a touch of the flu…the usual. But certainly no diabetes, as far as I’m aware. Would it show up in a routine check-up? I’m terribly sorry, I’m rather forgetful, I’m afraid. I should probably have all my records…
DOCTOR: Never mind. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, no. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I don’t take anything regularly, so I haven't really had much opportunity to be allergic to anything! Just the occasional pain reliever for my back, and I’ve never had a problem with those. Does penicillin count? I think I had that as a child, but I don’t recall a reaction. I really wish I kept better track of these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Of course. Is there…anything I should do to prepare? Should I empty my bladder first? I suppose I probably should, shouldn't I? It's all rather…sudden.
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary for now. Just lie down, and I will listen to your abdomen. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax… Right. Trying to relax. It’s just…I'm not very comfortable with examinations, I'm afraid. But I’ll do my best. Please just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sounds…normal. No tenderness to palpation. Bladder is…palpable, but not distended. Now, stand up.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Standing. Is everything alright? Is there anything I should be feeling for? I'm afraid I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Well. It appears there’s nothing obviously wrong. Based on what you’ve told me, and my brief examination, it could be a urinary tract infection. However, without a urine sample, I can’t be certain.
PATIENT: A urinary tract infection… Oh. Is that…serious? I mean, is it something that needs antibiotics? I'm not keen on taking antibiotics, if I can avoid it. I've heard they can disrupt everything. A urine sample…right. How do I… collect that? And where do I take it?
DOCTOR: It can be serious if left untreated. And yes, usually requires antibiotics. I'll write you a requisition for a urine analysis and culture. You can take it to any lab. They’ll provide you with a sterile container and instructions. Return the results to me as soon as possible. If you develop a fever, chills, or lower back pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A fever, chills, lower back pain… Yes, I understand. Emergency room. Right. And…if it’s not an infection? What then? Is there anything else it could be? It’s just…I’m a little anxious about it, to be honest. I don’t like feeling unwell, and I don’t like the thought of taking antibiotics unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. Stress, diet, fluid intake… sometimes these things just resolve on their own. However, it’s best to rule out an infection first. Try to drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, make an appointment to see me again. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Plenty of water, avoid caffeine… and see you again if it doesn’t improve. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye. .
