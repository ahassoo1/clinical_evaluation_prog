DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Pirl! It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunization visit, like the nurse said on the phone. I figured I should probably stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A preventative check-up is always a good idea. Just to confirm, you mentioned immunizations... Are there any specific vaccines you were hoping to receive today, or were you leaving that open to my recommendations?
PATIENT: Hmm...to be honest, I hadn't really thought about specifics. I just know I'm due for something, you know? Whatever you think is best, really. I trust your judgment. I don’t keep track of all that stuff. It all just sounds like a lot of letters and numbers to me!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Fornes. Many people find it difficult to keep track. Let me access your records here… Ah, yes. It appears you are due for a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and also your annual influenza vaccine is recommended. Do you have any allergies to vaccines or any concerns about either of those?
PATIENT: Tdap and flu… okay. Nope, no allergies that I know of! Never had a bad reaction to anything before, thankfully. Flu is always a good idea, I guess, especially with all the little ones running around at the community center. As for the other one… is that the one that protects against lockjaw? I think my grandma used to talk about getting a shot for lockjaw when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Tdap does protect against tetanus, often called lockjaw. It’s a very important booster to keep your immunity up. And you’re right to be mindful of protecting yourself and others, especially with community involvement. Before we proceed, just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that – in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, nothing really. Just the usual summertime sniffles, you know? A little bit of a stuffy nose here and there, but nothing that kept me in bed. My husband, Dale, had a bit of a cough last month, but he's all better now. He said it was just allergies, too. Lots of pollen this year, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant recent illness. Now, just to get a better overall picture, may I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Medical history…well, I’ve been pretty lucky, honestly. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else, and I broke my arm once when I was younger—fell out of a tree, trying to rescue a kitten! But other than that, nothing major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’m generally a pretty healthy person, I think. I try to eat well and stay active. Dale and I go for walks down by the beach pretty often.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Fornes. An active lifestyle is very beneficial. And no significant past medical or surgical history – excellent. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… my mom had some trouble with her heart when she got older, I think. High blood pressure, something like that. And my grandpa, on my dad's side, he had diabetes. But other than that…not really. My dad was pretty healthy, and my siblings are all doing okay, too. Nothing major to worry about, I think. We weren’t really a family that talked a lot about illnesses, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Fornes. Many families are not particularly forthcoming with that information. It's still good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else environmental, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to any medications, either. And I love animals! We have a little terrier mix named Rosie. She's a sweetheart. Pollen bothers me a little in the spring, makes my eyes itchy, but nothing a little allergy medicine can't handle. Really, I'm pretty lucky when it comes to allergies. I've always been a pretty sturdy person, I guess.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. That simplifies things nicely. Now, Ms. Fornes, just a quick check – are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Oh, I take a baby aspirin every day. Doctor recommended it a few years back, just to be on the safe side, you know? And I take a multivitamin, mostly just because I feel like I should. Nothing else, though. No special supplements or anything like that. Just the aspirin and the multivitamin. Oh, and sometimes I take something for heartburn if I eat something spicy, but that’s not regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, baby aspirin daily, a multivitamin, and occasional medication for heartburn. Now, just to finish up with the history, may I ask about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, like I said, Dale and I try to stay active. We walk down by the beach almost every day. I’m retired now, used to be a construction inspector, so I’m pretty good at staying on my feet! I do a little gardening, too. Mostly vegetables. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a good piece of chocolate now and then. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much—just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. We don’t really have a lot of bad habits, I think. Pretty simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, Ms. Fornes. Alright, it appears we have a good understanding of your overall health. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, just to confirm everything we've discussed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine! Absolutely. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Pirl. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold! I always get chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fornes. I’ll make sure you’re comfortable. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No edema in the extremities. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds and looks good.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear! I always worry a little bit when I go to the doctor, but that all sounds very reassuring. So, what’s the next step? Are we going to do the shots today? I don’t mind, I just…well, I’m not a huge fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fornes, if you are comfortable, we can proceed with the Tdap and influenza vaccines today. I completely understand your apprehension regarding needles – many people share that feeling. I will do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or concerns about either of these vaccines?
PATIENT: Hmm...not really. I mean, I know the flu shot keeps you from getting really sick, and I remember something about tetanus being from dirty wounds, right? Like stepping on a nail? Is there anything I should watch out for after the shots? Like, will I feel sick? Or get a fever? Just want to be prepared, you know? Dale usually has to take care of me when I get sick. He's a good nurse, but he worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct about tetanus. It is often contracted through dirty wounds, and it’s a very serious infection. As for side effects, most people experience mild soreness at the injection site, and some may experience a low-grade fever or fatigue for a day or two. These symptoms usually resolve on their own with rest and fluids. I'll provide you with information on managing any potential side effects. It's rare to have a serious reaction. And Dale sounds like a wonderful caregiver! We can proceed now, if you'd like. I’ll start with the influenza vaccine, and then the Tdap. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that sounds good. Start with the flu shot, then the other one. I just… maybe don't tell me when you're about to poke me? I don't do well with anticipation. And maybe a band-aid afterward? I like band-aids. It makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. No announcement beforehand, and a band-aid afterward – you got it. Just a quick pinch… …and done. See?
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn’t too bad. A little pinch, you were right. So, what about the other one? Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. This one might feel slightly more noticeable, just because of the volume, but it will be quick. Now… …and all done. Here, let’s put a band-aid on each arm. There we are. All finished! How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh…okay. That one was a little more of a pinch, but you were really quick. Thanks, Dr. Pirl. You really made it as painless as possible. I think I just need to sit down for a minute. And maybe take a few deep breaths.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. Please, have a seat and take your time. I'll document the vaccinations and provide you with some information about potential side effects, and what to do if you experience any. Here you go. This outlines common side effects, such as soreness at the injection site and low-grade fever, and when you should contact me or seek medical attention. Do you have any questions about the information sheet?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Dr. Pirl. This is very helpful. Hmm… says I might feel tired? That’s good to know. Dale gets worried if I nap too much. Okay, and contact you if I have a really bad reaction… That’s good to know too. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Everything seems pretty clear. I guess…when will I be considered fully protected? Like, how long does it take for the vaccines to kick in?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Ms. Fornes. It takes about two weeks for your body to develop full immunity after receiving these vaccines. During that time, your immune system is building protection. You'll want to avoid close contact with people who are sick during those two weeks, if possible. After that, you should be fully protected against the influenza virus and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, two weeks. Got it. That's good to know. No, I think that's all my questions, Dr. Pirl. Thank you so much for your patience, and for making it as easy as possible. You were very kind. I really appreciate it. I think I’ll just head home and take a little nap. Dale will be glad to hear I’m all vaccinated.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you experience any concerning symptoms. And do enjoy your nap – you deserve it! Have a wonderful day, and stay well.
PATIENT: .
