DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but slowly. It makes things… difficult. I used to be very strong, working with the athletes, but now… not so much. It’s in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astores. A gradual onset of weakness, primarily in your legs, with some involvement in your arms as well. And you mentioned you used to be involved with athletes – that suggests a good level of physical activity in the past. Could you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I was an athletic trainer for many, many years. Football, mostly, high school and some college. Always running, helping them stretch, lifting… strong work. Now, walking… even just getting up from a chair… it takes effort. It’s… hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. More like… heavy. And tired. Like trying to move through water. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astores. “Heavy” and “tired,” like moving through water – a very helpful description. So, it’s not sharp pain, but a feeling of increased effort with movement. When did you first start noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It started… maybe a year ago? It was small then. I just thought I was getting old, you know? A little slower. But it’s been getting worse the last six months, I think. I started tripping a little more. Had to hold onto things. Then it started being harder to get up… and now… well, now I worry.
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in to get it checked out, Mr. Astores. It’s always best to address these concerns. Six months of progressive weakness, with some tripping. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms specifically affecting your ability to do things – like lifting objects, or dressing yourself?
PATIENT: Well… dressing myself is still okay. It takes a little longer sometimes to button the shirts, but I can do it. Lifting… lifting is harder. Not heavy things, but even groceries… I have to be careful. And sometimes my hands feel… clumsy. Like they don’t listen to me when I try to pick something up. It’s not all the time, just sometimes. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty with fine motor skills – like buttoning shirts – and occasional clumsiness with your hands. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the weakness, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel… blurry vision. Not all the time, and it comes and goes. And… this might sound strange… sometimes I feel… numb. Like pins and needles. Mostly in my feet. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels funny. And… I get tired very easily now. Even after a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astores. That’s very helpful. Blurry vision, intermittent numbness or tingling in your feet, and increased fatigue. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years ago I had high blood pressure, but he put me on a pill, and it's been okay. I take it every day. Other than that… I haven’t had much trouble. I had the flu a couple of times, but everyone gets the flu. Nothing serious. My wife, she keeps me healthy, you know? Always making sure I eat right.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and it's wonderful you have such a supportive wife. And you’re taking medication for your blood pressure, which is excellent. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for the pressure. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but not very often. Mostly I try to rest when I have a headache. My wife makes me chamomile tea. She says it helps.
DOCTOR: Sounds like you have a very good system in place. Now, Mr. Astores, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things. My wife makes good food, so I don’t complain!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had something wrong with her legs when she got old. She couldn't walk very well. The doctors said it was… arthritis, I think. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had a stroke, many years ago. But other than that… not that I know of. We didn’t talk much about these things when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis in your mother and a stroke in your uncle. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My father didn't smoke, and I didn’t want to either. Bad for you, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy. My wife and I enjoy it with our meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, finally, tell me a little about what you do in a typical day. Are you active?
PATIENT: Well, not as active as I used to be. I used to work in the garden a lot, but it's getting harder to bend and kneel. Now I mostly sit and read, or watch TV with my wife. I try to take a short walk every day, but it’s not very far. I like to visit my grandchildren when I can. They keep me young.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Astores. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't be overly uncomfortable. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and do a quick neurological exam. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in the upper extremities, and 1+ bilaterally in the lower extremities. Strength is 5/5 in your arms, but I'm noting some weakness in your legs, particularly in your ankles and feet… about 4/5. And I observe some mild instability with gait and a slightly shuffling stride. Now, I’d like to check your sensation… Sensation is intact to light touch in your arms and trunk, but slightly diminished in your feet. Mr. Astores, are you feeling any tingling or numbness as I do this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not pain, just… funny. Like pins and needles, like I said before. It’s worse on the outside of my feet. And… now that you’re checking… my balance feels a little off. I feel like I have to concentrate to stay standing still.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astores. That's very helpful. So, diminished sensation, particularly on the outside of your feet, accompanied by a feeling of imbalance. Based on this examination, and the information you’ve provided, several possibilities come to mind. Given your age, the gradual onset of weakness, numbness in your feet, and the findings on the neurological exam, we need to consider peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. We also need to rule out other causes of weakness, such as vitamin deficiencies or problems with your circulation. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid panel. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… what was the other thing? Sounds… complicated. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes, let’s do it. I want to know what’s going on. I just… hope it’s not something too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astores. It is a lot of information, and it can be unsettling. The EMG and nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles, which will help us determine if there is nerve damage and where it's located. It does involve small electrodes being placed on your skin, but it shouldn’t be painful, just a little uncomfortable. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and the EMG/Nerve Conduction study now. The lab is just down the hall, and you can schedule the EMG/Nerve Conduction study at the imaging center. The results should be available in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active as much as you comfortably can, and to avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. I also advise you to wear supportive shoes and to be careful when walking to prevent falls. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. I will try to stay active and be careful. A week, you say? I will wait for the results then. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. I'm glad I could help. I will also have the nurse provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the test orders. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results in detail then and develop a plan based on the findings. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe weakness, loss of bowel or bladder control, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any mobility issues getting home today that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I can get home alright. I’ll take a taxi, nice and slow. My wife usually meets me at the door with a cup of tea. I appreciate you asking, though. Very considerate.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and wonderful to have such a supportive wife! Alright, Mr. Astores, I think that concludes our consultation for today. Again, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Good day to you. .
