DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s my sight, you see. It’s…diminishing. Not suddenly, thankfully, but steadily. It’s quite inconvenient, to put it mildly. I pride myself on being a sharp man, and this…this is unsettling.
DOCTOR: "Diminishing," you say. A rather vague description, unfortunately. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Vague? I find that a bit…presumptuous, Doctor. But very well. It’s not a complete blackout, certainly. More like…looking through a dirty window. Things aren’t as crisp as they used to be. Especially at a distance. Reading fine print…that’s becoming difficult. And frankly, judging by the state of some of the paperwork I receive at the office, that’s a blessing in some cases. Though, it is my job to review it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Dirty window.” I see. And how long has this been progressing?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. It's not as if it happened overnight, you understand. Gradual. Perhaps… six months, maybe a little longer? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. I don’t typically dwell on such…subtleties. It just became noticeable enough to be…problematic recently. I suppose that's when I decided to finally address it.
DOCTOR: Six months. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Are you suggesting I’m…falling apart, Doctor? I assure you, my health is generally quite good. But, if you must know… there's been a bit of…eye strain, I suppose. After prolonged reading, naturally. And perhaps a slight…sensitivity to bright light. Though that could simply be the dreadful fluorescent lighting in that office of mine. It’s truly barbaric.
DOCTOR: Eye strain and sensitivity to light. Alright. And any floaters, flashes of light, or any loss of peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Floaters… flashes… peripheral vision… Doctor, are you attempting to intimidate me with medical jargon? I’m not a physician, you know. I deal with people, not…anatomy. I haven’t noticed anything… dramatic. Things aren’t… disappearing, if that’s what you’re asking. Perhaps a slight…dimness around the edges, but nothing I would consider alarming. Frankly, I find this line of questioning… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I maintain a…respectable lifestyle. I eat well, though admittedly I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner. And I’m quite active, despite the… sedentary nature of my profession. I walk whenever possible, and I certainly don’t spend my time indulging in… unhealthy habits. My health has always been…above average, if I may say so myself. It’s quite perplexing, this whole situation. Really, quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I believe in letting the body heal itself, Doctor. A bit of rest, a healthy diet, and a positive attitude – those are far more effective than…potions and pills. I might take an aspirin on occasion for a headache, but that’s hardly worth mentioning. I assure you, my medicine cabinet is rather…sparse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your eyes. Please, have a seat in the examination chair.
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must say, I’m rather skeptical this will yield any useful results. But proceed, Doctor. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Follow my light, please. And try to relax. Hmm. Visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. I observe some mild lens opacities, consistent with age-related changes. Retinas appear normal with no hemorrhages or exudates noted. Taps pen on chart. No obvious signs of macular degeneration or glaucoma. Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, it appears you are developing cataracts. It’s quite common at your age.
PATIENT: Cataracts? Is that all? After all this questioning, all these…intrusive examinations? Cataracts? My grandfather had cataracts. It's… pedestrian. Frankly, Doctor, I was expecting something far more…significant. Is there anything that can be done about it? I have important engagements, you see. I can't simply… squint my way through life.
DOCTOR: Yes, there are options. The standard treatment is surgical removal of the cloudy lens and replacement with an artificial intraocular lens. It’s a very common and generally safe procedure. However, given the mild nature of your cataracts at this stage, we can simply monitor them for now. If your vision continues to deteriorate, then surgery would be the next step. We could also discuss prescription glasses to help improve your current vision. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Surgery? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I have no desire to undergo a surgical procedure for something…so commonplace. Monitoring, you say? Very well. But I expect regular updates, Doctor. And I trust this won’t interfere with my schedule. Prescription glasses… perhaps. But I refuse to be dependent on corrective lenses. And… what is the prognosis, Doctor? If I do allow this… situation to progress, what am I looking at? Be precise. I dislike ambiguity.
DOCTOR: If left untreated, cataracts will continue to worsen, leading to progressive vision loss. Eventually, this could impact your ability to perform daily activities such as driving, reading, and recognizing faces. The rate of progression varies from person to person. Regular monitoring, ideally every six months, will allow us to assess the severity of your cataracts and determine when surgery becomes necessary. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Six months? Very well. I suppose that's…acceptable. But I trust your staff is efficient? I have a rather demanding schedule, you see. And I expect prompt reminders for these…appointments. And one final question, Doctor. What are your…success rates with this cataract surgery? I expect a high degree of precision and a minimal risk of complications. Don't insult my intelligence with vague assurances. I want figures. Percentages. Specifics.
DOCTOR: Our surgery success rate is approximately 95% with excellent visual outcomes. Complications are rare, but can include infection, inflammation, and retinal detachment. The risk of retinal detachment is less than 1% in most cases. However, I must reiterate that these are statistical averages, and individual outcomes can vary. I will schedule you for a follow-up appointment in six months. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Ninety-five percent… acceptable. I suppose. Very well. No, Doctor. That will be all. Ensure the appointment is scheduled for a time that does not conflict with my engagements. And please, do not waste my time with unnecessary preliminary examinations. I understand the procedure. Good day, Doctor. I trust we’ve covered everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. The staff will be in touch regarding the appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
