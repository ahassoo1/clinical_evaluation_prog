DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been my wife, mostly. She says I’ve been… not myself lately. Forgetful, she says. Though I don't see it. But she insisted. Episodes of confusion, she called them. Honestly, women. Always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's good she’s looking out for you, Mr. Lason. It's often helpful to have someone else's perspective. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t notice things yourself. It happens. These "episodes of confusion" – can you tell me a little more about what she means by that?
PATIENT: Well, she says… last week, I was trying to fix the gutter. Simple thing, really. And I just… I couldn’t remember which end was up. Sounds silly, doesn’t it? Like I was trying to put the roof on backwards. And then there was the time I went to the store for milk and came back with… garden hoses. Don’t ask me why. She says I just stared at the milk for a good five minutes like I’d never seen milk before. It’s… irritating, to be honest. Makes me feel like she thinks I’m losing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit concerning. Difficulty with familiar tasks and getting lost or confused about things like that… it's good she's paying attention. Just to get a better picture, have these episodes been happening for a long time, or are they relatively new?
PATIENT: Relatively new. I’d say… maybe the last three or four months? Before that, I was as sharp as a tack. Always knew where I left my tools, could tell you the make and model of any tile I ever laid. Now… well, now it’s like my brain’s got a little static in it. It comes and goes. Some days I’m fine, some days… not so much. It's not constant, Doctor. That's the frustrating part.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know – the fluctuating nature of it. And you said it started around three or four months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, around then. Thinking back… it started not long after we had that new neighbor move in. Old man Henderson. Very… chatty. Always stopping by to talk about his prize-winning tomatoes. It's probably nothing, but it feels like everything started getting a bit… fuzzy around the time he arrived. Honestly, the man talks too much. It probably scrambled my brain.
DOCTOR: Well, we can certainly rule out excessive tomato discussion as a cause. Let's focus on what's been happening with you. Aside from the memory issues and confusion, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… My wife also says I’ve been… quieter. Less interested in things. I used to spend hours in the garage, tinkering with my tools, building things. Now… not so much. I just… sit. And I've been a bit more… irritable, I suppose. Snap at her over nothing. It's not intentional, you understand. I just don’t have the patience for… nonsense. Like her rearranging the spice rack. Why does she do that? It was perfectly organized before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased interest in hobbies, some irritability, and a change in personality… These things are all important. Now, have you had any physical symptoms along with these changes?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? You mean like… aches and pains? No, not really. I’m an old man, Doctor. Everything aches a little. But nothing… new. No headaches, no dizziness, no trouble seeing or hearing. Just… this. This foggy feeling in my brain. And the wife complaining. Mostly the wife complaining. Though I did stumble a bit the other day, going up the porch steps. But I blamed it on the uneven flagstones. They really need to be replaced, you know. Old man Henderson said— Never mind. Just the steps. They're uneven.
DOCTOR: Alright, uneven steps aside. The stumble is good to know though. Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. Arms and legs are working just fine. I still do all my own tiling, you know. Just finished a bathroom remodel for the Johnsons down the street. They were very pleased. Solid work, if I do say so myself. Though it took me a bit longer than it used to, figuring out the pattern. That's probably just getting old, though. Not some weakness or numbness. I’m a tile man, Doctor. I need my hands. And they work. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your reflexes, balance, and a look in your ears and eyes. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’m not as spry as I used to be. And I’ll warn you, I don't like anyone touching my ears. Old man Henderson told me— Never mind. Just get it over with. As long as you don't poke around in my ears too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. If you could sit here for me. And we’ll take it slow. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, symmetric. Gait is slightly slower than expected for age, but steady. No significant balance issues observed. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam reveals mild drusen, consistent with age-related macular degeneration. No other acute findings. Ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes are intact, normal color. Alright. Everything seems physically normal, within the expected range for your age. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And some fish oil, my wife insists. Says it’s good for the brain. Though I don’t see how swallowing a capsule is going to fix anything. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. Though, I did try that herbal remedy Old man Henderson recommended… for my memory. Tasted awful. Didn’t do a thing. Stopped taking that after a week. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, fish oil, and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for okra. And my wife makes a terrible stew. But those aren’t allergies. Just… bad taste. Never been one to be picky, though. A man’s got to eat. And I’ve never had anything bother me. Never. Though, that herbal remedy Old man Henderson… Never mind. No allergies. None.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Considering everything we’ve discussed – the new onset of confusion, memory issues, personality changes, and fluctuating nature of the symptoms – I think it's important we investigate this further. There are a number of possibilities, and it's too early to say definitively what's going on. It could be something relatively benign, but it also could be something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also think a brain scan – either a CT scan or an MRI – would be helpful to get a look at what's going on inside your brain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work? A brain scan? Now hold on a minute. You’re talking about poking around inside my head? I’m not so sure about that. Seems a bit… drastic, doesn't it? I just came in because my wife worried a bit. And you want to scan my brain? What are you looking for, exactly? I’m an old man, Doctor. Things are supposed to be slowing down. That’s just… life. I don’t need poking and prodding and scans. Maybe I just need a good rest. And to get away from Old man Henderson. Honestly, I think he’s messing with my head.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Lason. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important. The symptoms you're describing – the confusion, memory issues, personality changes – could be caused by a number of things. Sometimes it is just normal aging, or stress, but sometimes it can be a sign of something more serious, like a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid problem, or even early signs of dementia. The blood work is relatively simple – just a routine test to check your levels. The brain scan is a bit more involved, but it's non-invasive – you'll just lie still in a scanner while it takes pictures. It won't hurt, and it can give us valuable information about what's going on in your brain. I want to rule out anything serious and make sure you get the best possible care. If everything comes back normal, then we can look at other options, like stress management or lifestyle changes. Would you be willing to at least consider the blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright. Fine. I suppose I can handle a little blood work. But that brain scan… I’m still not convinced. It sounds… uncomfortable. And expensive, probably. But blood work… alright. Just blood work for now. But don't expect me to lie in any fancy machines, Doctor. I’m a tile man, not a science experiment. And honestly, if I start forgetting things, I’ll just ask my wife. She remembers everything. Even things I’d rather forget. Just blood work. That’s all. And I’m blaming you if I have to sit in a waiting room all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Just the blood work for now. And I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make it as quick and convenient as possible. I'll write you a requisition form for the lab, and the nurse will explain everything to you. We’ll get the results back as soon as possible, usually within a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden changes in your symptoms, or if you become more confused or disoriented, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… don’t expect miracles from those blood tests, Doctor. It’s probably just old age, like I said. And try to keep that Old man Henderson away from my medical chart. I’m starting to think he’s influencing the results. Though, how would he do that…? Never mind. Just get the blood work done. And keep me away from the waiting room as much as possible. It’s full of germs, you know. And people talking about their aches and pains. It’s depressing. I suppose I’ll be seeing you again soon. Hopefully, it's just nothing. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’ll see you soon. And we'll do our best to get you in and out as quickly as possible. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
