DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been the best lately either. It feels… heavy sometimes. Been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A cough and some heart palpitations… alright. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe a month now? It’s hard to say exactly, you know how it is when you get older. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty constant the last week or so. Mostly when I lie down, it gets worse. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time does seem to slip away. And lying flat can certainly exacerbate things. Is the cough… productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Oh, goodness. Let me think… does that mean… do I cough anything up? Yes, a little. It’s usually clear, sometimes a bit… foamy, like soap bubbles. Not much, though. It’s not a big, rattling cough, just… persistent. And it tires me out.
DOCTOR: Clear, slightly foamy sputum… alright. And you mentioned your heart feeling heavy. Can you describe that sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like… a fullness, a pressure. Like someone’s sitting on my chest. And sometimes it feels like it’s beating too fast, you know? Like a hummingbird’s wings. It makes me a little breathless just walking to the kitchen. It used to not bother me, but now… it does.
DOCTOR: A fullness and palpitations… and shortness of breath with minimal exertion. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Nadene?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… my feet have been a little puffy lately. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest. I’ve been trying to keep them elevated, but it doesn’t seem to help much. They’re not terribly swollen, but definitely bigger than usual. And my rings feel a little tighter, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Puffy feet, rings feel tighter… alright. Now, have you had any chest pain at all, Nadene?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not really. Like I said, it’s just this… heaviness. Sometimes it feels like a squeezing, but it’s not sharp or anything. More… uncomfortable, like trying to breathe through a thick blanket. And the cough just makes it worse, you know? It feels like it’s rattling everything around in there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems, Nadene?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, the doctor told me I had something called… congestive heart failure. It was about ten years ago, maybe more. I take some pills for it, water pills mostly. And another one… a little white one. I can’t remember the name, I’m afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I take them every day, faithfully. Though, sometimes I forget if I’ve already taken them… It’s a hazard of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’ll figure that out. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I used to get a little itchy with penicillin when I was a child, but I haven’t had that in… well, a very long time. Decades, probably. Other than that, no. I eat everything, too! I’m a cook, you see. Gotta taste everything!
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, if you don't mind. And then I’ll take your blood pressure and check your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My husband always said I was a good patient. He’s been gone ten years now, though. But yes, please, listen away. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me, please. And breathe deeply. Hmm… I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs, and a bit of a murmur. Your heart rate is a little elevated as well. Now, let me check your ankles. Yes, there’s definite swelling here, pitting edema. Your blood pressure is 160 over 90.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I figured something was wrong. My heart feels so heavy, and I’ve been so tired. Is it the heart failure getting worse again, Doctor? Is that what all this means? I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: It does sound like your heart failure may be becoming more pronounced, yes. The congestion in your lungs, the elevated blood pressure, the swelling in your ankles… they all point in that direction. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does require attention. We need to adjust your medication, and possibly do some further testing. I want to order a chest X-ray, and an EKG, and some bloodwork to assess your kidney function and electrolytes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Testing… I don’t mind the testing, I suppose, if it will help. I just… I get nervous with all these things. It reminds me of when my husband… but never mind. What kind of bloodwork? Will it be a lot? And what about the X-ray? Will it hurt? I always worry about radiation. And will the medication change make me feel worse before it makes me feel better?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be nervous, Nadene. It’s perfectly understandable. The bloodwork is fairly routine, just a few vials to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a marker called BNP, which can help us assess the severity of your heart failure. It won’t be a large amount. The X-ray involves a small dose of radiation, but it’s necessary to see the condition of your lungs. The technician will ensure minimal exposure. As for the medication change, it's possible you might feel a little different initially, perhaps some fatigue or dizziness. We'll start with a low dose and monitor you closely. We’ll adjust it as needed to find what works best for you, and I want you to promise me you’ll call if you feel any concerning changes.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a little better, knowing you’ll watch me closely. I promise I will call. I don’t want to end up back in the hospital. That was no fun. Will I be able to drive myself home after all this, Doctor? I don’t want to bother my niece, she’s very busy. And when can I expect to get the results of the tests? Will someone call me, or should I call the office?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll write an order for the lab work and the X-ray. I recommend not driving yourself home today, Nadene. It's best to have someone with you, just in case. We can arrange for a taxi if you prefer. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The lab will notify my office and someone will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you haven't heard anything within 48 hours, please don't hesitate to call the office yourself. I want to make sure you're feeling comfortable and well-informed. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little less worried. I guess I'll just wait for the call then. And try to rest. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. Rest is a good idea. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. My staff and I are here to help. We’ll get you scheduled for those tests right away. Let's get the order to the lab, and then we’ll have the receptionist help you arrange transportation. Have a good day, and remember to take it easy.
