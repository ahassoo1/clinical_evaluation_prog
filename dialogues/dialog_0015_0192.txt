DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s about this… exam. For the army. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it before… well, before anything happens. Seems silly, but rules are rules, I guess.
DOCTOR: An army exam, you say. And you’re needing it completed relatively soon?
PATIENT: Relatively soon? Look, I told that recruiter I could get it done. Don’t really need a lecture on time management, alright? It’s August 2nd. I need to know if you can do it, and when. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard to understand, Mr. Hartness. I simply prefer to have a complete picture of why this exam is needed before proceeding. It helps me understand the scope of what needs to be assessed. But, alright. We'll focus on getting it done. So, besides the fact that it's for the army, is there anything specific they want me to look for?
PATIENT: Specific? No. They just gave me this paper with a list of stuff. Eyes, ears, heart… normal things, I guess. I don’t know. Look, I build engines, alright? Not read medical forms. I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been. Just need a signature so I can get on with things. It’s all a waste of time, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness, but a basic physical exam is standard procedure. It’s for your benefit as much as theirs. It ensures you are physically capable of performing the duties required. Now, let's start with your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? No. A few colds, maybe. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Nothing a cast couldn’t fix. Don’t see how that matters now. I haven't been sick a day in my life, honestly. I eat good, work hard. That’s all there is to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I can eat anything. Anything at all. I like strong food. Spicy food. Don't bother me with allergies. A waste of my time, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I told you, I don't take anything. I work with my hands, alright? Not stuff pills down my throat. Perfectly fine. No pills, no vitamins, no… whatever you're asking about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Family history? My dad built engines. My grandpa built engines. My mother… she cooked. Nobody got sick. They worked hard, lived good lives. Normal people. Didn’t spend their time worrying about… diseases. It’s a waste.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, even if you don’t find this information relevant, it's a standard part of a medical evaluation. It helps me assess your overall risk factors. Now, please, just tell me if anyone in your family has had a serious medical condition. Yes or no is sufficient. Did your parents or siblings suffer from heart disease?
PATIENT: Fine. My dad… he smoked too much. Didn’t kill him, but he coughed a lot. That’s it. Nothing else. Happy now? Can we please just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. I’m going to start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we’ll move on to a basic examination of your eyes, ears, heart, and lungs. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? This is ridiculous. I feel like I’m wasting a perfectly good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are… slightly muffled. I'll need to listen again. Hmm. There's a very faint murmur.
PATIENT: Murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? I told you, I’m perfectly healthy! This is… this is probably just your equipment. It’s probably broken or something. I’ve never had any problems with my heart. Never.
DOCTOR: A murmur is an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem, but it warrants further investigation. And I assure you, my equipment is functioning perfectly well. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your eyes. Vision is 20/25 in both eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes appear normal.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is there something wrong with me? I need to know. Don’t just poke and prod and write things down. Tell me what’s happening! I have a recruitment exam to pass, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your anxiety, but a diagnosis cannot be made based on a cursory examination. The murmur I detected requires further investigation. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the presence of the murmur, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart's electrical activity. We should also consider a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions. And frankly, given your weight… it's significantly below what is considered healthy for your height. This alone warrants further assessment. I'll write the orders for these tests. You can schedule them at the lab downstairs.
PATIENT: Are you serious? An EKG? A chest X-ray? Because I'm a little thin? This is a waste of time and money! I don’t have time for this! I came here for a signature, not a full medical workup! This is ridiculous. I’m perfectly fine. You’re trying to find something that isn’t there! I need to speak to someone else. A different doctor. Someone who understands what a healthy person looks like. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I am obligated to ensure your health and safety. Dismissing potential concerns based on your personal opinion is irresponsible and unethical. While I understand your frustration, I will not compromise my professional judgment. I will not provide a signature for your recruitment exam without proper assessment. You are welcome to seek a second opinion, but I assure you, I am acting in your best interest. I’ve written the orders for the EKG and chest X-ray. Scheduling information is at the front desk. Please schedule those tests. If you refuse to undergo these basic assessments, I cannot, and will not, sign off on your physical. .
PATIENT: Ridiculous... completely ridiculous. Fine! Fine! I’ll do your stupid tests! But don't expect me to be happy about it. This is a waste of my time and money… a complete and utter waste. .
