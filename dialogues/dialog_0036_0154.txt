DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They’ve been giving me trouble again. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been happening on and off for a while now. I just want it to stop, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Wease. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “trouble,” can you tell me more specifically what’s been happening with your waterworks?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… I have to go to the little girls’ room… a lot. And it… burns. A burning feeling when I… go. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a little bit of… a different color. Not right, you understand. I don’t like it. I try to drink lots of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Honestly, I just…feel tired all the time because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, thank you for sharing that with me. So, frequent urination, burning sensation with urination, and you’ve noticed a change in the color of your urine at times, and feeling tired. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how much more frequently you're going compared to what’s normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. I don’t keep track of things like that. It just feels like all the time. More than usual, certainly. Before… well, before all this, I could go a normal amount of hours without needing to go. Now? It’s… every couple of hours, maybe less. Sometimes I wake up in the night too, which is very disruptive. I don’t remember it being this bad before, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know it’s significantly different than your usual pattern, and waking you up at night is concerning. And it's perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. Let’s try to get a little more information. Have you noticed any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Lower… abdomen? Oh… sometimes. A sort of ache, not a sharp pain. It comes and goes. And, yes, sometimes in my back too. Not all the time, but when I’m… having the trouble with my waterworks, it’s worse. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And makes me feel… well, old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, an ache in your lower abdomen and back that coincides with your urinary symptoms. Thank you for letting me know. Now, have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: Fever… Oh, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt feverish. No chills. No… throwing up, either. Just the tiredness. A lot of tiredness. And… this constant feeling of needing to go. It’s… draining, honestly. I just want to feel normal again. I don't remember ever feeling this bad before.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, Ms. Wease. Alright, let's move on to some other questions, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any history of kidney problems, bladder infections, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a long time ago. I… I don’t really recall. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. But… I don’t remember them saying anything about my kidneys. I had a little trouble with something… a stomach thing, I think, a long time ago, but that’s all I can remember. And I had my gallbladder removed… years and years ago. But… nothing about my waterworks before this. Honestly, I have a terrible memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, that’s helpful to know. Gallbladder removal in the past. No specific history of kidney or bladder problems that you recall. Let’s talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have a history of kidney disease, bladder problems, or frequent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s… tricky. My mother… she had a lot of ailments. I don’t recall specifically anything about kidneys. And my brother… he lived in Spain, and I didn't see him much. We didn’t really talk about health things. I just… I don't know. I suppose it’s possible someone had something, but I can’t remember for certain. My memory is just… terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, that’s alright. We’ll proceed without specific family history for now. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small white pill. And… sometimes I take something for aches and pains. Just when they're really bad. Nothing regularly. Oh, and sometimes a vitamin D tablet. My daughter reminds me. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, so you’re taking a medication for blood pressure, a pain reliever occasionally, and a Vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. No allergies. I’m thankful for that. I’m trying to think… but no, I don’t think so. I'm usually pretty good with remembering if something makes me sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease, that’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and I'll also need to check a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. Listening to my tummy doesn't sound very pleasant, but… if it will help. And a water sample… yes, I can do that. Just tell me where to go. I just want this to be over with, honestly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. I just need to listen for any unusual sounds, and the urine sample will give us a lot of information. If you'll follow me, there's a private restroom just over here. I'll give you a cup, and I’ll explain how to collect the sample. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. Then, we'll come back here, and I’ll do a quick examination of your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… mid-stream. That sounds… complicated. But alright, I’ll try. I hope it’s not too difficult. I just… want to be done with this, honestly. The sooner I can go, the better. Please, just tell me exactly what to do. I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. It's not complicated, I promise. Here's the cup. When you're ready, just start urinating like normal. Let a little bit go into the toilet first, then collect the sample mid-stream – that means when you're flowing steadily. Then finish in the toilet as usual. It’s just to get a cleaner sample. Take your time, and don't rush. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Just knock when you’re ready, and we'll come back here.
PATIENT: Alright. Mid-stream… start, then not, then start… I think. Oh dear. I hope I can manage this. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… I'll go now.
