DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Segretto, yes, that’s me. Well, it’s this… this needing to go to the bathroom. All the time, it feels like. Not painful, exactly, just… frequent. It’s getting old, I’ll tell ya. Used to be able to go a good stretch without a fuss. Now… now it’s just constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. And you said it's not painful, just… inconvenient and a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent-ish, yes. Hard to say how recent, to be honest. Things blur after a while, you know? My wife, bless her heart, she noticed it first. Said I was disappearing to the bathroom every hour or so. Before that… well, I don’t rightly recall. It's not like it happened overnight. Just… crept up on me, I suppose. Is this something serious, Doctor? I don’t want any of those… procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto, and it’s good your wife noticed. It’s certainly good you’re addressing it now. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when things changed, that’s alright. We’ll try to figure it out. “Creeping up on you” is a good way to describe it. Frequent urination can have a lot of causes, some very simple, some that need a bit more investigation. We’ll start with some questions to get a better picture, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam. To start, can you tell me about how much you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Drink, you say? Well, I like my coffee in the mornings. Always have. Maybe… three, four cups? And I have some water with lunch, usually. And a glass or two with dinner. Not a huge amount, I wouldn't say. Not like some folks, gulping down those big bottles all day. I mostly drink when I'm thirsty, if that makes sense. It's not like I'm forcing myself to drink a gallon a day. Why, is that a problem? Is coffee causing this?
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three to four cups of coffee a day, and some water with meals. That’s helpful. Coffee can sometimes contribute to needing to urinate more often, as it's a mild diuretic – meaning it makes your body get rid of more fluids. But it’s not usually the only cause, especially if this is a recent change. Do you notice if it’s worse at night?
PATIENT: At night… Hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. I do get up once, sometimes twice, to go to the bathroom. Used to sleep right through, didn't have to think about it. Now I wake up needing to go. It doesn't keep me up all night, but it's enough to disrupt things. My wife doesn’t mind too much, but I sure do. I like a good night’s sleep, you know? I used to be able to work a full day on six hours, but now… I need my rest. Is this a sign of something bad? Are my kidneys going bad? My brother had some trouble with those years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up once or twice a night to urinate is definitely something to consider. And it’s good you mention your brother’s kidney issues - family history is important. It’s good you’re thinking about that. No, not necessarily bad, but we want to rule things out. Waking up at night could be related to several things, not just kidney problems. It could be something as simple as drinking too much fluid before bed, or it could be a sign of a few other things. Do you have any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well... let me think. I'm not sick, you know? No fever, no pain… I feel alright, mostly. My back aches a little sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. And my knees, don’t even get me started on my knees. But no, nothing specifically with the bathroom, other than needing to go all the time. Maybe… sometimes it feels like I don’t quite empty it all the way? Like there’s a little bit left in there, even after I go. Is that… normal? I don't know anymore what’s normal these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no pain, and some back ache that you attribute to age. And you sometimes feel like you don’t fully empty your bladder, even after urinating. That’s helpful information. It's good you're letting me know these things, even if they seem small. We'll try to get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the color? You mean like, is it darker or lighter? I haven't been paying close attention, to be honest. I glance at it, of course, to make sure everything looks… normal. But I haven't been checking for specific changes, if that makes sense. It's usually… yellow, I suppose. Sometimes a little darker if I haven't had enough to drink. But no blood, no foam, nothing unusual that I’ve noticed. My wife does most of the noticing, to be frank. I just go, and she worries about the rest. Is there something I should be looking for? I don't understand why everything is so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Segretto, it's perfectly normal not to be scrutinizing your urine daily. Knowing you haven't noticed any blood or unusual changes is good. Let’s move on to some other questions. Have you had any recent illnesses or infections, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see. I had a bit of a cough last winter, a nasty one. But that was ages ago, maybe six months or more. Nothing since then, thankfully. My wife always tells me to stay away from folks who are sick, and I usually do. I don't like being ill. It just knocks the stuffing right out of you. And no, I haven't been to the hospital or anything recently. Just my regular check-ups with Dr. Henderson, but he didn't mention anything about my bladder. Now, what’s this all about? I just want to be able to sleep through the night again, that's all. Is there a pill for this?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had a cough about six months ago, but nothing recent. And you haven't been to the hospital recently. I understand wanting to sleep through the night, and we’ll work towards that. There are medications that can help, but we need to figure out why you’re getting up so often before we jump to a solution. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. And I broke my arm when I was a teenager, playing football. Stupid idea, that was. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose. I’ve always been a hard worker, stayed active on the farm. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it's managed with a little pill. Nothing major, nothing that keeps me down. My wife keeps track of all that, to be honest. I just take the pills when she tells me to. Why do you need to know all this, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, a broken arm, and high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. It's important to understand the full picture. It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Segretto, but knowing your history helps me determine the best course of action. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: Surgeries...let me think. No, not that I recall. I’ve always been one to avoid doctors, if I can help it. And I certainly haven't been under the knife for anything. My wife might know better, she's the one who keeps track of all these things. But no, I don't think I've had any surgeries. I've always been pretty sturdy, never needed much fixing. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have some chores to get back to. The tomatoes need staking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That’s good to know. And no, this isn’t taking too long, Mr. Segretto. I understand you have chores to get back to. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Medications... hmm. Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. I take one every morning with my coffee. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands when they’re really aching, but that’s just over-the-counter stuff. Nothing fancy. And occasionally, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something my wife gives me, but it's not regularly. She has a whole cabinet full of things. I don’t really pay attention to the names, to be honest. I just take what she gives me. Is that bad? Should I be keeping track of this stuff? Everything's so complicated these days...
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication daily, over-the-counter arthritis relief when needed, and something for sleep occasionally prescribed by your wife. It's okay that you’re not sure of the names, we can sort that out. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history...Well, my father had heart trouble, that's for sure. Ended up with a bad ticker. And my brother, like I said, had some trouble with his kidneys. And my mother, she had diabetes. Not a very healthy bunch, to be honest. Mostly good, strong farmers, but not much in the way of good health. My wife always says I'm lucky to be still kicking. She worries about me, you know. Is that the kind of thing that matters, Doctor? Is this bladder trouble something I inherited?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father, kidney trouble in your brother, and diabetes in your mother. That’s good information. It is helpful to know, yes, as some conditions can be inherited. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I'm a farmer. Always have been, always will be, I reckon. Retired, but still get out there when I can. Not much sitting around, I can tell you that. I used to smoke a pipe, but I gave that up years ago. Drink a little bit with dinner sometimes, a glass of wine or a beer. Not a heavy drinker, never was. And I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables from the garden. My wife is good about that, makes sure I don't eat too much junk. But mostly, I just work, sleep, and try to stay out of trouble. Is that good enough? Am I doing something wrong?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active and healthy lifestyle, Mr. Segretto, especially for your age. No, you don't sound like you're doing anything wrong! Okay, one last question for now. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, or anything like that. And I've never reacted badly to any of the pills the doctor has given me. My wife always asks me about that, but I always tell her no. I think I would know if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I? Is that everything, Doctor? I'm starting to get a little fidgety. Those tomatoes won't stake themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Mr. Segretto, that’s all the questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing frequent urination, possibly with incomplete emptying, and waking up at night to urinate. Given your family history of kidney trouble and diabetes, and your age, it's important to investigate this further. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, including checking your abdomen and doing a digital rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam?! Oh, now just a minute. That doesn't sound pleasant at all! Is that really necessary? I mean, I’m not having any trouble down there, if you catch my drift. Couldn't we skip that part? I’m an old man, Doctor, I don’t need… all that poking around. I came here about my bladder, not… well, you know. Are you sure it’s absolutely necessary? I just want to be able to sleep through the night again, that’s all. Honestly, it sounds a bit intrusive. I think I might just live with it, if it comes to that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Segretto, and I apologize for suggesting something that feels intrusive. It’s not something I take lightly. The reason I suggest it is to check the prostate gland. As men age, the prostate can enlarge, which can put pressure on the bladder and cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, especially at night. It's a very quick exam, and it helps us rule out a common cause of these issues. However, it’s your body, and you have the right to refuse any procedure you’re not comfortable with. We can proceed without it, but it would mean we’d need to rely more heavily on other tests, like a urine analysis and potentially a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. I can explain those tests in more detail if you'd like. And if at any point you change your mind about the exam, please let me know. What would you prefer to do?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… that’s something I hadn’t thought about. An enlarged prostate, eh? My brother never mentioned anything about that. Still… I don’t like the sound of poking around down there. But you’re right, I suppose, I want to get to the bottom of this. And if it means avoiding other tests… Alright, go ahead. But be quick about it, and gentle, if you can. And don't be offended if I flinch a little. I'm not used to this sort of thing. But if this is what it takes, I guess I'll cooperate. Just… warn me before you do anything, alright? And tell me what you're looking for. I like to know what’s going on, even if I don't understand it. Just… get it over with, please. And then maybe we can talk about those pills.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I completely understand your apprehension, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go, and warn you before each step. I’m looking for any abnormalities in the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. It will give us some insight into whether it might be contributing to your urinary symptoms. Okay. If you could just lie on your side, with your knees bent towards your chest. I will let you know when I am about to begin. Please relax as much as possible. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… hurry it up, please. And warn me, like you said. I’m not a fan of surprises. And if it hurts, I want to know about it. I’ve got a low pain tolerance, you know. Old age, probably. Just… get it over with. This is very undignified. I should have just lived with the frequent urination.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto, just take a few deep breaths. I’m going to apply a little lubricant, and then I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. Here we go. Just relax your muscles… deep breaths. Okay, that’s all done. Just relax for a moment. Okay, Mr. Segretto. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it’s not overly firm or irregular. It’s not immediately alarming, but it does help explain your symptoms. Now, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to get a more complete picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't too bad, I suppose. But I still don’t like it. Slightly enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Do I need surgery? My brother had all sorts of trouble with his kidneys, and I don't want to end up like him. A urine analysis and a blood test, you say? Alright, fine. If it gets me closer to sleeping through the night, I'll do it. But what are we looking for, exactly? I want to know everything. And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. I have chores to do, you know. Tomatoes don't stake themselves, and the weeds are getting out of control. Just tell me what's going on, Doctor, and what I need to do. And be quick about it, please. I'm an old man, and I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Segretto, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Slightly enlarged prostate is very common as men age. It's not necessarily serious, and most men don't require surgery. The enlargement can put pressure on the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder, causing the symptoms you’re experiencing – frequent urination, especially at night. The urine analysis will help us look for any infection or blood in your urine. The blood test will check your kidney function, prostate-specific antigen level – a marker that can be elevated in some prostate conditions – and your blood sugar levels, to rule out diabetes. I’m ordering both tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to drink a moderate amount of fluids, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. And please, don't worry too much. We're just gathering information at this point. We'll discuss the results and develop a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Moderate fluids… No caffeine… No alcohol… It's always something, isn't it? Alright, fine. I’ll try. But it's going to be hard. A little glass of wine with dinner is all I ask. So, no surgery yet? That’s good. I don’t want any of those procedures. And 24-48 hours, you say? I’ll be waiting by the phone. Just call me as soon as you know something, alright? Don't keep me in suspense. And if the results show something serious… what then? What are my options? I want to know everything upfront. I don’t like surprises. Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beating around the bush. I'm an old man, and I’ve seen it all. I want to know what I'm up against. And what I need to do about it. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all? Just tell me everything, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, I understand your anxiety and your desire for transparency. I promise to be upfront with you. If the results show a significant elevation in your PSA, or if the urine analysis reveals an infection, we may need to consider further investigation, such as a referral to a urologist – a specialist in urinary conditions. They may recommend additional tests, like an MRI or a prostate biopsy, to determine the cause of the enlargement and develop a treatment plan. Treatment options vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. They can range from watchful waiting and lifestyle modifications to medication, such as alpha-blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, to more invasive procedures, like transurethral resection of the prostate , which involves removing a portion of the prostate gland. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Most men with slightly enlarged prostates do not require invasive treatment. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild medication to help relax your bladder muscles. It may help reduce your frequent urination and improve your sleep. Here’s the prescription, along with some information about the medication and potential side effects. If you experience any side effects, please call my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A mild medication, eh? More pills… Just what I needed. Side effects… everything has side effects these days. Alright, fine. I’ll try it. But if it makes me feel worse, I’m stopping it. And if it doesn't work, I don't want any more pills. I suppose… no, I don’t think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being straight with me, and for not beating around the bush. I appreciate that. It’s hard enough getting old without having to deal with a bunch of… well, you know. I think that’s all for now. I’d better get home. Those tomatoes aren’t going to stake themselves, and the weeds are getting out of control. I’ll be waiting by the phone. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Take care of those tomatoes. .
