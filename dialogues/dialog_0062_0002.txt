DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not easy like before. It takes a long time, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having some difficulty with urination – it's taking longer and feels more difficult than it used to. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Hard. It’s… like something is blocking it, maybe? Not pain, exactly. Just… stuck. And I have to… push a lot. My husband, he says I take too long in there. He’s a good man, but he doesn’t understand. It just… doesn’t go easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like you're having trouble emptying your bladder completely, and you need to strain to get it all out. No pain, just a sensation of being blocked or stuck. And it's taking longer than usual. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been getting gradually worse?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t happen all at once. Maybe… a few months now? It's hard to say for sure, time goes so fast when you get old. I just noticed it was taking longer and longer each time. Not a big thing at first, but now… well, now it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual change over a few months. And it's become more bothersome recently. Have you noticed any other changes when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. Sometimes… I feel like I have to go, really bad, and then… not much comes out. Just a little. And sometimes, when I’m done, I feel like there’s still some left. Like I didn’t get everything out. Does that make sense? I don't know all the words to explain it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Zoie. So, you're experiencing a sense of urgency – feeling like you need to go frequently – but then only a small amount comes out. And you have a feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any leaking or dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Leaking…? Oh, sometimes. Just a little, when I stand up. Not a lot, but enough to… you know. Enough to change my clothes sometimes. It’s… annoying, mostly. And I don't like to go out much when it's happening. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've experienced some urgency, incomplete emptying, and some leakage after you urinate. That's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the pee? Well, it looks normal, I think. Yellow, like it should be. Sometimes a little darker if I don't drink enough water, but that’s all. No blood, no funny smells… I don't think so. I haven't really been looking, to be honest. I just go when I have to go. Is something wrong with the color? Should I be looking?
DOCTOR: No, no, you’re fine not specifically looking! I was just checking for anything unusual. So, no blood or changes in smell. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Back pain… sometimes. But I always have a little back pain, you know? Old age. It’s just… there. Not sharp, not anything new with this bathroom problem. Just… my back. I get it rubbed sometimes, that helps. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have chronic back pain that isn’t new or related to the urinary issues. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. My husband handles all the doctor things, mostly. I know I went to the hospital once, a long time ago, for my heart. But they fixed it. I take pills for it, still. And… the doctor said something about my blood pressure, but I don’t remember exactly. I take pills for that too, I think. He keeps track of it all. I get Medicare, so I see doctors often enough. I don't mean to be difficult, dear. It's just… a lot of years go by.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It's very common for patients to have a lot going on, and it's helpful that you're seeing doctors regularly. We can review your medications and medical history through your Medicare records. Just one moment… Okay, it looks like you have a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a type of irregular heartbeat, and you are on medication for that. You also have been diagnosed with hypertension, or high blood pressure, and take medication for that as well. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee, when I was younger. They fixed it, but it hurts sometimes, especially when it rains. Old war wounds, you know? Nothing major, I don’t think. It was all a long time ago. My husband would know the dates, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a knee surgery. And your family – do you have any family history of bladder problems, kidney problems, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she had trouble with her legs when she got old. Swelling, mostly. And my brother… he had something with his kidneys, I think. But he didn't take care of himself. He drank too much. I don't know much about it. It was a long time ago. My sisters were healthy, I think. Mostly. Everyone dies of something, doesn't they? It’s hard to remember details after so many years. I'm sorry I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Zoie. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, dear. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol. A little wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all. My husband likes his beer, but I don’t. It makes me feel funny. I like my tea, mostly. And I try to drink plenty of water, like the doctor tells me. Not always easy, though. Sometimes I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Just one last thing – do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any trouble with any medicines, not that I remember. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain lotions, but that’s all. Nothing serious. My husband always tells the doctor if I’ve had a reaction to anything. He's very careful. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything important. It’s been a long time and I've taken a lot of different things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, that’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also do a quick abdominal exam to check your bladder. Then, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to make sure everything is working as it should. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just tell me if it will hurt. My back gets sore easily, so be gentle, please. But do whatever you need to do to help me feel better. I want to be able to go out and enjoy my life again.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Hmm… not much tenderness. I'm feeling your bladder now... it feels a little full, but no significant pain. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, dear. Here you go. Be careful, my legs aren’t what they used to be. I get a little shaky sometimes, so don’t mind if I wobble a bit. Just do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, just relax. Hmm… your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for your age, but they’re symmetrical. And no signs of weakness. Now, I’m just going to have you do a quick squeeze with your hands. Good, good. Strength is good. Everything seems normal so far. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and other problems. We may also need a post-void residual volume test, where we measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. And depending on the results, we might need to consider further testing, like an ultrasound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. A test sounds good. I just want to know what’s wrong, so I can get it fixed. And I trust your judgement. So, a test, and then… maybe an ultrasound? If you think it's necessary. Just let me know what I need to do. And please, don't rush me. I'm an old woman, you know, it takes me a little longer to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, absolutely. We’ll take our time. First, we'll do the urine test, which is just a simple sample. The nurse will help you with that. Then, we’ll schedule the post-void residual volume test – it just involves urinating normally, and then a quick scan to see how much urine is left. I'm also going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes. Based on your symptoms and the exam, my initial impression is that you might have overactive bladder with incomplete emptying. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, medication side effects, and underlying medical conditions. But we need the test results to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, like a urinary tract infection or a blockage. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that makes sense. Overactive bladder… and incomplete emptying. It sounds… complicated. But I trust you. You’re the doctor. And I appreciate you explaining it to me, even if I don’t understand all the words. So, a test, blood work, and then… we’ll see what happens? Is that right? I just hope it’s not something too serious. I want to keep enjoying my life, you know? It’s been a long one, and I don’t want it to end now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly right, Zoie. Test, blood work, and then we’ll see what happens. We’ll take it one step at a time. And I understand your concerns. It’s good that we’re getting this checked out. Based on what you’ve told me, it’s unlikely to be anything too serious, but it’s important to rule everything out. In the meantime, let’s focus on some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. First, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids – about 6-8 glasses of water a day. Second, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. Third, try to urinate regularly, even if you don’t feel the urge. And fourth, consider doing some pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to strengthen your bladder muscles. I can give you a handout with instructions on how to do these. We'll also look at your medications to see if any of them could be contributing to your symptoms. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the test results and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… that's a lot to remember! Six glasses of water, no caffeine, regular bathroom trips… and exercises? My memory isn't what it used to be. I'll try, but I might need a little help from my husband. He's good at reminding me of things. And a handout would be lovely, yes. So I can look at it later. One question… what if I can't get to the bathroom in time? I worry about accidents, you know. It's embarrassing. And… will these exercises really help? I'm an old woman, my muscles aren't very strong anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Zoie. It's a lot to take in, and it's okay to need help remembering things. We can absolutely involve your husband in the process. And we’ll take things at your pace. Regarding accidents, that's a valid concern. There are things we can do to help manage that. We can discuss bladder training techniques to help you increase the time between bathroom trips. And there are also absorbent products available if needed. We don't want you to be embarrassed or worry about that. As for the exercises, it's true that your muscles might not be as strong as they used to be, but that doesn't mean they can't be strengthened. Kegel exercises are very effective, even for older women. They work by strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, which help control urination. It takes time and effort, but many women see significant improvement with regular exercise. I'll give you a handout with instructions, and the nurse can show you the proper technique. We can also refer you to a pelvic floor physical therapist if you'd like. Does that help ease your worries a little?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that does help. Knowing there are things we can do… and that I'm not alone… that's a comfort. And the handout would be lovely. And maybe the physical therapist, if it helps. My husband will be glad to hear about all of this. He worries about me too. I think… I think I'm ready to get started. It won't be easy, but I want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to go out and enjoy my life without worrying about accidents. Thank you, dear. You've been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it. Now, tell me about this test… what do I have to do? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. I’m glad I could help. And I admire your determination – that’s exactly what we need! The test is a simple urine sample. The nurse will give you a cup and instructions on how to collect it. It's best to collect a midstream sample, which means you start urinating, then collect the sample midstream, and finish urinating. That helps ensure we get an accurate result. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process the sample. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll also order the blood work today, and those results usually take about the same amount of time. The nurse will go over all the instructions with you. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, dear, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I'll just wait for the nurse, and then we'll get started. Thank you again, dear. You've been a lifesaver. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Now, I best be going. I have a husband waiting for me, and he's probably worried sick. Thank you, dear. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have the nurse come in to go over the instructions with you. And please, take your time. Goodbye, Zoie. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
