DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring. My skin, you see. It’s… yellowing. Quite noticeable, really. My friend insisted I come in. I don’t recall all the details, something about my liver… and perhaps a sickness I once had? It’s all rather muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yellowing skin… I see. And you suspect it’s related to a previous illness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what I believe. Though, what was that illness… it escapes me. It was some time ago, of course. A very long time. I’m… not good with dates or remembering specifics, Doctor. Is it important what the illness was? Perhaps you have my records?
DOCTOR: Let's take a look. Hmm… according to this, you were diagnosed with hepatitis A in 1978. Is that ringing any bells?
PATIENT: 1978… Goodness. That is a long time ago. Hepatitis… Yes, vaguely. I remember being very unwell. A great deal of fatigue. But the details… it’s like looking at a faded photograph. I do recall being quite ill, though. And spending a good deal of time in bed. Is that… relevant to this yellowing, Doctor? It all feels so disconnected.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Ms. Durig. Hepatitis A, while often resolving completely, can sometimes cause lasting effects, or in rare cases, lead to chronic liver issues. However, there are many other possibilities. We need to investigate further. Let's start with a thorough examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your eyes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I’d prefer to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have… commitments. A feeling I’m forgetting something important, you see. Though I can’t quite place it. Please, proceed with the examination.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin. Please lie back on the examination table. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. This may be slightly uncomfortable, so please let me know if you experience any pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Just… right there, on the right side. Not sharp pain, exactly. More… a dull ache. It’s been there for a few days, I think. It’s difficult to say for certain. I don’t usually pay much attention to aches and pains, you see. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing serious. Perhaps it’s just… old age?
DOCTOR: A dull ache in the right upper quadrant… I see. It could be related to several things, Ms. Durig. It’s certainly worth investigating further. Now, let's check your eyes. Looking straight ahead… good. Any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. My vision hasn’t been… spectacular for years, you understand. Just the usual, a little blurry around the edges. I wear glasses, of course. But no… no recent changes. It’s… everything feels so distant, Doctor. Like I’m observing my own life from a great distance. Is this examination… nearly over?
DOCTOR: I do notice some mild jaundice in your sclera – the whites of your eyes. That explains the yellowing you mentioned. And your skin also appears slightly jaundiced. Alright, Ms. Durig. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, we need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your liver function, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, blood tests are fine. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. As long as we can… resolve this quickly. Is it a lot of blood? I… dislike needles. And all this talk of livers and bilirubins… it’s rather frightening, to be honest. I’m simply an old woman, Doctor. I just want to feel… normal again. Can the results be back quickly?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw, Ms. Durig. Just a few vials, and it will be over before you know it. It’s not a pleasant experience, I understand, but it’s necessary. As for the results, we should have them back within 24-48 hours. We'll order the tests now. In the meantime, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, medications, and lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I… believe I had a reaction to penicillin once, a very long time ago. A rash, I think. But honestly, Doctor, my memory is terribly unreliable. It was so long ago. I can’t recall the specifics. And medications… I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but I can’t recall the name. My daughter usually manages those things. Would it be easier to… contact her? It's all very confusing. I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will note a possible penicillin allergy. We can certainly try to contact your daughter, though it may delay things. It's important to have an accurate medication list. Now, Ms. Durig, I understand your memory isn’t what it once was, but it's crucial you attempt to recall any medications you’re taking. Even over-the-counter remedies. Do you take anything for pain, sleep, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No… no, I don’t think so. Just… a little chamomile tea sometimes, for sleep. And perhaps an antacid, when my stomach bothers me. Nothing… regular. I assure you, Doctor. I don’t take much. I try to avoid medications, if possible. They always make me feel… unwell. Is this… is this taking much longer? I have an appointment, you see. Though, I’ve forgotten what it is. Perhaps my daughter knows. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. We will proceed with the blood tests and attempt to contact your daughter for clarification. In the meantime, please try to think of anything else that might be relevant. I will have the nurse draw your blood now. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
