DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… my ear, mostly. Feels… blocked. Like something’s full of cotton, maybe? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear that's been going on for a while. And you mentioned feeling a bit fuzzy – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Fuzzy… yeah. Not just the ear, really. Hard to… focus, sometimes. Like things aren't quite… clear. I just thought it was… getting older, to be honest. It's not painful, just… there. And the ear feels worse when it's quiet, I think. Like… noticing it more. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. It’s helpful to know it’s not painful, and that it’s more noticeable when quiet. The feeling of fuzziness is good to note as well. So, to clarify, the ear blockage and this feeling of fuzziness… did they start around the same time, or did one come before the other?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s… a good question. Honestly? I really can’t remember. It all feels… blended together. Maybe the ear first? No, wait… maybe not. My wife… she passed a couple of years ago now, and things have been… a bit of a blur since then. I'm really sorry, that’s probably not helpful at all. I wish I could give you a straight answer. Is it important which one came first?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know that context, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It absolutely explains why it’s difficult to pinpoint timing. No need to apologize at all. We can work with what you do remember. So, let's focus on the ear for now. Besides the feeling of fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. No pain, like I said. No… discharge, or anything like that. Sometimes it feels a little… itchy, deep inside. And, now that you mention it, I think my hearing is a little… muffled in that ear. Not completely gone, just… quieter. I mostly listen to the radio, so I haven’t really noticed it much. Is that… normal? Honestly, I just try not to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or discharge, some itchiness, and slightly muffled hearing. That's helpful. And it's good you mention you mostly listen to the radio, as that would explain why the hearing loss hasn’t been as noticeable. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, ringing, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ringing… maybe? When I was a kid, I think. Something about being too close to a tractor. But nothing serious. I had… ear infections a few times as a little boy, probably. Just the usual stuff, I guess. My mother… she always gave me some drops. I don’t remember much about it, though. It was a long time ago. Does that help? I’m really trying, Doctor. This whole thing is just… irritating. It's not bad bad, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. Ear infections as a child and some possible ringing from childhood noise exposure are good to know. And I understand it’s irritating, not necessarily debilitating, but persistent. Alright. I’d like to take a quick look at your ear, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve me using an otoscope to look inside. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you think is best. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. Go ahead. It doesn't bother me, really. Just… quick if you can? I’ve got some… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, looking at your right ear… the ear canal appears a little narrowed, and there's some cerumen – earwax – present, but not excessive. The tympanic membrane – that’s the eardrum – appears slightly dull and retracted. On the left side, the ear canal is clearer, but the tympanic membrane also looks a little dull and retracted. There's no visible sign of infection or fluid behind the eardrums. It looks like you have a bit of impacted cerumen in both ears, which could be contributing to the blockage and the muffled hearing. The retracted appearance of the eardrums… that's something we should investigate further. Do you have any allergies to ear drops?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, really. My wife… she was the one with allergies. Pollen, mostly. I just… stayed inside with her. No, no allergies. But… are you going to put something in my ear? I don't like things in my ear. Not a fan, at all. Could we… maybe not?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's perfectly reasonable to not like things in your ear. We can definitely discuss alternatives. Removing the earwax with ear drops is usually the first step, as it can often resolve the blockage and improve your hearing. However, if you're strongly opposed to it, we can consider other options, like a referral to an audiologist for a more thorough hearing assessment and manual wax removal. Given your mention of the fuzziness you're experiencing, and the retracted eardrums, I’d also like to suggest a simple hearing test – just to get a baseline and rule out any other underlying issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A hearing test… yeah, alright. That sounds… less invasive. And if it rules things out, that's good. I’m not keen on anything going in my ear, honestly. Especially not after my wife… she had trouble with her ears, and it was never a good experience. So, hearing test first. Then… maybe we can talk about other options? I'm really trying to be cooperative, Doctor. Just… slow and steady. Please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Slow and steady is perfectly fine. I completely understand your concerns, especially given your wife's experience. We’ll start with the hearing test. Our audiologist, Sarah Chen, is excellent. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for an appointment. It's a painless procedure; you'll just wear headphones and listen to tones. It will take about 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, can you tell me about your current medications, if any?
PATIENT: Medications… uh… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, doctor prescribed it a couple of years back. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. And… vitamins. A multivitamin, every morning. Does that count? Nothing else. I used to take something for… aches and pains, but I stopped. Didn’t seem to be doing much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know. And it’s good you discontinued the medication for aches and pains if it wasn’t effective. Before we finish, just a couple of quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife… she didn't like it. And I never had the urge, to be honest. Always thought it was a silly habit. No, never a smoker. A bit of a drinker, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. Definitely not a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That’s good information. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, that’s everything for now. I've made a note to schedule you for a hearing test with Sarah Chen. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action for your ear blockage and the feeling of fuzziness. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like pain, discharge, fever, or sudden hearing loss – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. Just… the hearing test, right? And… don't put anything in my ear, please? I appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. Things are just a bit… scrambled these days. And thank you for listening. It helps, just talking about it. I think. Hopefully, this hearing test will give us some answers. Can I just… get on with it then? I have some… gardening to do, and the weeds won’t pull themselves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No need to apologize at all. And absolutely no putting anything in your ear without your explicit consent. We will proceed with the hearing test first. I've already made a note of your preference. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the appointment. And I'm glad talking about it helps. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I hope you enjoy your gardening! .
