DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's about my family. Lots of bad sickness, you see. My mother... and her sister... both had... trouble. I want to make sure I don't get it, if that makes sense. Just... peace of mind, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. “Peace of mind” is a perfectly good reason to come in. Could you tell me a little more about the “trouble” your mother and aunt experienced?
PATIENT: Well... my mother, she had... problems with her thinking. Forgot things. Got confused. It got worse and worse, you know? And her sister... she was very tired all the time. Doctor said it was... something with her heart, I think. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember everything. It made them very sick, though. Very sad.
DOCTOR: I see. So, memory problems with your mother and fatigue and heart issues with your aunt. That gives us a starting point. To help me understand what might be going on with you, could you tell me a bit about your own health?
PATIENT: Well... I try to eat okay. Not much fast food. Mostly just... regular food. I walk a bit, not a lot. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t, right? I’m… 73 years old! I haven’t been really sick, like in the hospital, for a long time. Just… little things. A cold now and then. Nothing serious. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you generally take care of yourself. And Medicare is helpful information, thank you. Let's talk a little more about this fatigue you mentioned. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm... it’s hard to say exactly. Maybe a few years now? It’s not… all the time. Some days I feel okay. But lately… it seems to be happening more often. I get tired just… doing things around the house. Little things, you know? Like… mowing the lawn. Or… going to the store. It didn’t used to bother me so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the fatigue is relatively recent, and it's impacting your daily activities. That's helpful information. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Not a lot. Just… a little tremble in my hands. And… I think I’ve been a little more forgetful lately, but… I’m 73, like I said! Is that normal? I forget where I put my keys sometimes. Or… what I was going to say, mid-sentence. It's annoying, but... is that just getting old?
DOCTOR: Those are important things to mention, Mr. Schwer. The shakiness and increased forgetfulness are things we need to explore. It's good you’re bringing them up. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment – just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That sounds… good. I guess. If you think it will help. I just want to make sure I'm okay. Like my mother... and my aunt. I don’t want… that. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. We’ll take things slowly and do what’s necessary. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit on the slower side at 68. I’m listening to your heart now… it sounds a bit muffled, but no immediate concerns. Your lungs sound clear. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I’m following it… I think. Is this hard? My neck gets a little stiff, sometimes. It's… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Schwer, it’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with these tests. You're doing fine. I noticed a slight tremor in your hands, and your balance seems a little unsteady. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. It will give us a better understanding of what's going on internally – things like your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and complete blood count. We can also check for any signs of inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… yeah, okay. If you think it’s important. I don't like needles much, but… I want to know what’s going on. Just… please tell me what it means, Doctor. I don’t understand… medical words. Just… tell me in plain English, okay? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I completely understand your concerns, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll answer all your questions. I'll also send the results to your primary care doctor. It's too early to say if it's serious. The blood work will help us rule out some possibilities and get a clearer picture of your overall health. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, likely in a few days. In the meantime, I want to recommend that you try to get a little more physical activity, if you're able. Even just a short walk each day can be beneficial. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never have. Just… a little arthritis sometimes. I take some… cream for that, but that's it. No pills. Just the cream. And… a lot of worrying, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. Just the cream for arthritis. I understand about the worrying, Mr. Schwer, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're not sure what's going on with your health. We’ll get to the bottom of this. To help me understand your history a little better, could you tell me about your family’s medical background?
PATIENT: Well… like I said, my mother… she had trouble with her thinking. They said… dementia, I think. It got really bad at the end. And her sister, my aunt… she had a weak heart. She was tired all the time. She passed away a long time ago. My father… he was healthy, as far as I know. He worked hard all his life. I don’t know much about my grandparents… they passed away when I was young. Mostly just… heart trouble, I think. On both sides of the family. That’s why I’m worried, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. A family history of dementia and heart trouble is certainly something we need to consider. Thank you for sharing that information. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I live alone now… my wife passed away a few years ago. I mostly just… stay home. Read the newspaper. Watch TV. I try to eat healthy, like I said. I don't drink much. Maybe a beer now and then. I used to work hard, building houses. But I’m retired now. I don’t do much… physical labor anymore. Just… relaxing, mostly. It's quiet. Too quiet sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you've had a full life, and adjusting to retirement and the loss of your wife must be challenging. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial physical exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including potential vitamin deficiencies, early stages of cognitive decline, and possible heart issues. The blood work will help us narrow down these possibilities. I want to schedule a follow-up appointment for when the blood work results are available, probably in about a week. We can discuss the results, and I can explain what they mean. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A week… yeah, that’s fine. I guess. A week. I just… I hope it's nothing serious, Doctor. I really do. Just… tell me what it is. In plain English, okay? And… don’t worry. I’ll try to stay calm.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and we'll take things one step at a time. I’ll also schedule a longer appointment then so we have enough time to discuss everything thoroughly. I'm going to write down a few notes to summarize our conversation. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything pretty well. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It helps just to… talk about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad you felt comfortable sharing your concerns with me. Remember, I’m here to help in any way I can. We’ll see you next week. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. And please, if anything changes or you feel worse, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
