DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, hi. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so just… my breath smells bad, okay? It’s embarrassing. I figured you’d… know what people come in here for.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bad breath can definitely be bothersome, and you’re right, it’s a pretty common concern. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you mean? It smells bad! Like… awful. I try to brush, obviously. I don’t want to smell like garbage, do I? It's just... persistent. Is that good enough detail for you? I really don't have time to list every single thing I eat.
DOCTOR: You're right, "smells bad" is a good start! No need to list everything you eat. Persistent is helpful information, too. Let’s try to narrow it down a bit. Does it seem to be worse at certain times of the day, like in the morning, or after meals?
PATIENT: Morning, yeah, obviously. Everyone's breath is bad in the morning. But it’s… still bad after I brush, and even during the day sometimes. Like, if I talk to someone close up. It's awful. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it persists even with brushing, and happens during the day as well. That’s good to know. It shouldn't take long, I promise. We'll just ask a few more questions and then I'll take a quick look in your mouth. Have you noticed any changes in your gums – like redness, swelling, or bleeding when you brush?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No. I mean, sometimes a little, but who doesn't get a little blood when they brush too hard? It's not a thing. I don't have some horrible gum disease or whatever. I just… want this fixed. Quickly. Is there a spray or something I can just buy?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bleeding with brushing isn't necessarily a sign of anything serious, but it’s good you mentioned it. And yes, there are sprays and mouthwashes that can temporarily help with bad breath, but we want to try to figure out what's causing it so we can address the root of the problem. Just to get a better picture, have you had any recent dental work?
PATIENT: Dental work? Um… not really. I had a filling, I guess, like, two years ago? But it didn't bother me then, and it’s not bothering me now. Look, I really don't go to the dentist much. It's expensive and honestly, I don’t trust them. Is this going to involve sending me to the dentist? Because if it is… I might just leave.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pressure at all about the dentist. We can definitely explore other options first. A filling two years ago is good to know. Let's talk about your overall health for a moment. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well? Fine, I guess. I work. I sleep. I eat. You know, normal stuff. I’m a highway maintenance worker, so I'm outside a lot. Does that matter? Look, I'm not sick or anything. I just want my breath to smell normal, not like… whatever it smells like now. Is this going to take much longer? I swear, my boss is going to kill me if I'm gone much longer.
DOCTOR: Being a highway maintenance worker does matter, actually. Being outdoors and potentially exposed to different things can sometimes contribute to bad breath. Okay, so no other symptoms, feeling generally well… Have you noticed any issues with postnasal drip or frequent colds?
PATIENT: Postnasal… what now? Look, I get a little sniffly sometimes, like anyone does when the weather changes. It’s not a big deal. I don’t sit around all day blowing my nose, if that’s what you’re asking. This is ridiculous. You're asking me about my nose now? Just give me something to fix the smell! I don’t have time for a medical history. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. We’re just trying to rule out different possibilities. It's helpful to get the full picture. Since you're not experiencing any other symptoms, and it’s not related to colds, let’s do a quick exam of your mouth and throat. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. Don't poke around too much, okay? I don't like people messing with my mouth. Just look and tell me what I need to buy. A spray, a mouthwash, whatever. I have to go back to work soon. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please open wide and say "ah." Alright. Your gums are slightly red, but no major swelling or signs of infection. Your tongue looks normal, and the back of your throat is clear. I don’t see any obvious cause for the bad breath based on a visual exam. It's possible it's related to your occupation, and perhaps something you're exposed to while working. We can try a few things.
PATIENT: So? What "things"? Do I need antibiotics? Because I really don't want to take a bunch of pills. And honestly, if it’s just from my job, what am I supposed to do, quit? Look, just tell me what I need to buy, okay? I need something fast. This is getting ridiculous. Honestly.
DOCTOR: No, no antibiotics are needed at this time. And definitely don’t quit your job! What I recommend is focusing on good oral hygiene. That means brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from the surface of your tongue. Also, stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water. I'm going to recommend a therapeutic mouthwash containing chlorhexidine. It’s an antibacterial mouthwash that can help reduce the bacteria that cause bad breath. You can get it at most pharmacies. Use it twice a day for one week. If the problem persists after a week, we can consider a referral to a dentist to rule out any underlying dental issues, or discuss other potential causes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. A mouthwash. Just a mouthwash. Okay. And if it doesn’t work? Look, I really don't want to go to the dentist. Honestly. I'm going to try the mouthwash, and if it doesn’t work, I guess… I guess I'll just deal with it. Is that it? Can I go now? I have to get back to work. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a plan. If the mouthwash doesn't improve things after a week, give us a call and we can discuss other options. We’ll document everything in your chart. Here’s a work excuse note saying you were seen for a medical issue and need to be excused from work briefly. I hope this helps, Zelina. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Get back to work safely.
