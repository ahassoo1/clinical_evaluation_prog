DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor! It's nice to meet you too. Well... my chest. It's been hurting. Not all the time, you understand. But it's a... a squeezing, kinda. Like someone is sitting on it, but not really sitting. It's hard to explain. It started... maybe three days ago? I think it was Tuesday. Yes, Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Tuesday. A squeezing sensation in your chest, you said. And it's not constant. Can you describe where in your chest you feel this squeezing?
PATIENT: Right... in the middle. Like... here. Not on the side, not my back. Right in the front, kinda heavy. Sometimes it feels like it goes up a little, toward my throat. But mostly right here. It's not a sharp pain, you understand? Just... uncomfortable. And heavy. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: I see. So, centrally located, a heavy, squeezing discomfort. Does anything seem to bring on this discomfort, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, when I walk up the stairs... that makes it worse. Even just a few steps! And... sometimes when I’m doing dishes, bending over. It's funny. It's not like I’m running a marathon! Just… normal things. When I get a little excited, too. Not scared excited, just… happy excited. It feels silly to say.
DOCTOR: It is good you are noting these patterns. Walking, bending, and with excitement... Does this discomfort radiate anywhere – down your arm, to your back, or your jaw, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, no. Not my arm. Not my back. Not my jaw. It stays… right there. Just in my chest. Sometimes I get a little breathless with it, but that's all. Not a big breathlessness, you understand. Just… like I need to take a deeper breath. And it goes away when I sit down and rest. It's not lasting a long time, thankfully. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's wise to have this investigated. Now, Ms. Chelberg, let's review your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me a few years ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. I think it’s a white one. And... I had some cholesterol trouble, but the doctor said it’s okay now, with the pills, too. Nothing else, I think. Just the high blood pressure and the cholesterol. I get Medicare, so I see lots of doctors! It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Medicare is quite helpful. And you are taking medication for both the hypertension and cholesterol, that’s good. Do you recall the names of those medications, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… the blood pressure pill… I think it starts with an ‘A’? Amlodipine? Is that right? It's a small white pill. And the cholesterol one... oh dear. That one I can't remember. Something… statin? Like Atorvastatin? Or Simvastatin? They both sound alike! My husband helps me with those, mostly. He's good with the names. I’m not so good, I’m afraid. I just take them.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine and potentially a statin. We will confirm the statin with your pharmacy records. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to pills, not to food, not to anything! My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t have allergies. Never have. I can eat shellfish, I can take penicillin… everything is okay. I'm a very… simple person, in that way. Nothing bothers me. Except this chest pain, of course!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see... years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… oh, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? And when I was younger, I had my tonsils out. But that was when I was a little girl. And... oh! When I broke my arm, when I was a teenager, but that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. Nothing else, I think. Just the gallbladder, a long time ago. I don't go to the hospital much. I prefer to stay home.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal many years ago, and tonsillectomy in childhood. Now, Ms. Chelberg, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother… she had a heart problem, I think. Something with her heart rhythm. She didn’t take care of herself very well, smoked too many cigarettes. She passed away when I was still young. My father… he was healthy as a horse! Never sick a day in his life. And my brother… he has diabetes, but that’s it. Nothing too serious, really. Just him with the diabetes, and my mother with the heart problem. We don't have much family, you understand. Just a few of us.
DOCTOR: History of cardiac issues in your mother and diabetes in your brother. And finally, Ms. Chelberg, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, no, no. Never! I don’t smoke. I don't drink alcohol, except maybe a little sip of wine with Christmas dinner, but that’s it. And... definitely no drugs! I'm a very good Colombian woman. I like my coffee, though. That’s okay, right? Coffee is good for you!
DOCTOR: Coffee is fine in moderation. Now, Ms. Chelberg, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing chest discomfort with exertion, and you have a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Before we proceed, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor! That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle with my chest, okay? It's a little tender right now.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… And one more. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear. Now I will check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Slightly elevated. And now I will just gently palpate your chest to assess for any tenderness. There is some mild tenderness to palpation in the central chest, as you mentioned. Now, I'd like to check your pulses. Pulses are strong and regular. Overall, your examination is relatively unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure and tenderness to palpation warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: That’s… that’s where it hurts. Yes. It feels a little better when you aren’t pressing so hard, but it’s still… there. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I… am I having a heart attack? That's what I'm most afraid of. My mother… she always said chest pain meant a heart attack. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: It is understandable that you are concerned about a heart attack, especially given your mother’s history. However, your symptoms and the examination findings do not definitively point to a heart attack at this moment. But we must rule it out. To do so, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll also need some blood work, including cardiac enzymes, to see if there is any evidence of heart muscle damage. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out other possible causes of your chest pain. Would you be able to get those tests done today?
PATIENT: An EKG… blood work… an X-ray… That sounds… like a lot. But… yes. If it will make me feel better, if it will tell us what’s going on… then yes, I can do those tests. Where do I go? Will they be here? I don’t want to go somewhere else, if I can avoid it. And… will it hurt? Will they poke me a lot with needles? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: We can do all of those tests here in the clinic, Ms. Chelberg, so you won't have to go anywhere else. The EKG is painless, it simply involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood work will require a small needle stick, but it should be quick. The X-ray is also painless; you will simply stand in front of the machine. I will write you an order for the tests, and the nursing staff will guide you through each one. It will take a little while, but it is important to determine the cause of your chest pain. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and continuing to monitor your symptoms. If your chest pain becomes significantly worse, or if you experience shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or what to expect?
PATIENT: Okay… so they won’t poke me too much. And I stay here at the clinic, that’s good. No going somewhere else. What if it is my heart, Doctor? What if it’s something serious? I don’t want to have a big operation. My mother… she had a bad operation once. I’m scared. But… thank you for explaining everything. It makes me feel a little better, knowing what to expect. I’ll do the tests. Just… please tell me if it’s something bad. I want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: It is completely understandable to be scared, Ms. Chelberg, and you have every right to ask those questions. We will determine the cause of your chest pain, and then we can discuss the appropriate course of action. It may not be anything serious, and even if it is a heart problem, there are many treatments available. I promise to be honest with you and to explain everything in detail. We won't jump to any conclusions until we have the test results. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. The nursing staff will be in shortly to assist you. In the meantime, please try to relax and take deep breaths. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available and discuss them with you thoroughly. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for… not making me feel silly. I worry too much, I think. I will try to relax. And I’ll wait for the nurse. Thank you. I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It is my job to listen to your concerns and provide the best possible care. Please remember that I am here for you, and we will face this together. The nurse will be with you shortly. Let's hope for the best, and we will proceed with the necessary investigations.
