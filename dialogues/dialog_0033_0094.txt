DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Fontanazza, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… the lady on the phone… she said something about… learning? I don’t really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He worries too much. It’s just… stuff. I work with metal all day, you know? Loud noises. Not good for the ears, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Learning,” yes. That would be for a… baseline assessment. Part of a clinic initiative. Frankly, I find it rather… unnecessary, but protocols are protocols. You said you work with metal?
PATIENT: Metal work. Yes. Sheet metal. Lots of cutting, bending… hammering. It’s… hard work. I’ve been doing it a long time. Since… well, before I got married. Is this about my ears? They ring sometimes. But it's normal, right? Everyone I work with has ringing.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… tinnitus, medically speaking. It can be normal, as you say, especially with occupational exposure to loud noises. But it's not something to simply dismiss. Let's review your chart… minimal documented history. Do you experience any hearing loss along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing… loss? I don’t… I don’t think so. People have to yell sometimes, maybe? But they always yell at work, you know? It’s… a noisy place. My husband says I don't listen, but that's just him. He always complains. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: The point isn’t whether your husband “complains,” Ms. Fontanazza. It’s about your health. No previous audiometry on file. Alright. We’ll need to perform a basic hearing test. Just to establish a baseline, as I said. And yes, there will be a cost. We offer a sliding scale for uninsured patients, but it’s still… something. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Um… not that I know of. I don't really take pills. Maybe… a little something for headaches sometimes? But just the cheap ones. The kind you buy at the… the store. Not a doctor's medicine. I don't like going to doctors. Too much poking and prodding. Is the test going to be loud? Because I really don’t want anything loud right now.
DOCTOR: "Cheap ones," right. Well, that's… less than ideal for accurate documentation. Fine. No known allergies, as far as you’re aware. And yes, the test will involve tones at varying volumes. It's unavoidable. We need to assess your hearing thresholds, Ms. Fontanazza. It's a standard procedure. Now, let’s get this over with. The audiologist is just through here. I’ll need you to complete this brief questionnaire first. It asks about your noise exposure and any other related symptoms.
PATIENT: A questionnaire? More writing? I don't like forms. My husband always fills them out for me. He’s better at that sort of thing. But… fine. What's "tinnitus" again? Is that the ringing? Because I think I remember something about that… maybe. I don't know. This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: "Tinnitus," Ms. Fontanazza, is the medical term for ringing in the ears. As you've already mentioned. Just answer the questions to the best of your ability. It will help us understand the extent of the problem, if there is a problem. We can’t proceed without this information. And frankly, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Other patients… always other patients. How much noise is "moderate"? Is that like… yelling? Because everyone yells at work. It's a metal shop, you know? It's… loud. Very loud. And… what does "impact noise" even mean? Is that like… dropping something? This is ridiculous. I just wanted to learn something. Not fill out a questionnaire about yelling and dropping things.
DOCTOR: “Impact noise” refers to sudden, intense bursts of sound. Dropping something heavy, for example. Or the sound of hammering. Just try to be as accurate as possible, Ms. Fontanazza. We’re attempting to gather information, not engage in a philosophical debate about the definition of yelling.
PATIENT: Philosophical debate… she thinks I'm stupid. Fine. Here. Happy now? Can I go home? I don’t like doctors. And I definitely don't like questionnaires. I just… I don't understand what's happening. My husband said this was important… but it’s just making my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the audiologist will review this and conduct the test. It’s a simple procedure. Nurse, can you take Ms. Fontanazza to room three for an audiometry?
PATIENT: Room three? More rooms… Fine. Whatever. Just… tell them I don’t like loud noises. And tell them my husband made me come. He worries too much. I just want to go home.
