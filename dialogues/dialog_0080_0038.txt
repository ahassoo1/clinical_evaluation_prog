DOCTOR: Hi Evann, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I... I believe I need to arrange some paperwork regarding future medical decisions. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should something happen. I was advised to seek an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I confess, the details are a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Evann. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms are good options, and we can definitely discuss which one – or both – are right for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're thinking about this now?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult to say precisely. There wasn’t one specific incident. It’s more a growing… awareness. I’ve been divorced for some time now, and… well, I don’t have close family nearby. It just occurred to me that if I were to become unable to communicate, there wouldn't be anyone readily available to make decisions on my behalf. It seems… prudent to have things in order. Though, honestly, I’m unsure where to begin, and what exactly is involved.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s not easy to think about these things, but you’re doing the right thing by preparing. So, an Advance Directive is a legal document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you’re unable to speak for yourself. It can cover a lot, from specific treatments you want or don't want, to who you want to make decisions for you – a healthcare proxy. A POLST form, on the other hand, is more for people with serious illnesses and focuses on current treatment preferences – things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Given what you've told me, starting with an Advance Directive seems like the best first step. Before we dive into the legalities, let’s just talk about your overall health. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: That clarifies things somewhat, thank you. An Advance Directive… that sounds more appropriate, yes. As for my health… I wouldn’t say I’ve been unwell, precisely. I maintain a… fairly active lifestyle, despite my profession. It can be quite physically demanding, etching and engraving. But I do experience occasional… fatigue. And some stiffness in my joints, particularly after long hours at the bench. It's likely just age, or the nature of the work. Nothing that necessitates a doctor’s visit, usually. More… discomfort than illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, "discomfort" is good to know. And it's smart to be proactive about things, even if it's just fatigue and stiffness. Just to get a clearer picture – how long have you been experiencing this fatigue and joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s difficult to say with precision. Perhaps… the last six to nine months? It came on gradually, not a sudden onset. At first, I attributed it to a change in the studio lighting, then to a particularly intricate commission. But it hasn't fully resolved, even after completing the project. It’s… persistent, but not debilitating. I can still work, albeit with slightly more… effort than before. I do take occasional breaks, and try to stretch regularly. I confess, I’m not very good at consistently following a routine.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to nine months of gradual onset fatigue and joint stiffness. That's helpful. Just to clarify, where specifically are you experiencing the joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Primarily in my hands and wrists, as you would expect. They bear the brunt of the work, naturally. But it also affects my elbows and, occasionally, my knees. It’s not a constant ache, more… a resistance to movement, particularly in the mornings. And after prolonged periods of detailed etching. It eases with gentle exercise, but returns fairly quickly if I overexert myself. It's a… nuisance, really. I hadn't considered it worthy of a medical consultation until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands, wrists, elbows, and sometimes knees, with morning stiffness and worsening with exertion. That paints a clearer picture. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… That’s a good question. Not… dramatic swelling, no. Perhaps a very slight fullness in my knuckles sometimes, but I attributed that to the cold weather. We had a rather damp spring, and the chill does aggravate my joints. It’s very subtle, and disappears fairly quickly. I wouldn’t describe it as noticeable swelling, per se. More… a feeling of tightness, perhaps. It's difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tightness" rather than noticeable swelling. And you mentioned a damp spring. Do you feel like the symptoms are worse during certain times of the year, or in specific weather conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… quite accurate, actually. The symptoms are definitely exacerbated by cold and damp weather. The chill seems to seep into the joints, making them stiffer and more painful. Dry weather, conversely, provides some relief. It's… a seasonal pattern, I suppose. It's something I’ve noticed over the years, but dismissed as a minor inconvenience. Until now, of course. It seemed… logical to mention it, given the current circumstances. And your line of questioning. I apologize for my lack of precision. I'm not accustomed to articulating these details.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Evann. You're doing great. It's very helpful that you've noticed the seasonal pattern. It certainly adds to the picture. Now, just to complete a basic overview, have you ever had any injuries to your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: Injuries… There was a small incident, years ago. I was… experimenting with a new engraving technique, involving a rather stubborn piece of metal. I slipped, and the tool… glanced across my left wrist. It was relatively minor, a superficial cut. I cleaned it thoroughly and bandaged it myself. It healed without complication, or so I thought. There was some lingering soreness for a few weeks, but I dismissed it as a normal consequence of the mishap. It certainly didn't seem significant enough to warrant a medical visit at the time. I'm not certain of the exact date, perhaps fifteen or twenty years ago. It’s rather difficult to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, a superficial cut to your left wrist approximately fifteen to twenty years ago. That's useful information. Now, just a few more general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… To my knowledge, no. I've never experienced any adverse reactions to medication, or any specific foods. I do have a… mild sensitivity to certain cleaning products, particularly those with strong fragrances. It manifests as a slight irritation of the skin, but nothing severe. I avoid those products whenever possible. Otherwise, I’m fortunate enough to have a relatively robust constitution. I’ve always been… careful with my diet, and conscientious about avoiding potential irritants.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a mild sensitivity to strong fragrances. And you mentioned being conscientious about your diet. Can you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. I adhere to a fairly traditional Mongolian diet, with… modifications to accommodate readily available ingredients. I consume a great deal of lean protein—mutton, primarily, though I also incorporate fish and poultry when possible. I favor barley and rice over wheat, and consume a variety of vegetables, though seasonal availability limits the selection somewhat. Dairy products—yogurt and fermented mare’s milk—feature prominently in my daily routine. I limit my intake of sugar and processed foods, and prioritize fresh ingredients whenever possible. It's… a fairly simple, but nutritious, diet. I believe in the importance of a balanced lifestyle, and prioritize wholesome, natural foods.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, Evann. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I purposefully avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in the body’s natural ability to heal itself, and prefer to address any minor ailments with rest and traditional remedies—herbal teas, primarily. I do occasionally consume vitamin D supplements during the winter months, to counteract the lack of sunlight, but that is the extent of my supplement regimen. I prioritize a holistic approach to health, and believe that a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle are far more effective than relying on pharmaceutical interventions. I am… cautious about introducing foreign substances into my system.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamin D supplements. And you mentioned herbal teas. Can you tell me which ones you typically use?
PATIENT: Certainly. I favor a variety of herbal teas, depending on my needs. Chamomile tea, for relaxation and sleep. Ginger tea, for digestion. And a traditional Mongolian blend—a combination of milk thistle, dandelion root, and a local herb I cannot readily translate—for liver support and overall detoxification. I also occasionally consume green tea, for its antioxidant properties. I cultivate many of the herbs myself, whenever possible, ensuring their quality and potency. It's… a long-standing tradition in my family—the use of herbal remedies to maintain health and well-being. I find it… grounding—the act of cultivating and preparing the teas.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: That is… difficult. My family history is somewhat fragmented, due to…circumstances. My parents passed away when I was young, and I had limited contact with extended family members. I know my mother suffered from… joint discomfort in her later years, but the specifics were never discussed in detail. My father was… a robust man, and remained relatively healthy throughout his life. I believe there was a history of…heart problems on his side of the family, but the details are vague. I am…not privy to a comprehensive medical history, unfortunately. It is…a source of some regret. It makes it… challenging to assess potential risks. I apologize for my lack of information. I wish I could provide a more detailed account.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. You’ve shared what you know, and that's what’s important. It’s understandable that family history can be incomplete. Alright. Given what you’ve told me about your fatigue, joint stiffness, seasonal pattern, and a history of joint discomfort in your mother, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I understand the necessity of a physical assessment. I… trust your judgment. I hope it won’t be too… intrusive. I am, admittedly, somewhat sensitive about being examined. But I recognize the importance of a thorough evaluation. Please let me know if you require any further information.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, respiration is 16 and unlabored, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, clear. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's focus on your joints. Can you please make a fist with both hands?
PATIENT: There is… a slight discomfort in my left hand, particularly in the knuckles. It’s more… a stiffness, than pain. It eases after a few moments, but returns when I clench my fist again. It's… a familiar sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to gently palpate your joints now, feeling for any swelling or tenderness. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the knuckles of your left hand, and a very slight fullness in the wrists bilaterally. No significant redness or warmth. Range of motion is slightly limited in both wrists, particularly with flexion and extension, but no crepitus. Your elbows and knees are normal to palpation and have a full range of motion. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Sensory function appears intact. I'm also going to look at your hands closely. No visible deformities or nodules. Skin is normal in appearance, though I do note some mild calluses on the fingertips, consistent with her profession.
PATIENT: The calluses are… expected, given the nature of my work. I spend many hours etching and engraving. It’s… unavoidable. The slight tenderness in my wrists is also… not surprising. I’ve been experiencing discomfort there for some time, as I mentioned previously. It’s… reassuring to hear that there are no visible deformities. I’ve always been… meticulous about hand care, but it’s… difficult to prevent all injuries given the precision required. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Evann. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I’m considering a few possibilities. The fatigue and joint stiffness, particularly in your hands and wrists, along with the seasonal pattern, and mild tenderness, could be consistent with early-stage osteoarthritis. However, given your age and the fatigue component, we also need to rule out other causes, such as early rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein , and a rheumatoid factor test. I'll also order X-rays of your hands and wrists to assess for any structural changes. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests and X-rays… I understand the necessity of further investigation. Osteoarthritis… I confess, I had considered that possibility, given the nature of my work. Rheumatoid arthritis… that sounds… more concerning. What exactly is an inflammatory marker? And what would these tests reveal, specifically? I… apologize for my questions. I am not well-versed in medical terminology. I simply wish to understand the rationale behind these procedures. What is the next step after the tests are done?
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. That’s exactly what I’m here for, to explain things clearly. An inflammatory marker, like C-reactive protein, is a substance that increases in the blood when there is inflammation in the body. Elevated levels can suggest an autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis, or other inflammatory processes. The blood tests will help us to rule out other conditions that could be causing your fatigue and joint stiffness, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. The X-rays will allow us to visualize the bones and joints in your hands and wrists and see if there are any signs of cartilage loss or bone damage, which are typical in osteoarthritis. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail. If the tests suggest osteoarthritis, we can focus on symptom management – things like physical therapy, pain relievers, and assistive devices. If the tests suggest rheumatoid arthritis, we’ll need to refer you to a rheumatologist for further evaluation and treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies things considerably. So, the tests are to differentiate between… different possibilities. To determine the cause of my symptoms, and guide the appropriate course of action. I… appreciate your patience in explaining these complex procedures. I confess, medical terminology is… daunting. And the prospect of further tests is… unsettling, but I understand the necessity. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I'm glad I could clarify things. Regarding the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab results to come back, and the X-rays will be reviewed by the radiologist within a similar timeframe. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss them thoroughly. Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I'll give you a lab requisition form, and the lab technician will provide you with more specific instructions. We can also schedule a brief phone call after they run the tests, just to answer any initial questions you may have, before your formal follow-up. For now, do you have any questions about the Advance Directive we discussed earlier?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I have a sufficient understanding of the Advance Directive for the time being. The blood tests… and the fasting, I shall remember. And a follow-up appointment in approximately one week. I… appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience in addressing my concerns. I believe that concludes my questions for today. Please, let me know if there is anything else I need to be aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab requisition form printed for you now, and we’ll get the follow-up appointment scheduled. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And if your symptoms worsen significantly—severe pain, fever, or difficulty with daily activities—please seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you, Evann. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. I shall certainly contact the office if any concerns arise. And I look forward to our next meeting as well. I appreciate your time and expertise. Farewell.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. Farewell to you as well. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again. Good day.
