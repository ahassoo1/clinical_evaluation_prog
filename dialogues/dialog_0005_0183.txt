DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor… it’s this tiredness. Always tired. Like… too much work, but I don’t do much work these days, you understand? My wife, she says I sleep too much. But even when I sleep, I feel… not fresh. It's been going on a long time. The liver… they told me about the liver a while back. Not good, they said.
DOCTOR: “A long time,” you say. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me think. Before the… the hot season last year, I think. Yes, before it got really, really hot. Maybe six, seven months now? Something like that. It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. Time… it goes quickly when you’re… resting. And I have been resting a lot. It’s not like I’m running around building houses or something. You understand.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months of persistent fatigue. And you mentioned something about the liver not being good… Do you recall what was said about your liver?
PATIENT: Not good… they said it was… swollen. Big. And something about… not cleaning things right. Doctor, I don’t remember all the fancy words. I just remember the doctor looking serious. And my wife, she keeps making me drink… what is it… dandelion tea? Says it helps the liver. It tastes terrible. But she worries. She always worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And did they do any tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Yes, they took… blood. Lots of blood. And they… poked my side with something. Not a nice poke, I tell you. But they didn’t say what they found, exactly. Just that I needed to… watch what I eat. And not drink too much. I don’t drink much, Doctor. Just a little beer sometimes with dinner. It helps me sleep, you know. Though it doesn't seem to be helping much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some blood work from January. It does show some abnormalities in your liver function tests. Elevated AST and ALT… and your bilirubin is slightly high. Hmm. And you mentioned a poke… was that a scan, perhaps?
PATIENT: Scan? Maybe. It was a big machine. I had to lie down. They rubbed something cold on my stomach. It wasn’t comfortable. They took pictures, I think. A lot of beeping. They said… something about seeing the size of it. The liver. Said it was bigger than it should be. Looked… not right. I don’t understand all these doctor words. It’s just… tiring, all this worrying. And being so tired. You understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it’s frustrating. It sounds like you had an ultrasound of your liver. The results here confirm they noted some enlargement. Have you seen any other symptoms besides the fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think. My stomach… it sometimes feels full, even when I haven't eaten much. And… sometimes it’s a little yellow, my skin. Not all over, just… my eyes, maybe. My wife says so. I don’t look at myself much. And… sometimes, when I go to the bathroom… it’s… not the normal color. Lighter. Like… the color of sand. Is that important, Doctor? It’s all very… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That is important, Mr. Grumman. Fullness, jaundice – the yellowing of the skin and eyes – and pale stools... those are all concerning symptoms. We need to investigate this further. Have you experienced any itching?
PATIENT: Itching? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes, at night, my skin feels… prickly. Not all over, just my arms, mostly. I thought it was the mosquito bites. We have a lot of mosquitos here. But it's not really bites, is it? It just… feels itchy. I scratch it, but it doesn't really help. My wife says I scratch too much in my sleep. She tries to stop me. It’s… annoying, Doctor. Everything is just… annoying. And I'm tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. It sounds like we’re dealing with a potentially serious liver problem. We need to run some more tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I want to repeat the blood work, and I’d like to order an abdominal CT scan to get a more detailed look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: CT scan… more poking and beeping? Will it tell me what’s wrong? My wife… she wants to know if it’s serious. Will I need… a hospital? I don’t like hospitals, Doctor. They smell bad. And… I don’t want any more tests if it’s just going to tell me bad news. What kind of bad news? You understand, Doctor. I just want to feel better. The tiredness… it’s ruining everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your concerns, but avoiding tests won’t make the problem go away. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of the situation. It's possible it's something relatively minor, but we need to rule out more serious conditions. As for “bad news,” it could be something like cirrhosis or even a blockage. And yes, depending on what we find, you may need to be admitted to the hospital. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll take it one step at a time. I'll order the scan and we'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not really. I get bitten by mosquitos, but that's not an allergy, is it? I don’t like shellfish, but that’s just because it tastes funny. And… I think once, a long time ago, I had a rash when I used a new soap. But it went away. My wife says I'm not allergic to anything. She knows everything, Doctor. She really does. But… this tiredness… it’s new. It’s different. Is it the liver, for sure? Because I don't want to spend all this time and money on tests if it’s just… old age. You understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it’s possible the fatigue is unrelated, but given your history and the symptoms you’ve described – the jaundice, the pale stools, the itching – your liver is the most likely culprit. We need to investigate further to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. I will order the CT scan and some additional bloodwork. In the meantime, it is crucial you abstain from alcohol completely. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No alcohol… even a little beer with dinner? But it helps me sleep, Doctor! My wife will be happy, I suppose. She always says I drink too much. But… what if the scan is bad? What then? Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have… appointments. And my wife, she’s expecting me to help with the garden. You understand. I just want to know… how much longer will this all take?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, look, the small amount of beer you're having is likely exacerbating the problem, and it's best to eliminate it completely until we know what we're dealing with. As for the scan, it's a non-invasive procedure – you'll simply lie on a table and a machine will take pictures. It shouldn't hurt, though you may feel slightly warm. The results should be available within a few days, but it depends on the radiologist's workload. I understand you have appointments and commitments, but your health is the priority. I'll have my nurse schedule you for the scan as soon as possible. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Rest… My wife will be pleased. But I do need to know… if it’s serious… will I need to see… a specialist? A different doctor? I don’t like new doctors. And… what if it’s… something I can’t fix? You understand, Doctor. I just want to know… what am I looking at? And how much will all of this cost? My Medicare… will it cover everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, you're jumping ahead. We haven't even done the scan yet. It's possible you won't need to see a specialist. However, if the results indicate a more complex problem, I may refer you to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the scan and any necessary follow-up appointments. However, there may be co-pays and deductibles. My nurse can provide you with more information about your specific coverage. Look, let's focus on getting the scan done first. Worrying about hypotheticals isn’t going to help. I'll order the scan and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any immediate questions regarding the scan itself, or can we proceed with scheduling it?
PATIENT: Scheduling… yes, I suppose. But… what do I need to do for the scan? Do I need to… drink anything beforehand? Or eat something special? I don't want to mess it up. And… will they need to… poke me again? You understand, Doctor. I just want it to be over with. And… hopefully not too bad.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, you won’t need to do anything special to prepare for the scan. You can eat and drink as normal. And no, you won’t need to be “poked” again. It’s a completely non-invasive procedure. You’ll simply lie on a table and the machine will take images. My nurse will give you detailed instructions before your appointment, but essentially, you just need to show up on time. Is there anything else you’re concerned about right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get it over with. And… hopefully not too bad. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Goodbye, Mr. Grumman.
