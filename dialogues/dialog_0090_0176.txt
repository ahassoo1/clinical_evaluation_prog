DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's these hiccups. They just won't stop. Been going on for… well, over two days now, I think. It’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Two days, alright. That is a bit persistent. And are they constant hiccups, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. There are little breaks, maybe ten or fifteen minutes where I don't have them, then they start right up again. It's… disruptive, you know? Especially at work. I manage the shows at the theater, and it’s hard to talk to the performers when I'm… hic …like this.
DOCTOR: A theater manager, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The Grand Majestic. We have a new production starting next week, and I’m trying to get everything organized. It’s a lot of running around, a lot of talking… which is difficult when you hic keep interrupting yourself! It's a musical, so timing is everything.
DOCTOR: Well, constant interruption is…unideal, to say the least. Have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, have I! Everything people told me, really. Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me… even a spoonful of sugar. Nothing seems to work for very long. Maybe five minutes, then hic they’re back. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific seemed to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so. It started on Saturday, after work. I was just relaxing at home, watching a movie. I had a glass of iced tea, but I drink iced tea all the time. hic Nothing different about it, as far as I can recall. I did have a bit of a stressful week getting ready for auditions, but that was before the hiccups started.
DOCTOR: Stressful week… alright. Now, aside from the hiccups, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chest pain. Not feeling dizzy or anything like that. My stomach feels a little… unsettled sometimes, but I'm always a bit sensitive, so I don't know if that’s related. And I haven’t been able to sleep properly, because hic they wake me up. But I think that’s just from the annoyance of it all, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had pneumonia when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s usually controlled with diet. I don’t take any regular medication for it, just try to eat healthy. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. hic
DOCTOR: "Pretty healthy," you say. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems, but those were both later in life. Nothing really… inherited, as far as I know. My sister is perfectly fine, and my brother just has the usual aches and pains of getting older. hic It’s a long family, so it's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. No reactions to food, medications, anything like that. I live in the city, so I’m exposed to… everything, really. hic Pollen, dust, cats… I haven’t noticed anything bothering me specifically.
DOCTOR: And smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. I used to work with performers who smoked, and I hated it. Absolutely dreadful habit. Always complained about the smell. hic
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs and take a look at your throat, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on. It’s just… hic… so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Lungs sound clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Throat looks a little red, but nothing significant. No obvious signs of infection. Hmm. Normal heart sounds as well.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? hic I'm starting to get worried now.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Redeye, honestly, it doesn’t sound like anything serious at this point. It's likely just a case of… persistent hiccups. Sometimes these things just happen, especially with a bit of stress. But we can run some blood work just to rule out anything else, if you'd like. A CBC, a basic metabolic panel… just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh. So there’s no… you know, something wrong with my heart or lungs? That's… good. The blood work sounds sensible, yes, please. Just to be on the safe side. hic I appreciate you checking everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order those tests now. In the meantime, I suggest you try some relaxation techniques. Deep breathing, meditation… anything to reduce your stress levels. And avoid carbonated beverages. They can sometimes make hiccups worse. It’s probably just a minor irritation that will resolve on its own. Don’t worry too much. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and we’ll go from there.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Relaxation techniques... I'll try that. It's just hard when you're running around trying to manage a theater! hic But I will. Thank you, Doctor. And how will I get the results? Will someone call me?
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you directly with the results, Ms. Redeye. It usually takes 2-3 business days. And frankly, given your history, I doubt we'll find anything of concern, so don't spend too much time worrying about it. If they persist beyond a week, then we can revisit this. But for now, I recommend you focus on rest and relaxation. Anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time, Doctor Kur. And for listening to me complain about my hic hiccups. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Redeye. And try not to let the hiccups interrupt too much of your show. It sounds like a stressful job, and frankly, I have other patients to see.
