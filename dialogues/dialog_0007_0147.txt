DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been bothering me a bit. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand wanting to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It feels fairly firm, not squishy, and it’s probably about the size of a plum, maybe a little smaller. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it's definitely still there. It doesn't hurt constantly, but if I strain myself—lifting something, even coughing sometimes—it feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. A plum-sized, firm lump that’s been there a few weeks, and discomfort with straining. Okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is it located?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's… sort of in the middle, a bit to the left of my belly button, you know? Not right in the center, but not on the side either. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, but that's the general area. I can show you, if that would help?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Showing me is always helpful.
PATIENT: Here. It’s right about here. See? It feels… distinct from the rest of my stomach. It’s not soft like the surrounding area.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Thanks for showing me. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… No, not really. Everything seems fairly normal in that regard. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that. Same as usual, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. No fever, no feeling sick to my stomach, and my weight has been pretty stable. I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. I actually think I might have gained a little recently, but that’s probably just the summer heat!
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no nausea, stable weight. That’s all helpful information. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a long time ago. Other than that, nothing major. I get the occasional headache, like everyone does, and my wife says I snore, but nothing that requires a doctor’s attention, really. No serious illnesses or anything. Do you need to know about any allergies?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve eaten pretty much everything without any problems, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications. I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. I’m not on any prescription drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies, just a daily multivitamin. Now, let’s talk about family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have had any history of abdominal problems, like colon cancer, hernias, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That's a bit difficult to recall completely. My mother had some stomach issues when she was older, but I don't remember the specifics. It wasn't anything like cancer, as far as I know. My father was healthy as a horse, and my siblings are all doing well too. No hernias that I'm aware of, or any major abdominal surgeries in the family. We weren’t really a family that talked much about medical histories, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's understandable. Alright, Amy, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen and gently feel around to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling some mild tenderness when I press here, and the lump is firm and doesn't move much. It's about two centimeters in size, and it feels well-defined. No rebound tenderness, which is good. I don't feel any guarding either. Based on the exam, the lump is concerning enough that I'd like to order some imaging to get a clearer picture of what we're dealing with. I'm thinking a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be the best first step. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your assessment. It’s a little worrying to hear you say it’s concerning, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. What exactly will the scan show? And… what are we looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and it's good you're asking questions. A CT scan will give us detailed images of the organs and tissues in your abdomen and pelvis. It can help us determine the size, shape, and location of the lump, and whether it’s solid or fluid-filled. We’ll be looking to see if it's a cyst, a lipoma , a hernia, or something else. It’s also important to rule out anything more serious, like a tumor or a growth on one of your organs. I'm not trying to scare you, Amy, but it’s better to have a clear picture of what’s going on so we can determine the best course of action. The scan itself is painless, and it usually takes about 30 minutes. You'll need to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help visualize the tissues better. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the dye in more detail if you'd like. I'll also give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the scan. Would you like me to go ahead and order the scan for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. If you think it’s the best course of action, then let’s go ahead and order the scan. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It definitely makes me feel more at ease. And yes, please do tell me more about the contrast dye—what are the potential risks, and what should I expect?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll get the order sent to the radiology department now. The contrast dye is an iodine-based liquid that helps us see the tissues more clearly on the scan. Most people tolerate it well, but there are a few potential risks. The most common side effects are a metallic taste in your mouth and a warm sensation when you urinate. In rare cases, people can have an allergic reaction to the dye, ranging from mild itching and hives to a more serious reaction. That’s why we’ll ask you about any allergies you have before the scan, and we’ll have emergency medication available just in case. We’ll also ask about your kidney function, as the dye is processed by the kidneys. If you have any pre-existing kidney problems, we may need to take some extra precautions. Do you have a history of kidney disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any history of kidney problems. My wife always tells me I drink too much water, if anything! I haven’t ever been told anything about my kidneys being unhealthy. When will I be able to schedule the scan? And… how long until I get the results back?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, I'm sending the order to radiology now. They'll call you within 24-48 hours to schedule the scan. The fastest appointment is usually within a week, but it depends on their availability. As for the results, the radiologist will review the images and send a report to me, usually within 24-48 hours after the scan. I'll then review the report and contact you to discuss the findings and next steps. It typically takes about a week to get everything finalized. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, Amy?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll keep an eye out for the call from radiology, and I’ll contact the clinic if anything changes. I suppose there's nothing left to do but wait, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much until we have the results. .
