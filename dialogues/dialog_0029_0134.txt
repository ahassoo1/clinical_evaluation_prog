DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it’s been a bit of a bother, this feeling. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I haven't eaten much. And I just… don't feel hungry, you know? It's hard to explain. It's been going on for a little while now, but it seems worse lately. I apologize if I'm not making much sense. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kelder, take your time. It sounds frustrating. So, you’ve been experiencing nausea and a loss of appetite, and it’s been increasing recently. Can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Roughly… that's a good question. I'd say… maybe a couple of months? It started off just feeling a little off after eating, then it got to be feeling off before eating, and now… well, now it's just most of the time. I really can't say for sure, though. Time just seems to slip away these days. I do remember my daughter, Sarah, noticing I wasn’t finishing my plate at her barbecue… that was… July, I think? So, at least a month, maybe longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, at least a month, potentially longer, with it gradually worsening. And you mentioned it started with feeling unwell after eating, then progressed to before eating, and now it's pretty constant. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, I do get tired easily, much more than usual. And sometimes my stomach feels… full, even when I’ve only had a few bites of food. It’s a strange feeling. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and bloated. Oh, and I’ve been losing a little weight, I suppose. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't really been keeping track. Is that important? I worry I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder, this is all very helpful. So, fatigue, a feeling of fullness with little food, and some unintentional weight loss. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Changes in… well, in that area? Yes, actually. It’s been… irregular. Sometimes I have trouble going, and sometimes… well, sometimes it’s the opposite. It's hard to explain. It just doesn't feel normal. It’s been happening off and on, along with the other things. I haven't told anyone about it before, I just figured it was old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in bowel habits are important to note. And it’s good you’re telling me, Ms. Kelder. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color?
PATIENT: Blood… no, I don’t think so. I haven't seen any bright red, anyway. The color… sometimes it’s a little darker than usual, maybe. But I haven't paid much attention, to be honest. It’s just… everything feels off, and I haven’t been examining things closely, if you understand what I mean. I apologize, Doctor. I'm not much help with details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You're doing just fine. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any pain anywhere – stomach pain, abdominal pain, or anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes my stomach feels a bit uncomfortable, like a dull ache, but it’s not really painful. It comes and goes, and it’s not severe. Just… a nagging feeling. Other than that, no, not really. My joints ache a bit sometimes, but that's just old age, I figure. I used to be a very active animal trainer, you see, and all that work takes a toll on your body over the years. But not a sharp pain, no. Certainly nothing sudden or alarming.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, intermittent ache in the stomach, but no sharp or sudden pain. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a good question. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, probably… forty years ago now? And I have a bit of arthritis, like I mentioned. And… oh, yes. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. It was… breast cancer, I think. I had treatment, and they said it was under control, but… it's all a bit fuzzy. I don't remember all the details. My daughter, Sarah, handles most of my medical things now. She’s very good at keeping track of everything. I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. It's helpful to know about the gallbladder removal, arthritis, and the history of breast cancer. Do you remember what type of treatment you received for the cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… I vaguely recall… chemotherapy, yes. And radiation, I believe. It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t a pleasant experience. I mostly remember feeling very tired and sick. I had to go to the hospital a lot. Sarah explained everything to me at the time, but it’s all a bit of a blur now. I think they said it was successful, but… well, things have been feeling off lately, and that's why I'm here, isn't it? I'm afraid my memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chemotherapy and radiation. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a few. I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill… and something for my blood pressure, I think. It’s a pink one. And… oh, yes. Sarah makes sure I get my vitamins every day. She’s very conscientious. I really couldn’t manage all of this on my own. I’m afraid I don’t know the names of any of them, though. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll get a list of your medications from Sarah. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… Let me think. No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to be stung by a bee once when I was a little girl, but that didn't bother me much. Just a little swelling, that's all. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I apologize, Doctor, for being so vague. I wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Kelder. We can sort through all of this. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just hope it’s nothing serious. This feeling is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. Your heart and lungs sound okay, although your heart rate is a little fast. Your abdomen is tender to the touch in the upper right area. Your bowel sounds are a bit quiet. I'm also noting you appear slightly dehydrated. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also want to order a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. Would you be able to collect a stool sample and bring it in next week?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Sarah can probably help me with that, too. She's very good at all these things. Blood work and a… stool sample? Oh my. It’s not very pleasant, is it? But if it will help, then yes, I’ll do it. What exactly are we looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m a bit worried, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Kelder. It’s important you understand what's going on. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check your organ function, and see if there are any signs of infection. The stool sample will help us rule out any problems with your digestive system, like bleeding or infection. We're not necessarily looking for something serious, but it’s important to rule out anything concerning given your symptoms and history. The nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits, combined with your past cancer treatment, warrant further investigation. The tenderness in your abdomen could indicate a number of things, and the blood work and stool sample will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. The stool sample can be collected at home and brought in next week. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. Sarah will be relieved to hear we're getting some answers. Let’s just get the blood work done, and I’ll try to collect the sample next week. Thank you again. I trust you’ll let me know as soon as you have the results?
