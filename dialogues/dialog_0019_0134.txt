DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Land sakes, where do I even begin? It’s…well, I’ve been feeling awful queasy lately. Not all the time, but often enough to be a bother. And I don’t get hungry like I used to. A little bit of food and I feel full…too full, almost. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Raymonde. That’s perfectly alright. Many things can cause queasiness and loss of appetite. We'll figure it out. "A little while now…" can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s…hard to say exactly. Seems like maybe a month or so? Perhaps a bit longer. It started gradually, you see. Not a sudden thing. I just…stopped enjoying my meals as much. And then the feeling sick started happening more and more. It's just…uncomfortable. I used to love to cook for my grandkids, but now…it doesn't appeal to me much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, especially when it impacts things you enjoy. So, about a month or so, gradually worsening… and it’s affecting your appetite and making you feel unwell. Do you experience any vomiting with this queasiness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no vomiting. Just…that unsettled feeling, you know? Like something’s not quite right in my stomach. And sometimes a little bit of heartburn. It’s not terrible heartburn, just…a warm, uncomfortable feeling. It happens mostly after I eat, even if it's just a small plate. Do you need me to tell you what kind of food I’ve been eating?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily right now, Raymonde. Though, we may get to that later. For now, let’s focus on the other symptoms. You mentioned heartburn... is it a burning sensation, and where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s a warm burning feeling. It starts right here, in my chest, sort of behind my breastbone. And sometimes it creeps up into my throat. Not every time, mind you, but when it happens it’s…unpleasant. I used to take something for it years ago, but I can’t rightly recall what it was called. My daughter used to handle my medications, so I don't keep track very well anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Raymonde, don’t worry about remembering the name. We’ll figure it out. Okay, so heartburn in the chest, sometimes creeping up into the throat… Now, besides the queasiness and heartburn, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just…weary, you know? Not like I have the energy to do much gardening, and I love my garden. And…oh dear, this is silly. I've lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. But I haven't been weighing myself regularly. It's probably nothing, really. I just haven't been myself lately.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Raymonde. Weight loss and fatigue are definitely things we need to explore. And it's good you mentioned them. Now, about the weight loss… roughly, would you say a few pounds, or more significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. I reckon maybe…five or ten pounds? It's been gradual, so I didn't really notice it right away. My daughter commented on it last time she visited, said I looked a bit thinner. She worries about me, bless her heart. But I've always been a healthy eater, so I didn't think much of it at first. I’m just…not myself, like I said. Everything feels a little off.
DOCTOR: Okay, five to ten pounds, noticed by your daughter… That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes, where to begin? Well, years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was a long time ago, though. And…oh dear. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. Breast cancer, it was. I had treatment, and they said it was…well, they said it was under control. I see an oncologist regularly for check-ups. But that was…awhile ago. I don't like to dwell on it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. You don't need to dwell on anything you're not comfortable with. It's important information for me to know, though, and I appreciate you sharing it. So, gallbladder removal and a history of breast cancer, currently under control with regular oncology visits. That’s good to hear. Do you recall when your last oncology appointment was?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… oh dear, my memory. I believe it was in March. Yes, March of this year. Dr. Albright is my oncologist. She's a very nice woman. She did some scans then, and everything looked…stable, she said. But I've been feeling these new symptoms since then, and that’s why I came to see you. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, March visit with Dr. Albright, scans were stable… We'll investigate these new symptoms, Raymonde. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Just a little pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains, ibuprofen. But not very often. And that's about it, I believe. I used to take more medications, but Dr. Albright simplified things a few years back. I'm not very good at keeping track of all of this, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. We’ll get everything sorted out. So, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed… Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, although I try to avoid too much sugar these days. My daughter says it's bad for my blood pressure. She worries about me a lot. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Raymonde, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old woman, you know, things don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. Okay, your heart sounds good. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender up here. Does that bother you?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that's a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but…yes, right there. It's been feeling a bit sore lately, actually. Just a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp or anything. I thought it was just indigestion, to be honest. But yes, that definitely feels tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the epigastric region… Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Raymonde, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about a few things. Given your history of breast cancer, and the weight loss and tenderness in your abdomen, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to check your overall health. And I’m also going to order an upper endoscopy to take a closer look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…serious. An endoscopy? Is that…painful? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I understand you need to check things, but…I'm a bit nervous, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it…the cancer?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Raymonde. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when we're talking about these things. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to look for any abnormalities. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of your digestive tract. We will give you medication to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure, and you won't feel any pain. We’re not necessarily looking for cancer right away. The tenderness in your abdomen, combined with your weight loss, could be caused by a number of things – an ulcer, gastritis, even a hiatal hernia. The endoscopy will help us determine the exact cause. Given your history of breast cancer, we just want to be thorough and rule everything out. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I just…I don't like surprises. And I get scared easily these days. What exactly will happen? Will I be awake? And how long does it take? And what if you do find something…serious? I know you said you want to be thorough, but…it's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. Before the endoscopy, you'll meet with the anesthesiologist who will discuss the sedation options with you. Most patients choose to be moderately sedated, meaning you’ll be awake but very relaxed and likely won’t remember much of the procedure. Some patients opt for deeper sedation, where they're essentially asleep. During the procedure, you’ll lie on your side, and we’ll gently insert the endoscope through your mouth. It doesn’t usually cause any discomfort, but you might feel a slight pressure. The entire procedure typically takes about 15-30 minutes. If we do find something, like an ulcer or inflammation, we can often treat it during the procedure with medication or take a biopsy for further analysis. If we find something more serious, we'll discuss the results with you and develop a treatment plan together. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer all of your questions every step of the way. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound a little better. Knowing what to expect helps a lot. And knowing you'll be there to explain things…that's reassuring. So, I'll meet with the anesthesiologist first, and they'll talk to me about the sedation? And then…you'll do the procedure? What about after the procedure? Will I be able to eat right away? And will I be okay to drive home? I live alone, you see, so I need to be able to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You’ll meet with the anesthesiologist to discuss the best sedation option for you. They'll explain the risks and benefits of each option and answer any questions you have. Then, I’ll perform the endoscopy. After the procedure, you’ll be monitored in the recovery area for about an hour or so. You might feel a little groggy from the sedation, and your throat might be a bit sore. You can usually eat something light after a couple of hours, but we recommend starting with clear liquids. Because of the sedation, you won’t be able to drive home yourself. You'll need to have someone drive you, or take a taxi or ride-sharing service. We’ll make sure you're fully recovered before you leave. I’ll also give you detailed instructions on what to expect after the procedure and who to contact if you have any concerns. Would you like me to schedule the appointment for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I feel a little less scared now, knowing what to expect. When do you have an opening? And…who should I call if I have questions before the appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help. Let's see... I have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM sounds perfect. Thank you. And…who should I call with questions?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here's a paper with all the details of your appointment, including the contact information for the endoscopy center and my office. If you have any questions before Tuesday, please don’t hesitate to call. The number is on the paper. My nurse, Susan, is very helpful and can answer most questions, or she can get me to call you back. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You've been so kind and thorough, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better prepared now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. I’ll see you on Tuesday. Take care. .
