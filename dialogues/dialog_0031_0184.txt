DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Rakosky, eh? Well, don't expect me to remember all these fancy names. Look, I ain’t got all day. I come 'cause… well, I look in the mirror, and I don’t like what I see. Simple as that. Everything’s… droopin’. Not what it used to be, you understand? And it’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It's perfectly alright if remembering names is difficult, and I appreciate your directness. It sounds like you’re concerned about some physical changes you’ve noticed. Could you tell me a bit more about what you mean by “drooping”?
PATIENT: Droopin’! You askin’ me to explain droopin’? Honestly. It’s… the skin, all over, really. Face, neck… even my arms. It used to be firm, tight. Now it’s… loose. Like an old rubber band. And the belly… don’t even get me started on the belly. Used to be flat as a board, now it's… well, you get the picture. I’m a pile driver operator, you know. I build things! I don’t look like this.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Trendler. I didn’t mean to be insensitive; I was simply trying to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It sounds like you’ve noticed a general loss of skin elasticity and some changes in the appearance of your abdomen. To help me understand this better, have you noticed any other changes along with this – perhaps any weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Look, I eat what I want when I want. Always have. I ain’t one for fussin’ with diets. Maybe I put on a few pounds here and there, but nothin’ drastic. I’m a strong man. Always been strong. Weight ain't the problem. It’s the shape of things. The saggin’. It’s… undignified, you know? A man should look… solid. Not like a melted candle.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. You’re concerned about the changes in your body’s appearance and how that makes you feel. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, to help me rule out any underlying medical conditions, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmph. I’ve been banged up a bit, workin’ the pile driver, naturally. Broken a few ribs over the years, sprained an ankle or two. Had the flu a couple of times. But nothin' serious. No heart trouble, no sugar sickness, nothin' like that. I take a little somethin' for my joints, gets creaky in the cold. That’s about it. I'm a tough man, remember? Don’t break easily.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. It's good to know you generally have been healthy. You mentioned something for your joints - could you tell me the name of that medication, and how much you take?
PATIENT: Ugh, names again. Let me see... it's a little white pill. Small one. My wife, God rest her soul, used to handle all that. She kept a chart. Now she remembered things. I just take 'em every mornin'. Two of 'em, I think. Doc prescribed 'em a few years back when my knees started complainin'. Something for the arthritis, I believe. Can't recall the name. It starts with a 'G', maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It can be difficult to keep track of medications. "Starts with a 'G'..." Alright, we’ll try to look that up in your records. Before we do that, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the injuries you mentioned – the broken ribs and sprained ankles?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Surgeries? Nope. I don't believe in lettin' folks cut me open unless it's a real emergency. My wife tried to get me to do somethin' about my cataracts a few years back, but I put my foot down. I can still see just fine. A little blurry sometimes, but good enough. I'm a practical man. No need fixin' what ain't broke, you understand? I've always been able to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Trendler. You prefer to avoid medical intervention if possible. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What good will that do? My father was a strong man, worked the docks his whole life. Lived to be eighty. Mother was a homemaker, passed away when I was young. Had a sister, but haven’t seen her in years. No one had any fancy illnesses, not that I remember. Just… old age. Folks get old, they start to fall apart. It's the natural order of things. Don't see what that has to do with my droopin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Trendler, but family history can sometimes reveal predispositions to certain conditions. However, if you're not aware of any significant medical issues in your family, that's alright. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. Hard. Pile driver operator, remember? That's my lifestyle. Long hours, physical labor. I like a beer now and then with my supper. Used to smoke a pipe, but gave that up years ago. And I used to fish a bit, but haven’t had the time lately. Simple. That's my lifestyle. No fancy hobbies, no runnin' around. Just work, eat, sleep. And now… worryin' about this droopin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for sharing that. So, to recap, you’re a hardworking man, you generally eat well, you don’t smoke, and you have a history of physical labor. Now, I'm going to ask about any allergies you have to medications or anything else. Have you ever had an allergic reaction to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had any allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, not to nothin'. I can eat anything, take anything. Tough as nails, remember? My wife used to try to get me to be careful, sayin' I shouldn’t eat shellfish or somethin', but I never paid her no mind. Never had a problem. Honestly, I think these doctors make too much fuss about nothin'.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Trendler. No known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Must you? I’m a perfectly healthy man, as I’ve told you. But… I suppose if you must. Get it over with quickly, then. I haven’t got all day. Just don't poke and prod too much. I don't like bein' touched.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. There's some noticeable decreased muscle tone and the skin does appear looser than expected for your age and build. Finally, I observe skin laxity in your face and neck. Based on the exam, it appears you have significant skin laxity and decreased muscle tone, consistent with the natural aging process and potentially some loss of weight, though you haven't noted significant weight loss. Do you have any questions about what I've found so far?
PATIENT: "Natural aging process," eh? That’s what you call it? I call it lookin’ like a prune! So you’re sayin’ there’s nothin’ you can do about it? Just gonna let me keep… droopin'? Honestly, I expected a bit more from a doctor. All that listenin’ and pokin’ for nothin’. What are my options? Don’t tell me it’s just gettin’ old. I want to know if there’s somethin’ you can fix. And quickly, mind you.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. You’re right to ask about options. While some degree of skin laxity is a normal part of aging, there are several things we can consider. It’s important to remember I’m an internal medicine physician. I can assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to this. However, I am not a cosmetic surgeon. The options for addressing skin laxity typically involve cosmetic procedures such as: Radiofrequency Skin Tightening: Non-invasive procedure that uses energy to stimulate collagen production. Ultrasound Skin Tightening: Uses focused ultrasound energy to lift and tighten skin. Surgical Procedures: Such as facelifts, neck lifts, or body contouring surgeries. I would recommend a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon for a proper evaluation and to discuss which procedure, if any, would be right for you. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable surgeon in the area. Before we proceed with a referral, I’d like to order some basic blood work to ensure you are a good candidate for any potential procedures. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A plastic surgeon? Honestly! You're sendin’ me to another doctor now? All this runnin’ around! But… alright, fine. If that’s what it takes. But get me the name of a good one. Not one of those… fancy folks who just want to take my money. And blood work? More pokin’ and proddin’? Ugh. Just get it done quickly, and let me know when I can see this surgeon. I haven't got all day, you know. I got things to do. And I want to see results. Don't send me on a wild goose chase. Understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand perfectly. You want a reputable plastic surgeon and you want results. I will personally ensure I provide you with a name of a surgeon known for their excellent work and patient satisfaction. I’ll write the orders for the blood work now. It will be a standard panel, and the phlebotomist will only need a small sample. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. We can get that scheduled for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. Once the results are back, I will review them and contact you to discuss them. I will also provide you with the surgeon’s name and contact information, along with any relevant information about their practice. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Tomorrow morning. Across the street. Make sure they don’t poke me too much. And get me that surgeon’s name tonight. I want to look them up. Don’t want to waste my time with someone who… well, you understand. I expect efficiency, doctor. Efficiency. I haven’t got all day to be messin’ around.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. Efficiency is my priority. Here are your lab orders and the referral note with Dr. Eleanor Vance's information. She’s a board-certified plastic surgeon with an excellent reputation, specializing in facial and body contouring. Her office is located about 30 minutes from here. I’ve included her website address on the referral note so you can review her credentials and see examples of her work. Please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We'll get the results from the lab as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Vance, eh? I'll look her up. Alright, fine. I think that’s all. Just get it done. No need for any fuss. And I expect a call when those results are back. Don't leave me hangin’. I haven’t got all day, you understand? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand completely. My staff will contact you as soon as your lab results are available. We appreciate your patience. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best. .
