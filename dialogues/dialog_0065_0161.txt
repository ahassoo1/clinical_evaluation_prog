DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about preventing HIV. I heard about some medicine you can take, a preventative thing? I want to learn about that, if you don’t mind. I’d like to get started if it’s right for me, honestly. I don’t want to waste time, if that’s okay with you.
DOCTOR: Preventative medicine is always a good idea, Ms. Trefren, though it’s rarely so… straightforward. You're referring to PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is effective, but it's not for everyone, and there’s a process involved. Before we discuss starting anything, I need to get a comprehensive picture of your risk factors and medical history to determine if it's appropriate and safe for you. First, can you tell me a little bit about why you’re interested in PrEP at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, PrEP, right. That’s the name. Look, it’s… complicated. I’ve been… dating. And I’m not always good at asking… questions before things happen, you know? I just want to be safe. I’m single, haven’t been with anyone long-term in a while, and I want to protect myself. Honestly, it feels better to be prepared than to worry after the fact. Is that… enough of an explanation? It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but there you go.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Trefren. It's perfectly reasonable to be proactive about your health, and you are absolutely not alone in finding these conversations difficult. It's commendable that you're taking this step. Now, to ensure PrEP is the right choice, and to establish a baseline for monitoring, let's go through some standard questions. We'll start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems, liver disease, or any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high cholesterol for a bit, maybe ten years ago? But the doctor said it went down with diet and exercise. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Honestly, I mostly just deal with aches and pains from standing all day at the parking lot. Nothing a little ibuprofen can’t fix. I haven’t been to the doctor much lately, if I’m being honest. Medicare covers most things, but… I avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And just to clarify, you said you've been managing the cholesterol with diet and exercise, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The doctor checked my levels a couple of times after I changed my eating habits and started walking more, and they were normal. He said I didn’t need any medication, just to keep doing what I was doing. It’s been years, though, so maybe I should get that checked again? But honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: It would be prudent to recheck those levels, yes, as things can change over time. We can order that today. Now, regarding past surgeries – have you ever had any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was little, so they had to set it. That’s it. No major surgeries, nothing like that. I’ve been lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tough one. My family… it’s complicated. A lot of them are still in Palestine, and I haven’t seen them in years. I know my mother had… some heart problems, towards the end of her life. And my father had diabetes. But honestly, I don’t know a lot of the details. It wasn’t something we talked about much. It’s… hard to get information from that far away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Family medical history can be difficult to obtain, especially with distance. So, to be clear, you know of a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And… I think my aunt on my mother’s side had high blood pressure? But again, it’s all very vague. I’m not sure what exactly, or how severe it was. It was just… things I overheard, years ago. It’s not much to go on, I know.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have some information, even if it’s incomplete, Ms. Trefren. We can sometimes gather more details later. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother smoked when I was a kid, and it was awful. I swore I’d never touch the stuff. And I haven't. I do drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a couple on the weekends. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I’m not interested in any of that. Honestly, just trying to keep up with work is enough excitement for me. Parking attendants see everything, you know? I don't need any extra anything.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, regarding allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I get hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and itchy eyes. Nothing serious. And I haven't had any bad reactions to medication, that I remember. I don’t take much, honestly. Just ibuprofen for aches and pains, occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the ibuprofen when I need it. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep... I don't really believe in a lot of those vitamins and supplements. Feels like a waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we discuss proceeding with PrEP, it's essential that we conduct a physical examination and run some lab tests to ensure you're a suitable candidate. This will help us to establish a baseline and monitor your health throughout the process. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I figured there'd be some tests involved. I just want to get this done, if it's possible. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Let's get it over with, if you don’t mind. I have to get back to work eventually, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and we'll begin with a basic physical assessment. I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and performing a quick neurological exam. After that, we’ll draw some blood for testing. It will take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My back isn’t what it used to be, standing all day at that parking lot.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/90. That's a bit elevated, Ms. Trefren. Reflexes are normal, sensation intact. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. We'll need to repeat that reading and potentially monitor it further. Now, I’ll need to draw some blood for HIV testing, as well as a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. This will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Oh, dear. Is that bad? I haven’t checked it in ages. I just… I don’t like going to the doctor. I try to avoid it. And… what exactly does all that blood testing involve? I’m not good with medical terms. Is it a lot? I just want to make sure I’m not going to faint or anything. I’ve seen people faint when they get their blood drawn. It's… unpleasant to watch.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure, left untreated, can lead to serious health problems. It's not something to ignore, but it’s also often manageable with lifestyle changes or medication. We’ll need to monitor it closely. As for the blood tests, it's a standard procedure. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm – about a couple of vials. It will be sent to the lab for analysis. The complete blood count checks your red and white blood cells, the metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, and the lipid panel measures your cholesterol levels. It's not painful, though you may feel a brief pinch. And it’s very rare for someone to faint, but we'll have you lie down during the procedure just to be safe. It’s a necessary step, Ms. Trefren, to ensure you're a suitable candidate for PrEP and to monitor your health throughout the process. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Just… please be quick. And try not to poke too much, if you don’t mind. I bruise easily. No, I think I understand. Red and white blood cells, kidneys, liver… cholesterol. It all sounds… unpleasant. But if it’s necessary, then okay. Just… let’s get it over with. I really need to get back to work. I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table, and extend your arm. I’ll use a tourniquet to make your veins more prominent, and then quickly draw the necessary samples. Try to relax your arm, and breathe deeply. It will only take a few minutes. There, that’s done. Just a small bandage to apply, and you’re all set. Please keep that bandage on for at least an hour. Now, the lab results will typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine if PrEP is appropriate for you. Do you have any questions before you get dressed?
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t so bad. A little sore, but nothing I can’t handle. Two to three days… Ugh. That feels like a long time. Is there anything I can do to speed things up? I’m really trying to get this done quickly. I just… it’s a complicated situation, and I’d really like to have some peace of mind. And… what if the results aren’t good? What if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do to speed up the lab processing time. It takes time for them to analyze the samples accurately. As for the possibility of abnormal results, that’s why we’re conducting these tests in the first place. If anything is abnormal, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and develop an appropriate plan of care. It may involve further testing, lifestyle changes, or medication. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. We'll review the results together, Ms. Trefren. If any issues are identified, we'll refer you to the appropriate specialist for further evaluation and management. Now, before you leave, I’m going to provide you with some written instructions regarding the blood draw and potential side effects. I also want to discuss safe sex practices and provide you with resources for HIV prevention. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, safe sex practices… Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm a little past needing that lecture. But… okay. I guess. If you insist. Resources for HIV prevention… That's good, I suppose. It's better to be informed. Just… please be quick about it. I really need to get back to work. And thank you. For… everything. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. This pamphlet outlines various methods for reducing your risk of HIV transmission, including the use of condoms and PrEP. It also provides information on HIV testing and treatment. I understand you may be feeling impatient, Ms. Trefren, but it's important to have a comprehensive understanding of these resources. Before you leave, I want to schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately one week from today to discuss your lab results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week… That’s… okay. I guess. It’s better than nothing. As long as it doesn’t conflict with my shift. I’ll have to check my schedule. Is there anything else? Honestly, I feel like I've been here for hours. I just want to get back to my normal life, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Trefren, that is all for today. I’ll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment. Please call us if you experience any adverse reactions to the blood draw, such as excessive bleeding or pain. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for your patience as well. Have a good day, Ms. Trefren.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
