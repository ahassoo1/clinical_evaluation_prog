DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s been a bit of a bother, honestly. I just… I don’t feel right. Everything I eat seems to just sit with me, and I get sick to my stomach pretty easily now. And I don’t get hungry like I used to. It’s… well, it’s hard to explain. It just feels like I fill up so fast.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Kelder. It sounds quite uncomfortable. So, you're experiencing a feeling of fullness quickly when you eat, along with nausea and a decreased appetite. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear, when did it start… that’s a good question. Everything’s a bit blurry these days, you know? I think it was… after my treatments ended. Maybe a couple of months ago? It wasn’t sudden, it just… crept up on me. I used to enjoy my meals so much, but now… I just don't have much of an appetite. I try to eat, because I know I should, but it's just not pleasant anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, and it's perfectly alright if the timing is a little unclear. It sounds like this developed gradually after your treatments concluded. It's good you're aware of needing to maintain your nutrition even when it's difficult. Now, could you describe a typical meal for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical meal… well, it used to be something nice. My husband, bless his soul, he was a wonderful cook. We loved roast chicken, mashed potatoes, that sort of thing. Now… I mostly have soup. It’s easy to get down, you know? Or maybe just a little bit of toast. I try to have some fruit, but even that doesn’t always stay down. It’s… small portions now. Very small. I don’t want to make a mess, or feel sick all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Soup and toast, small portions… that gives me a good idea. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, I’ve been more tired than usual, I suppose. Just generally worn out. And… sometimes my stomach hurts a little, a dull ache, not sharp. It comes and goes. And… I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel looser, but I haven’t really weighed myself recently. My granddaughter keeps telling me I should, but… I don’t like numbers. They never tell the whole story, do they?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Increased fatigue, a dull abdominal ache, and some unintentional weight loss. Those are all important things to know. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any significant medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had… the cancer, of course. They said it was in my stomach. That was… a while back. I had surgery and… treatments. They said it was all gone, but… you never really know, do you? Other than that… just the usual old lady aches and pains. Arthritis in my hands, mostly. And I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a long time ago though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kelder. That’s important information. So, a history of stomach cancer with subsequent surgery and treatments, arthritis in your hands, and a previous gallbladder removal. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take something for my arthritis. It’s a little white pill. My granddaughter makes sure I have it. And… I used to take something for my stomach, after the surgery, but the doctor took me off of it a while back. Said I didn’t need it anymore. That was after I finished all the treatments. I can’t remember the names of anything, I’m afraid. It’s all just a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mrs. Kelder, don’t worry about remembering the names. You mentioned medication for arthritis. Do you know the dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… dosage? No, I have no idea. I just take one every morning, with my breakfast. My granddaughter, Sarah, she handles all of that. She puts them in little containers, so I don’t get confused. She’s a good girl, that Sarah. I’m afraid I’m not much help with the details. I just trust she’s giving me the right amount.
DOCTOR: I understand, and it's good you have Sarah helping you manage your medications. It’s perfectly okay if you don’t know the details. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything. Sarah always asks me when I see new doctors, and I always tell her, "no allergies." I don't get hives or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I think. I try to avoid shellfish though, it just doesn't sit well with me, but that's not an allergy, just a preference, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No known allergies, just a preference to avoid shellfish. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… that’s a long story. My mother, she had high blood pressure. And my father… he had heart trouble. He didn’t take care of himself, smoked too much, you know? My brother, he had diabetes. And… my sister, she had something with her nerves, I think. It made her hands shake. It's all a bit blurry, honestly. We weren’t a very healthy bunch, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. History of high blood pressure, heart trouble, diabetes, and a neurological condition in the family. Finally, are you a smoker, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. He said it was the worst thing he ever did. He tried everything to get me to try one, but I always said no. I always told him, "Smoke your fill, but leave me out of it." I always believed in taking care of my health, as much as I could.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kelder. That’s very good to know. Alright, Mrs. Kelder, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It sounds like you've been through quite a lot, and I appreciate your patience and honesty. Based on what you've told me – the decreased appetite, early satiety, nausea, weight loss, and history of stomach cancer – I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you know? My granddaughter keeps worrying about me, and I don’t want to cause her any trouble. So, yes, a physical exam sounds good. Just let me know if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, Mrs. Kelder, but no obvious masses. Your heart and lungs sound clear. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but based on this initial exam, and your history, I'm concerned about a possible recurrence of your cancer, or perhaps another issue affecting your digestive system. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some tumor markers. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be helpful to get a better look at what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A recurrence? That doesn't sound good, does it? I… I suppose if that's what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood work and a scan… yes, that sounds alright. I trust your judgement. Just… please, tell me everything you find, okay? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Kelder. I understand your concerns, and I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. We will discuss all the results thoroughly, and I will explain everything in a way that you understand. I’m sending the orders to the lab and radiology department now. The lab work can be done today, and we should have the results within a few days. The CT scan will likely be scheduled for later this week, depending on availability. Sarah can help you with scheduling that, if you'd like. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help with the nausea and decrease the feeling of fullness. It’s called Metoclopramide. It can help speed up digestion. We'll start with a low dose. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, nausea medicine sounds wonderful, Doctor. Anything to help. Metoclopramide… yes, that sounds fine. A low dose sounds better, too. I don't want to feel… sluggish. And thank you for suggesting Sarah help with the scan. She's very good at those things. So, blood work today, scan later this week, and this medicine for the nausea… Is there anything else I need to do? Or know? It's all a bit overwhelming, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kelder. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. For now, try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don't feel hungry. Avoid foods that are greasy or spicy, as those can worsen the nausea. And stay hydrated – sip on clear fluids throughout the day. I’ll also give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the medication instructions, information about the blood work and CT scan, and my contact information should you have any questions. Now, I'm going to give you a prescription for the Metoclopramide. It's a low dose, 10mg, three times a day before meals. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you to write everything down. Small meals, clear fluids… I can do that. And yes, I think I do have a question. This medicine… will it make me sleepy? I like to stay busy, you know? And I don't want to be stuck in bed all day.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mrs. Kelder. Metoclopramide can cause some drowsiness in some patients, but it's not very common, especially at the low dose I’m prescribing. If you do experience any significant drowsiness, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We can adjust the dosage or explore other options. We’ll also keep a close eye on you during your follow-up appointment, to see how you’re responding to the medication. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and kind. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Small meals, clear fluids, watch for sleepiness, follow up appointment… I'll try to remember everything. And I'll have Sarah help me with the scheduling. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kelder. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, remember to prioritize your well-being. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we'll work together to get you feeling better. Have a good day, Mrs. Kelder. And please, take care.
