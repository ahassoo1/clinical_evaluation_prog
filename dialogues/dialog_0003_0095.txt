DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Concise? Really. Well, it started yesterday morning. I woke up and… couldn't hear out of my right ear. Just… nothing. And my face feels… weak on that side. Like it’s drooping a little. It’s quite alarming, frankly. Is that all you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Right. Yesterday morning, hearing loss, facial weakness. Any pain associated with either?
PATIENT: Pain? No, thankfully. No pain at all. Just… this unsettling silence and the feeling that half my face is going to slide off. It’s more inconvenient than painful, if you understand. Though, truthfully, it is rather frightening.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has this happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. And I assure you, I’ve had a life. It just… came on suddenly. Which is, I should think, rather concerning, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, sudden onset is… noteworthy. Let’s review some basics. Any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections? Good heavens, no. Not since I was a child, and those were… decades ago. I’ve always been quite careful about keeping things clean and dry. This isn’t some childhood ailment resurfacing, I can assure you. This feels… different. Much more serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely none. I prefer to keep my system… pure. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, you see. I don't just pop pills for every little thing. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Because frankly, I have commitments.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Neurological issues? Now you’re asking me to be a medical historian. My mother had… arthritis, I suppose. And my uncle… well, he wasn’t very bright, if that counts. But nothing serious, nothing that would explain this. Honestly, I’m starting to feel as if you’re grasping at straws. Is there a test you can do instead of asking me about my relatives?
DOCTOR: A neurological exam is indicated. Please remain still. I'm going to assess your cranial nerves. Open your mouth, please. Say "Ah."
PATIENT: Ah. There. Perfectly clear, I should think. Is that satisfactory? I do have a rather strong voice, you know. I used to sing, professionally. Though, I suppose that’s irrelevant. Can we move this along?
DOCTOR: Palate elevates symmetrically. Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your face. Can you tell me which side I’m touching each time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel it. Forehead… cheek… chin. It's all perfectly obvious, Doctor. I’m not… impaired, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, I feel rather silly being poked like this. Is this going to lead to a diagnosis, or are we just… playing games?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, smile for me. Note facial droop on the right side. Now, raise both of your eyebrows. Right eyebrow elevation is diminished. These findings are… concerning. I’m suspecting Bell's Palsy. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your insurance status, a full MRI is… unlikely to be immediately accessible. I can prescribe a course of corticosteroids. It may help reduce inflammation. However, without imaging, a definitive diagnosis is… problematic.
PATIENT: Corticosteroids? Inflammation? Honestly, Doctor, you're prescribing drugs without even knowing what's wrong? That sounds… reckless. And my insurance status is hardly relevant to the quality of care I should receive. It’s simply a fact. I’d prefer a proper diagnosis, not a hopeful guess and a prescription. Is there anything else you can do to determine the cause before resorting to… pharmaceuticals? Because frankly, I am not inclined to simply hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns. However, given the circumstances, and without access to more comprehensive testing, Bell's Palsy is the most plausible explanation. Corticosteroids are a standard treatment, and while not a cure, they can improve outcomes. We can refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation, but the wait time could be considerable. Ultimately, the decision is yours. I can write the prescription now, or we can schedule a consultation. I must advise, however, that delaying treatment may not be in your best interest.
PATIENT: A neurologist? More waiting? Honestly, this is becoming quite tiresome. Fine. Write the prescription. But I hold you entirely responsible if it doesn’t work. And don't expect me to be pleased. I'm simply doing this to be done with it. Just… get it over with. And tell me exactly what this drug is supposed to do. I'm not taking anything blindly.
DOCTOR: Very well. This is Prednisone, a corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation around the facial nerve, which may alleviate your symptoms. It does not address the underlying cause, only the inflammation. Dosage is 60mg daily for five days, then tapering off as directed on the label. Be aware of potential side effects, such as mood changes, increased blood sugar, and fluid retention. I’m also providing a handout detailing these risks. I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Side effects? Wonderful. More things to worry about. No, Doctor, I have no further questions. I simply want to leave. I’ve wasted enough of my time here. I trust you've documented everything thoroughly. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, have a… day. .
