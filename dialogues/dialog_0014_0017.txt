DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bartok, good to see you. Or… as good as can be, I suppose, when someone’s needing to come to the doctor. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The… the tryout. For the… team. It's about getting checked, right? To see if I'm… still able. I think that's what my… the people called about. It's been a while. A long while.
DOCTOR: Okay. A physical for a team tryout. And you said it’s been a long while since you’ve… been cleared, or had a check-up?
PATIENT: Yes. A long while. Honestly, I don’t… remember exactly. Maybe… before the divorce? It was a… baseball team, I think. Or softball. Something with a ball. My… my ex-wife liked to watch. She always complained I wasn’t careful enough running the bases. Always a worrywart, that one.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, we’ll try to get some things sorted out. Let’s start with what's going on now. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little… stiffness, maybe. In the… knees. Old injuries, probably. I used to be very… active. Very. But nothing I can’t walk off. It's… normal, for a man my age. You get… wear and tear. Like an old car.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wear and tear” in the knees. Any pain with walking?
PATIENT: Not… with walking, exactly. More when I… stop. Or get up after sitting a long time. It just… takes a minute. Like the engine needs to warm up. You know? Everything gets rusty. Like old tools. I used to be good with tools, very good. My father… he taught me everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so stiffness when you start moving after resting. Does it feel like a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not sharp. Not like getting hit, you know? More… a grinding, maybe. Like… sandpaper. When you rub wood. It's hard to explain. It’s just… there. Doesn’t stop me from doing things, though. I still do a lot of work. Heavy lifting, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grinding sensation. And you said you do some heavy lifting. Roughly how much weight are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… bags of cement. Bricks. Lumber. The usual. I’m a… a helper. Construction. It's… honest work. Not like some of those office jobs. Always moving. Always doing. I’m not one for sitting around. I need to use my hands.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. When you lift these bags of cement, bricks, and lumber – roughly, what would you say each one weighs?
PATIENT: Cement? Oh, those are… heavy. Maybe fifty pounds? A little more, sometimes. Bricks… a lot less. Twenty, maybe? Twenty-five? They come on pallets, you see. I don't really weigh them. I just… pick them up. I used to be able to lift a lot more. Back in my prime. Everything gets smaller, you know. Even… your strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Let’s try a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your range of motion, strength, and listen to your joints. That'll give me a better idea of what's going on with those knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Yes. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. And I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you don't mind me saying. It reminds me of… the divorce lawyers. Always digging around.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, we'll start with your knees. I just need you to bend and straighten your legs as much as comfortable. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright. Bent and straighten. Like… a gate? My father used to have a wooden gate. Always squeaking. Needed oil, you see. Everything needs oil. Even… the body, I suppose. But don't go poking too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. A little discomfort when extending your right leg, slight crepitus noted. Noted. Now, can you bend your knee as far as you can, bringing your heel towards your buttock?
PATIENT: Ooh. That's… that's about as far as it goes. It feels… tight. Like a rubber band. A very old rubber band. Used to be able to do that with no problem. Back in… well, you know. Everything gets stiff. Like… old pipes. Always leaking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some mild tenderness along the medial joint line. No significant swelling or warmth. Now, can you try pushing your leg down into the table, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: There. That's… not bad. But it’s… weaker than it used to be. Everything gets… smaller. Like… a deflating tire. I used to be able to push a lot more. A lot. Back… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. The left knee is also a bit stiff with mild tenderness, and some diminished strength compared to what I would expect. Let's check your reflexes and strength in your ankles and feet, just to get a complete picture. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Sitting. Everything… cracks. Like… dry wood. Needs water. Always something needs water. Or oil. Or… fixing. Back in… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. I’m going to check the reflexes in your ankles. Just relax your legs. Now, let's look at your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh. Well, the divorce. That was… a condition. A bad condition. Lots of stress. Lots of… lawyers. And I think I had… the flu once. Or maybe it was a cold. It’s all a blur, to be honest. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to. Waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this differently. Any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just… something for the heartburn sometimes. It acts up when I eat too much… spicy food. I like my food spicy. My ex-wife didn't. She liked… bland everything. And… oh, sometimes I take something for… aches. Just when they're really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. What is the name of the medication you take for heartburn, and the one for aches?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… For the heartburn, it's… a little purple pill. That's all I know. A little purple pill. And for the aches… it’s white. A small, white pill. They come in a bottle. I think my daughter buys them for me. She's a… a nurse, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had any trouble. I eat… everything. I like food. My ex-wife was always worried about… germs. Always washing her hands. Always being careful. I like… a little dirt. Builds character.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Given your history and the limitations of what we’ve been able to discuss today, I’m going to order some blood work and an X-ray of both knees. That will help me assess the underlying cause of your stiffness and pain and rule out any more serious conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and… pictures? Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do. And I don’t like needles. Reminds me of… you know. Lawyers. Always poking around. But if it gets me back to… work, then fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is right down the hall. And the X-ray technician is just across the courtyard. Once you've had those done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can review the results and discuss a plan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you develop any fever, swelling, or redness in your knees, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… No, I think I’m good. Just… when will I get the pictures? And can I still… work while I’m waiting? I need to work. It’s important. Always been important. And… don't tell my daughter about the blood work. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: The X-ray results usually come back within a few days. As for work, I wouldn’t advise heavy lifting until we’ve had a chance to review the results, but light activity should be fine. We’ll have a better idea after we see what the images show. I'll give you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory to manage any discomfort in the meantime. Here are the orders for the blood work and X-ray, and the prescription. Please schedule that follow-up appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For not… poking too much. And for not asking about… everything. It's been a… long time. And I don't remember much of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Bartok. Get well soon. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
