DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about…well, it’s unpleasant to talk about, frankly. I noticed some blood in my stool. Yes, blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And at my age, concerning is a very strong word, you know. I don't need a lot of fuss about it though.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It is concerning, and you’re right to bring it to my attention. At 88, we take these things seriously. “Not a lot” is still something we need to investigate. Now, can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was…red. Blood is red, isn’t it? I’m not a doctor, you know. Is there a specific shade of red I should have been looking for? Honestly, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous. I've lived a long life, and I’ve seen things...this isn't exactly a groundbreaking medical mystery.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, blood is red. I apologize for the overly specific question. What I was trying to ascertain is whether it was bright red, dark red, or mixed with anything else – like black or tarry stool. And was it on the surface of the stool, mixed in with it, or around the stool itself?
PATIENT: Around it, mostly. And it wasn’t…a huge amount. More like streaks, you understand? Not coating the whole thing. And it was…well, it looked like normal red, if that makes any sense. I didn’t go examining it under a microscope or anything. I'm a pilot, not a… a stool analyst! Honestly, you young doctors ask the strangest questions these days. Back in my time, a doctor just looked at you and knew what was wrong.
DOCTOR: Streaks of bright red blood around the stool. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think...it's been… a week, maybe? A week and a couple of days. It wasn't every day, mind you. Just a few times. I thought it might just be something I ate, but then it happened again, so I thought I should get it checked. Though I still think it’s probably nothing serious. My constitution is excellent, you know. Even at my age. Flying keeps a man sharp.
DOCTOR: A week and a couple of days, intermittent. And you haven’t noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? What kind of changes are you talking about? Look, I'm an old man. Things change. My knees ache more, my memory isn't what it used to be, I nap more… are you asking about my… digestive habits? Because, honestly, I try not to dwell on those. If you must know, everything else seems… regular enough. As regular as it can be at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Let's focus on the stool then. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in your bowel movements – like diarrhea or constipation – along with the blood?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Well, my stomach does grumble sometimes, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? No pain, exactly. And no…diarrhea or… what was the other one? Consti… constipation. No, not particularly. Things have been…passable. Look, I haven't been paying close attention to every single trip to the bathroom, alright? I have a life, even at 88. I used to fly planes all over the world, you know. I don’t need to dissect my… output.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. No abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmph. Well… my clothes have been feeling a bit looser, now that you mention it. But that could be because I haven't been eating as much. The food just doesn't taste the same anymore. And frankly, cooking for one is a chore. It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything. Just…less appetite. A bit of shrinkage, perhaps. But nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Decreased appetite, slight weight loss. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Known conditions? Oh, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a whole ordeal, back in those days. And I broke my wrist once, landing a particularly rough plane. Oh, and I had the flu a few times, like everyone else. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been a healthy man. Good genes, I suppose. And a lot of fresh air, flying around. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick. And she was probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed in childhood, broken wrist. No other significant medical history. Any family history of colon cancer, rectal bleeding, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family history… that's a tricky one. My mother died of pneumonia when I was young, and my father… well, he just sort of faded away. I didn't pay much attention to what ailed them, frankly. We weren't a family that discussed ailments. And honestly, there were a lot of…complicated relations. I doubt anyone ever kept track of colon cancer or… what was the other one? Bleeding. No, I don’t recall anyone having those problems. Mostly heart trouble and…old age. Though my Uncle Harold was a bit of a drinker...and he wasn't feeling well towards the end. But that was probably the whiskey.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known family history of colon cancer or rectal bleeding. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. No, not really. I take a little something for my knees, sometimes. Just when they're acting up. And I take a multivitamin, I suppose, but that's more for peace of mind. My daughter keeps telling me I should take something for my blood pressure, but I haven’t bothered. I prefer to keep things natural. I don’t trust those…chemicals. And I certainly don’t go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. That’s what I tell her, anyway. Though, I suppose, that multivitamin barely counts.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Multivitamin occasionally, something for the knees. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve eaten everything, flown everywhere, breathed all sorts of air. I'm a tough old bird. I don't do allergies. Though, I remember getting stung by a bee once when I was a boy… that wasn't pleasant, but it didn't exactly send me into anaphylactic shock. No, I'm not allergic to anything. Unless you count bad food, but that's just common sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, given your age and the intermittent rectal bleeding, even though you describe it as minimal, we need to investigate this further. I'd like to perform a digital rectal exam and a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… what exam? Look, I came in here because of a bit of blood, not to be… poked and prodded. I’m not keen on that sort of thing, you know. I’m a man of dignity! And at my age, a bit of…intrusion…well, it just seems unnecessary. Is there nothing else we can do? A blood test, perhaps? A scan? I’d much prefer that to… that. Honestly. I came to a doctor, not a… well. You understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. A digital rectal exam is a standard procedure for evaluating rectal bleeding, and it’s the most direct way to assess the area and potentially identify the source of the bleeding. It takes only a few moments, and it’s often the first step in determining if further investigation is needed. We can do blood work to check your overall health, and a scan might be considered later, depending on the findings. However, without a physical examination, we're working in the dark. It allows me to assess for any masses, tenderness, or other abnormalities that might be causing the bleeding. And honestly, given your age, it's important to rule out anything serious. I can explain the procedure in more detail if you'd like, and I'll be as gentle and respectful as possible. If you’re still not comfortable, we can discuss alternative options, but I want to be clear that they may not be as informative. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But I want it over with quickly. And gently, you said? Very gently. I haven't been…examined…in decades. And I don’t intend to start now, if I can avoid it. Though I still think it's a ridiculous procedure for a man of my age. But, go ahead. Get it over with. Just...be quick about it. And explain what you're doing as you go. I don’t want any surprises. Honestly. I’m trusting you here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your willingness. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. I'll be applying some lubricant to make it more comfortable. I’m simply checking for any abnormalities, tenderness, or the source of the bleeding. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Alright, here we go. I’m applying the lubricant now… just a cool sensation. I'm gently inserting my finger… assessing the walls of the rectum… I’m feeling the prostate gland… it feels slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. The rectal walls feel smooth, and I don’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. I do notice some dried blood on my finger, which correlates with your report. The internal sphincter feels normal. Alright, that’s all done. I’ll clean up now. It only took a moment, as I promised. The prostate feels enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this point. The presence of dried blood is also noted. Now, I would like to order a fecal occult blood test - a stool sample test to detect hidden blood. We also need to consider a complete blood count to check for anemia. And I would recommend a colonoscopy to fully investigate the source of the bleeding. It's the most thorough way to examine the colon and rule out any polyps or other abnormalities. What are your thoughts on a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy, you say? Oh, dear. That sounds…invasive. I’ve heard stories. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if you didn’t find anything… particularly alarming… Couldn't we just…monitor things for a bit? I’m not sure I’m up for a full investigation at my age. Though I suppose, if you insist... Tell me, what exactly does it involve? And is it painful? Honestly. I’m starting to regret coming here. At least the poking and prodding is over for now. A colonoscopy… hmph. It sounds dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy does sound daunting, and the preparation isn’t pleasant, I won’t lie. However, given your age and the rectal bleeding, it’s the most responsible course of action. While the digital exam didn't reveal anything immediately concerning, it’s not a comprehensive evaluation. A colonoscopy allows us to visualize the entire colon and identify any polyps, inflammation, or other abnormalities that could be causing the bleeding. Polyps, even small ones, can sometimes be precancerous, and early detection is crucial. The procedure itself is performed under sedation, so you’ll be comfortable and likely won’t remember much of it. A thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the rectum and advanced through the colon. We can then examine the lining of the colon and remove any polyps if necessary. It’s generally a very safe procedure, but like any medical intervention, there are some risks, such as bleeding or perforation, but those are rare. The preparation involves a special diet and bowel cleansing solution to empty the colon completely. That’s the most unpleasant part, frankly. It involves several trips to the bathroom. But it’s essential for a clear visualization. I understand you’re not keen on this, and we can certainly discuss alternatives, but they won’t provide the same level of certainty. We could repeat the fecal occult blood test regularly, but that only detects the presence of blood, not the source. We could also monitor your symptoms closely, but that means potentially missing an early-stage problem. I’d strongly recommend the colonoscopy, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s the most responsible way to ensure your health and peace of mind. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. You’ve worn me down. But I want everything explained to me in detail. The preparation, the procedure, the risks… everything. And I want a very experienced doctor performing it. Not some… trainee. Honestly. And I want someone to hold my hand during the sedation. I'm not going through this alone. Though I still think it's a ridiculous amount of fuss over a bit of blood. But if you insist, I suppose I'll grit my teeth and get it over with. Just... promise me you'll take good care of me. I'm an old man, you know. A fragile one at that. And this all sounds terribly…invasive. When would we schedule it? And what do I need to do to prepare? Honestly. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I promise we’ll take excellent care of you. We'll schedule it with Dr. Albright, she is our most experienced gastroenterologist. And, of course, you will have a nurse with you the entire time, and they will gladly hold your hand during the sedation, or do whatever makes you most comfortable. Let me explain everything in detail. The preparation involves starting a clear liquid diet the day before the procedure. You’ll also need to drink a special bowel cleansing solution, which will cause frequent trips to the bathroom. It’s not pleasant, but it’s essential to empty the colon for a clear visualization. On the day of the procedure, you’ll come to the endoscopy center, and we’ll administer sedation intravenously. You’ll be monitored closely throughout the procedure. Dr. Albright will insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum and advance it through the colon. She’ll examine the lining of the colon and remove any polyps if necessary. The procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. After the procedure, you’ll recover in the recovery room until the sedation wears off. You’ll likely feel some cramping and bloating, but that should subside within a few hours. You’ll be able to go home the same day, but you’ll need someone to drive you. The risks of colonoscopy are rare, but they include bleeding, perforation, and infection. However, Dr. Albright is highly skilled, and we take every precaution to minimize those risks. I’ll give you detailed written instructions on the preparation and post-procedure care. We’ll schedule the procedure for next week, giving you plenty of time to prepare. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Next week… alright. As long as it’s with Dr. Albright. And the hand-holding is a must. Honestly, it all sounds… dreadful. But if you promise to take good care of me, I suppose I can face it. Give me the written instructions, and let's get it scheduled. I'd like it done as quickly as possible, so I don't have to dwell on it. And make sure someone experienced will be monitoring me during the sedation. I don't want any… complications. Honestly. A bit of blood… it's just turned into a whole ordeal. But if it makes you happy, I suppose I can endure it. Yes. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. Here are the detailed instructions, including a list of foods to avoid, the bowel preparation instructions, and what to expect on the day of the procedure. And here is a scheduling form. We'll book it with Dr. Albright for the earliest available appointment, which is next Thursday morning. I’ve already noted your request for experienced nursing care during sedation, and we will ensure you have a highly skilled nurse with you throughout the entire process. She will be monitoring you closely and will be there to provide comfort and reassurance. I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: I suppose not. Just… try to be gentle. And don't let Dr. Albright poke around too much. Honestly, it all sounds… invasive. I’m an old man, you know. Fragile. I just want it over with as quickly and painlessly as possible. And, please, remind the nurse about the hand-holding. It's very important. Yes. Thank you. I think that’s all. I’ll… try to read through this. Though it probably won’t be pleasant. Yes. Thank you. I’ll see you next week, I suppose. Yes. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll take excellent care of you. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your procedure. We’ll see you next Thursday. And rest assured, we’ll be gentle. Take care now.
