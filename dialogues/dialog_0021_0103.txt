DOCTOR: Right, well… have a seat. So, Mr. Vankampen, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes, yes. My back. It’s been botherin’ me. Low part, you know? Hurts to bend… and even just standin’ for too long. It's been goin' on for a while now, but it's worse lately.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "Back pain," right. For a while now… worse lately. Okay. And when you say “a while,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… six months, maybe seven? It started kinda slow, just a little ache after workin’ in the garden. I used to love gardenin’. But it got worse slow, you know? Not like a sudden thing. And now… well, now it’s just always there. Not terrible all the time, but… present. Does that make sense? I’m not good with dates, always forgettin’.
DOCTOR: Right, six to seven months, gradual onset after gardening. "Present"… alright. And is it just when you're bending, or does it radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… does it go anywhere else? Oh… yes, sometimes. Down my leg a little, on both sides, but mostly the left one. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And it gets worse if I try to lift somethin’. Even just groceries, you know? Not heavy groceries, mind you! Just… regular. I don’t lift nothin’ heavy anymore. It’s scary, really.
DOCTOR: Right, radiating down both legs, but more prominent on the left, dull ache… sensible to avoid lifting. So, you've altered your activity level because of this?
PATIENT: Oh yes, Doctor. Changed a lot. Used to walk every mornin’, down to the store for the paper. Now… not so much. I try to, but it just hurts too much. And gardenin’… that’s out of the question. My wife… she used to say I lived in that garden. Now I just sit. It’s not good for a man to just sit, you know? Gets you down. She… she’s gone now. That was… a long time ago. But she loved that garden, too. Sorry, I’m ramblin’. It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss of activity, understandably. And... your wife's passing. Okay. Let's focus on the back pain itself for now. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Back. Yes, sorry. Sometimes… tingling. Mostly in my feet. Not all the time. More at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep, sometimes. Feels kinda… pins and needles, you know? Not awful, but… noticeable. And cold. My feet always feel cold. Even in the summer! My wife used to make fun of me for havin' cold feet. She'd warm 'em up with her hands... But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Tingling in feet, worse at night, sensation of coldness... Any trouble with your bowel or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh. Bowel… bladder? Hmm. No… not really. Everything works… normal, I guess. No trouble there. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes a little trouble startin’, if I wait too long, you know? Old man problems, I suppose. But nothin’ serious. Just… gotta go when I gotta go. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I don’t understand all the medical words you’re using. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, nothing to be alarmed about yet. Just need to gather information. So, no recent changes in bowel or bladder function, just typical age-related issues. Alright. And any history of injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm… nothin’ major. I used to work construction when I was younger, a long, long time ago. Liftin’ things… twistin’… But nothin’ I ever thought much of. Just aches and pains, you know? Old man stuff. I did fall a couple years back, in the garden. Tripped over a hose. Didn’t break anythin’, just bruised my… hip, I think. Didn’t bother my back though. Not that I remember. My memory’s not what it used to be. Sorry, I'm probably not helpin'.
DOCTOR: Right. History of construction work, fall a couple years ago… Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Stand up… Yes, I can do that. Slowly, though. My knees aren’t what they used to be, either. There we go. A little creaky, but I’m up. What do you want me to do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: If you could lie on your back on the examination table, please. I’m going to palpate your spine and check your range of motion. Please let me know if anything causes pain.
PATIENT: Alright… on the table, is it? Yes, I can do that. Here I am. A little chilly, this table is. Please let me know if anything hurts, you said? Yes, I remember. Go slow, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes… that’s… tender. Right there. That’s where it always hurts. Not terrible, but… sensitive. You’re pushin’ pretty hard, Doctor. It’s not a comfortable push.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Tenderness at L4-L5. Okay, now try to bend forward and touch your toes. Don't force it. Just go as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Oh. Bend forward… Right. Oh… there we go. That’s as far as I can go, Doctor. It’s… tight. And hurts. Especially when I go back up. Oof. That was… not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, now lie on your stomach. I need to check your reflexes and sensation.
PATIENT: Alright, on my stomach, is it? Yes. Reflexes… Alright. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, I’m going to test sensation. Tell me when you feel this.
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it… Right there. And here. Yes, I feel it. That one’s a little… tingly. But I feel it. Everything feels… a little numb, really. Especially my feet. It’s hard to tell what I’m feeling sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Diminished sensation in the bilateral feet. Pulses are present, but weak, bilaterally. Skin temperature is cool. Alright, lie back down.
PATIENT: Alright. Lie back down. Yes. It’s cool in here. Pulses weak and cool… not good, is it? What does it mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, it sounds like you have lower back pain with some radiculopathy – that means the pain is traveling down your legs. The diminished sensation and weak pulses in your feet are… concerning. It's likely a combination of age, previous activity, and perhaps some mild peripheral artery disease. I'm going to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out other causes. I also want you to get an X-ray of your lower back to look for any structural problems. And I think it would be best to get a referral to a vascular specialist to evaluate the circulation in your legs.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Radiculo… something? And vascular? That sounds… serious. Blood work, X-rays… It's a lot. Is it bad? Will I need surgery? I don’t like doctors, you know. Makes me nervous. And vascular… that sounds like… legs getting cut off? My wife… she had some trouble with her legs, near the end. I don't want that. What does it all mean?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Vankampen, don’t get ahead of yourself. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything drastic. Radiculopathy just means a nerve is being compressed. The vascular specialist will check the blood flow to your legs. We need to rule things out. The X-ray will show us if there are any broken bones or other problems in your back. Surgery is a last resort. We'll start with conservative treatment – physical therapy, pain management, and monitoring your condition. I’m ordering the blood work and X-ray now. The nurse will schedule the appointment with the vascular specialist for you. Try to stay active, but don't push yourself. And I recommend losing some weight. It will help.
PATIENT: Oh. Conservative… that's good. Not surgery. Yes. Losing weight… I suppose. It’s hard. Alright. Blood work… X-rays… Vascular. I’ll do it. I just… I don’t like all these tests. It makes me worry. Will the nurse explain everything? And what about the pain? It hurts, you know. Is there something I can take for the pain now? Something to get me through until the tests? I just want to feel a little better.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything to you before the tests. And yes, I can prescribe you something for the pain. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever. It’s not a strong medication, but it should take the edge off. Take it as directed. And try to rest. If the pain gets worse, or you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, call the office immediately. I’ve also written a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you some exercises to help strengthen your back and improve your flexibility. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Thank you for the pain reliever. And the physical therapist. No, I… I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… try not to worry, you said? And call if it gets worse. Alright. I’ll do that. Thank you, Doctor Havird. You’ve been very… thorough. I suppose I’ll go get these tests done, then.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Good. Get it done promptly. And follow up with the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
