DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pipkorn, you said? Yes, yes… well, it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been happening… oh, goodness, a while now. Hard to say exactly how long. Feels like longer than it probably is, you know? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Annoying” can be quite debilitating, Mr. Jezik. And it is important to understand the cause. When you say “a while now,” could you perhaps give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… six months? No, wait. Longer. Maybe a year? It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times… well, trying to hold a cup of coffee is a real adventure. I don't remember when it started, exactly. Things… slip my mind these days. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that the exact timing isn't clear, Mr. Jezik. Memory can be… unreliable. Is the shaking constant when it is present, or does it occur with specific activities?
PATIENT: Specific activities… Well, like I said, holding things. Eating… sometimes. Writing, definitely. It's worse when I’m… trying to do something precise. Just sitting here, it's not so bad. Though I think it was a little shaky when I signed my name earlier, now that I think about it. Not much, but… there. It’s just a nuisance, mostly. I hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: I see. Primarily with fine motor skills, exacerbated by attempts at precision. And you haven't noticed it during other times—like when walking, or at rest?
PATIENT: At rest… Not really. When I’m walking, no. Sitting and watching television, no. Sometimes, if I’m… stressed, maybe? But it’s hard to tell if that’s the shaking or just… being old, you know? Everything aches when I'm stressed. I don’t think it’s just the shaking. Sorry, I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Jezik. Providing as much detail as possible is what’s important, and you are doing fine. Now, let's move on to other aspects of your health. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shaking—any stiffness, slowness in your movements, or changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Stiffness… Well, my joints ache, of course. That’s just getting old, isn’t it? But… specifically stiffness with the shaking? No, not really. Maybe a little in my fingers, sometimes, but I figured that was just arthritis. Balance… no, I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk a little slower than I used to, but who doesn't at my age? It’s all going downhill, you know? Sorry. Being gloomy again.
DOCTOR: It's important to rule out other possibilities, Mr. Jezik. Now, regarding your medical history—do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned that once, a long time ago. I took pills for it, for a while. But I stopped. Couldn't remember to take them. It wasn't bothering me, so I figured it wasn't a big deal. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. Heart… maybe something once, but I had a lot of tests and they said I was okay. Honestly, I forget what all they told me. Lots of doctors over the years… it all blends together. Sorry, I'm not much help with this stuff. I mostly just try to avoid going to the doctor in the first place.
DOCTOR: Discontinuing medication can be problematic, Mr. Jezik. And it’s understandable that you may not recall specific details. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. And… I think I had a hernia operation, maybe? Years ago. Something with my stomach. And… Oh, and my knee. They did something with my knee, a long time ago. Arthritis, I think. Lots of little things over the years. Mostly just repairs. I’m falling apart, you know? Sorry, I'm not being very organized. I wish I could remember all the details. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My father… he died of something with his heart, I think. Pretty old, though. My mother… she lived a long time, but she had… well, she just got weak in her old age. She wasn’t really sick, just… faded away. I don't think anyone in my family had anything… like this shaking, though. No. Not that I know of. They didn’t talk about things much. Everyone kept to themselves. Sorry. I’m not very helpful, am I? It’s all a bit of a… blank, really.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. We work with the information we have. Now, regarding your social history—do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never did. Tried it once, didn’t like it. Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner, sometimes. But that was a long time ago. Not anymore. Too much trouble. And… recreational drugs? No, never. I’m an old Czech man, Doctor. We drink beer, not… whatever those young people are doing these days. Sorry. I’m rambling again. It's just… this whole thing is a bit unsettling, you know? A shaking hand isn’t what I expected when I got old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose when the pollen’s bad in the spring, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? Nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Sorry to be so unhelpful. I just… don't remember things very well. It's been a long life, you know? And a lot of doctors. Is that it, then? Do you know what's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for providing that information. Now, based on what you’ve described—the gradual onset of a tremor, primarily affecting your hands with fine motor tasks, and the lack of any significant accompanying symptoms—the most likely possibility is essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition, especially in individuals your age, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a more serious underlying problem. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to perform a brief neurological examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Essential… tremor? Not dangerous? Just… old age? A neurological… exam? Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. As long as it's not something… terrible. I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it all over myself. That’s all. Go ahead, then. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Please have a seat here. I will begin with a simple assessment of your reflexes and coordination. This will involve me asking you to perform a few basic movements, such as touching your nose with your finger and tapping your foot. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. First, can you please extend both of your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Arms… palms up? Yes, yes, I can do that. There. Is that right? They’re a little shaky, you see. But that’s why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Jezik. As I suspected, there is a tremor present, particularly in your hands. Now, I’m going to gently touch your finger with this reflex hammer. This will test your reflexes. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Ooh! That’s… surprising. A little jumpy, you know? It’s been a long time since anyone tapped my knee like that. There. Is that what you wanted? It’s a little sore, but that’s probably just old age again. Go on, then. What’s next? I'm trying to be brave.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, I would like you to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, and alternate between the two as quickly and accurately as possible. Please try to do so without looking at your hand.
PATIENT: This is… harder than it looks. Oh dear… I'm all over the place, aren't I? I used to be good at things like this. But that was a long time ago. Sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Jezik. This is simply to assess your coordination. As expected, there is some difficulty with fine motor skills, and an intention tremor is present. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a simple heel-to-shin test. Please sit on the edge of the examination table and run the heel of your foot along the shin of the opposite leg.
PATIENT: This is… impossible. I can’t seem to control my leg. It feels like it has a mind of its own. I used to be a good dancer, you know. But that was a long time ago. I’m sorry to be such a mess. Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the neurological examination, the findings are consistent with essential tremor. The tremor, the difficulty with coordination, and the dysmetria—all support this diagnosis. Now, essential tremor is a progressive neurological disorder, but its rate of progression varies significantly. It’s often benign, and many individuals live full and active lives with minimal impairment. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as Parkinson's disease or thyroid problems. Therefore, I would like to order some blood tests to assess your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I would also like to consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and potential management options, such as medication or deep brain stimulation, if your symptoms worsen. Would that be acceptable to you, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurologist… medication… It sounds… complicated. Complicated isn’t good. I just wanted to hold a cup of coffee, Doctor. Is it going to get worse? Will I… lose control of everything? If it's not serious, I don't want to bother with tests and specialists. But if it is… well, I suppose I have to do something. Yes, alright. Do the tests. And… if you think I should see a neurologist, then I will. But please… tell me honestly. Is it something terrible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, it’s understandable that you’re concerned. And I want to be upfront with you. Essential tremor can progress over time, but the rate of progression is highly variable. Many individuals experience only mild symptoms, and it doesn’t significantly impact their quality of life. It's important to rule out other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, which presents with different symptoms and requires a different treatment approach. That's why the blood tests and neurological evaluation are important. I don’t believe your condition is currently "terrible," but it does require monitoring and potential management. The goal of treatment is to minimize your symptoms and maintain your independence. We can discuss medication options if the tremor interferes with your daily activities. For now, let’s focus on the blood tests. I will send you to the lab right away. And I will prepare a referral to Dr. Anya Volková, a highly respected neurologist in the city. She can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and discuss long-term management options with you. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Dr. Volková… alright. Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Blood tests first, then see Dr. Volková. As long as it doesn’t mean… losing control. Will the tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting for weeks, worrying about what's going on. I just want to get this sorted out, one way or another. And… is there anything I can do now? To help with the shaking?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are relatively simple—just a small sample of blood will be drawn from your arm. It should be quick and minimally uncomfortable. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will contact you as soon as they are available. As for managing the shaking, there are a few things you can try. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol can sometimes help reduce tremor severity. Stress can also exacerbate symptoms, so practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation can be beneficial. There are also some adaptive tools, such as weighted utensils or cups, that can make everyday tasks easier. I will provide you with a list of resources and adaptive tools before you leave. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s some information for you to take with you. We will get this sorted out, Mr. Jezik. It may take some time, but we will find the best way to manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Now, let's get you to the lab. I will have my nurse, Jana, escort you.
PATIENT: Jana, you said? Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very helpful. And… tell Jana thank you too. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose there’s nothing left to do but wait and see, then. Let’s go to the lab. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Jana will be right with you. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We will be in touch soon. .
