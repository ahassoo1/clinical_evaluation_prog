DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here because I am looking into moving to a senior living facility, and they requested I get a check-up first to be sure I am… suitable, I believe was the word they used. A good place to start, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Suitable.” Right. Well, a comprehensive evaluation is certainly prudent before any major life change. Let's get a good understanding of your current health status. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Well, lately… hmm. I feel about as good as an eighty-one-year-old man can feel, I reckon. No terrible pains, thankfully. My knees ache a bit when the weather changes – always have, always will, I suspect. And I get tired easier than I used to, naturally. But nothing that keeps me from my baking. I still make a good loaf of bread, you know. I run a small bakery, have for many years. It keeps me busy, keeps me… centered.
DOCTOR: Knees with weather changes… predictable. Baking is… commendable, I suppose. Still, we need to be thorough. When you say tired easier, can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. Well, it takes longer to get things done, for one. I used to be able to mix a dozen loaves of bread dough before breakfast, no trouble at all. Now… now it’s more like six, and I need a bit of a rest afterwards. Not exhausted, mind you, just… slower. And I don't have the energy for much else at the end of the day. Mostly just sit and read, or listen to the radio. Nothing strenuous, of course. I used to enjoy gardening, but that's become too much.
DOCTOR: So, a gradual decrease in stamina. Understandable, given your age. Now, besides the fatigue and knee discomfort, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I have a hard time reading the small print now, even with my glasses. And… oh, sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded when I stand up too quickly. It doesn’t last long, just a moment or two, but it’s there. Nothing frightening, mind you. I just hold onto something until it passes. And my memory… well, it’s not perfect, is it? But who remembers everything? I recall dates and faces perfectly, though. Odd, that.
DOCTOR: Diminished eyesight, occasional lightheadedness, subjective memory complaints… “Subjective” being the operative word, of course. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Changes in my hearing… Hmm. I do have to ask people to speak up sometimes. Not all the time, but… yes, I suppose I do. It’s subtle, though. Mostly high-pitched sounds, I think. Birdsong, things like that. I can hear just fine when someone’s speaking directly to me. And I certainly haven’t missed the radio! Though sometimes I need to turn it up a bit louder than I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not as far as I know. I’ve been fortunate, really. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, but that was many years ago and I recovered fully. My family doctor, Doctor Elsworth, always said I had a strong constitution. He passed away a few years back, good man. I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, but he never found anything seriously wrong. Mostly just told me to eat my vegetables and get enough sleep. And I've tried to do just that.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, remote history. And no family doctor currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I haven't needed one, really, until now, with the facility and all. After Doctor Elsworth passed, I just… didn’t bother to find another one. I’m a simple man, you see. I don’t get sick often, so I didn’t see the need. I've always taken care of myself. But I understand it's best to have someone keep an eye on things, even if everything seems alright. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: A rather… unconventional approach to preventative care. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a boy – climbing a tree, foolishness, really – but it healed cleanly. No surgery needed, just a cast. And… oh, I had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was a long time ago. That’s about it, I believe. I’ve been remarkably lucky, all things considered. I’ve always been careful, though. I don’t take unnecessary risks. A Lakota man has to be mindful of his health, you see. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, remote history. And no further surgical interventions. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s… anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, a strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. She had a bit of arthritis in her later years, but nothing serious. My father… he died younger, in his sixties, from a heart attack, I believe. But he smoked heavily, and didn't take care of himself. As for Alzheimer’s or cancer… not that I recall. My family wasn't one for talking about such things, you see. We preferred to focus on the good things in life. It wasn’t something we dwelled on. But I do remember my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had some trouble with her memory in her later years. But I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s, or just old age. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. I’ve always avoided medication if possible. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, perhaps, but that’s about it. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if it can. I take a multivitamin, just to be safe, and I drink plenty of water. But no regular prescriptions, no sir. I believe in a healthy diet and a good night’s sleep, more than anything else. A Lakota man learns to live with what the Earth provides, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Nothing extensive, just a baseline assessment. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand you need to do your job, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm ready when you are. A Lakota man is accustomed to being examined, you see. It’s part of life.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/85. Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are diminished at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. No palpable masses. Tympanic membranes are normal bilaterally, but mild cerumen present. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Alright. Everything appears… within acceptable limits, for your age. However, the murmur and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What sort of investigation, Doctor? Is it something serious? I must admit, I was hoping to avoid any… complicated procedures, if possible. My main concern is simply being able to live comfortably and continue my baking. Perhaps it’s just a sign of old age, as Doctor Elsworth used to say. A little creakiness here and there is to be expected, isn’t it? But I appreciate you being thorough, of course. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be nothing, Mr. Tkac. The murmur could indicate valvular heart disease, and the diminished breath sounds suggest some degree of chronic lung restriction, potentially from mild COPD. To clarify, I recommend a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to assess the structure of your heart and lungs. And a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying infections or metabolic abnormalities. It's standard procedure, given your age and the findings of the exam. It’s not a complicated procedure, and will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. And, frankly, it’s necessary if you’re considering a move to a senior living facility. They will likely require it as well. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood and schedule the X-ray and EKG for you. We’ll review the results together once they’re available.
PATIENT: COPD… I haven’t smoked a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My father did, of course, but I always avoided it. A Lakota man has respect for the air, you see. Still, I understand that things can happen. And I appreciate you explaining it to me. Very well. If it’s necessary, then I suppose I have no choice. And you are right, the facility will likely require it. I suppose it’s best to get it done and over with. Please, let me know as soon as the results are available. I’m eager to get this sorted out, so I can continue my baking. And thank you, Doctor, for your attention to this matter. Please, let me know when I should return to discuss the results. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: My assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. It should be within a week. In the meantime, continue your usual activities, but please refrain from any strenuous exertion. You may proceed to the lab now. They are expecting you.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your guidance. I appreciate your thoroughness.
