DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so I'll just say it. The blood pressure machine at work kept beeping at me. Old Man Hemlock, the safety guy, made me come. Says it was "high." I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that you came in to get this checked out, even if you’re feeling well. Sometimes high blood pressure doesn't have noticeable symptoms. Just to clarify, how many times did the machine beep at you, and approximately when did this start happening?
PATIENT: Beeping? Honestly, I wasn't counting beeps. It was... a couple of times, maybe? Over the last week or so. I mostly ignored it. I’m a civil engineering tech – I deal with real problems, not machines that go “beep.” I don't know, like five times? Maybe more. It's not like I sit around listening for it. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Ms. Dudney, as it helps us get a better picture of what's going on. Even a rough estimate is helpful. "Around five times over the last week" is good. And you said you feel fine – no headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I feel perfectly normal. I wake up, I go to work, I make sure the blueprints are right, I come home. Headaches are for people who don’t drink enough water, and I always have water. Dizziness… well, maybe a little when I’m looking at complicated schematics all day, but that’s not what we’re here for. Look, I just want to know if I need a pill or not. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, that's not hard at all. We'll get to that. I just want to be thorough, as high blood pressure can sometimes be a silent condition, and it's important to rule out any underlying causes before making a decision about medication. I see here your height is 184 centimeters and your weight is 104 kilograms. Do you mind if I do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a bit self-conscious about my height, okay? Everyone always asks about it. And honestly, poking and prodding isn’t really my thing. Can’t you just… run some tests? Blood work, or something? I don't see why you need to listen to me. It feels a little invasive. Is this going to take long? I have a site inspection this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudney. I apologize if my suggestion felt invasive; that wasn't my intention at all. And I assure you, the physical exam is a standard part of assessing blood pressure, and it provides valuable information. The exam would take just a few minutes. It's not about “listening” to you, but about checking for any signs that might indicate a cause for the high readings. We can order blood work, and that’s something I was planning to do regardless, but the exam helps me determine what tests would be most appropriate. Would you be more comfortable if I explained exactly what I'd be listening for?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But make it quick. And don’t stare. I hate being stared at. Just tell me what you're doing as you’re doing it, don’t make a whole production out of it. Honestly, I don’t understand why someone in civil engineering needs to worry about this anyway. We build things. Solid, practical things. Not… blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your frustration, and you're right – your work is solid and practical. However, ensuring your health allows you to continue that work safely. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Listening to your heart helps me check the rhythm and identify any unusual sounds. Listening to your lungs ensures there’s no congestion or wheezing. Then I'll take your pulse to get a sense of your heart rate. It's a quick check, and it will give me a baseline to compare against the blood pressure readings. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now… rhythm is regular. Now, your lungs… sounds are clear. And finally, your pulse… 78 beats per minute. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, let's get that blood pressure reading again, just to confirm. And then we can discuss ordering some blood work, as you suggested. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And seriously, don't make small talk. I really don’t have time for this. Just tell me the numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, please relax your arm. I'm going to inflate this cuff… and now deflate it slowly… Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's elevated. And the machine at work wasn't malfunctioning. Now, as we discussed, some blood work will help us determine the best course of action. I’d like to check your kidney function, electrolytes, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… make it fast, and tell whoever does the blood work not to poke me too much. Honestly, this is such a waste of a good afternoon. I have actual problems to solve. And are you going to give me a paper to take to someone? I don’t have time to run around to different offices. Can’t you just… do everything here?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I’ll do everything I can to make this as efficient as possible. I’m ordering the blood work now. It’s a standard panel, and shouldn’t take long. You're right to ask about needing a referral. The lab is in the same building, just down the hall. You don't need an appointment, and it typically takes less than 30 minutes. I’ll give you the paperwork now. Once the results are back – typically in 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend making some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing sodium intake and incorporating regular exercise into your routine. I can provide you with some resources if you’d like. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: No. No resources. I know what healthy looks like. And honestly, this whole thing is probably just stress. Building codes are a nightmare, okay? Always changing, always something new. I deal with enough headaches as it is. Just… give me the paperwork, and let me get going. I have a site inspection. And please don’t call me unless it’s an emergency. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Here’s the lab requisition. And I will only contact you if the results are concerning. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Dudney. I hope the site inspection goes smoothly. .
