DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. Workplace… difficulties, shall we say? It's rather tiresome explaining it all. A great deal of… inefficiency, and frankly, a lack of respect for the proper order of things. It’s simply… draining. I used to have such bright students. Now… well, never mind. Let’s just say it’s stressful. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Stressful is certainly a good place to start, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. To help me understand what's going on, and to make sure we’re addressing everything, could you tell me a little more about how this stress is affecting you?
PATIENT: Affecting me? Honestly, Doctor, must you ask such… elementary questions? It affects my sleep, naturally. And my appetite. Though, truthfully, I’ve never been one for excessive eating. It’s a general… weariness. A lack of enthusiasm. I find myself… irritated, easily. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. Utterly senseless. It's a waste of perfectly good time that could be spent… well, never mind. Are we getting somewhere with this, or am I simply recounting my life to you?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing some classic symptoms of stress and, potentially, some mood changes. We want to rule out anything else that might be contributing to these feelings. Have you noticed any physical symptoms along with these things – headaches, stomach problems, changes in your weight, perhaps?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, are you a physician or an… inventory clerk? I am a scholar, not a… body. I suppose my shoulders ache a bit. From carrying the weight of… inadequate colleagues. And perhaps a slight… digestive upset. Though, that could be the cafeteria food. Dreadful stuff, honestly. Is this… necessary? Are you implying I am ill? I assure you, I am perfectly capable. Just… fatigued. By foolishness.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture. Shoulder aches and digestive upset can definitely be related to stress, but it's good to rule out other possibilities. You mentioned a change in appetite – have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Doctor, I’ve always been… slender. It’s a matter of constitution! I don’t indulge in… gluttony. Though, I suppose… my trousers may feel a little looser than they used to. But that’s hardly a matter for medical concern, is it? I assure you, I am not wasting away. I simply… don’t require much sustenance. I live on ideas, you see. Not… pastries. Honestly, this line of questioning is rather… undignified. Are we finished soon? I have papers to grade. And a rather important monograph to review.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s just that even a small change in weight can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything is as it should be. It's quite routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I am not a… specimen. I haven’t been subjected to such indignities in decades! But… very well. If it will expedite this… process, I suppose I can endure it. But I assure you, you will find nothing amiss. Perfectly sound constitution. Just… exhausted. And surrounded by incompetence. Do get on with it, then. I haven’t all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. It won’t take long. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then I'll quickly check your reflexes. Your heart sounds regular, although a little quiet. Breathing sounds clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit on the low side – 100 over 60. I'm just going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a bit weaker than I would expect. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything looks okay there. I'd also like to check your weight again, just to confirm. Weight remains at 117 pounds. Okay, Mr. Schlatterer, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Well. That was… thoroughly unpleasant. And I fail to see what any of that accomplishes. My constitution, as I said, is perfectly sound. Now, are we finished? I have a great deal of work awaiting me. And frankly, this entire experience has been… draining. Perhaps a strong cup of tea would be beneficial. And a quiet room, free from… prodding. Are you going to tell me what you’ve discovered, or must I simply continue to endure this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration. I don't want to cause you any discomfort, but I do have some concerns. Your blood pressure is a bit low, and your reflexes are weaker than expected, and your weight is quite low for your height. Coupled with your reported loss of appetite and fatigue, it suggests we need to investigate further. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It could be something simple, but it's best to be thorough. I want to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. I also recommend a urinalysis. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? Urinalysis? Doctor, are you suggesting I am… ailing? I assure you, I am perfectly capable. But… very well. If it will appease you, and expedite my departure, I suppose I can endure it. But I trust you will find nothing amiss. A slight… weariness, perhaps. Due to the sheer volume of… mediocrity I am forced to encounter. Just… get on with it, then. And please, minimize the… indignities. I have standards, you know. And a monograph awaiting review. It’s quite important. Are there forms I must fill out? This is all rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few forms to fill out. They’re standard paperwork, just to confirm your insurance and medical history. The nurse will assist you with those. The blood work and urinalysis can be done here in the clinic. It will take about an hour or so, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, I’d recommend focusing on getting enough rest and trying to eat small, nutritious meals, even if you don’t feel particularly hungry. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I am a scholar, not a… delicate flower. I have endured dust, mildew, and the incessant droning of… unqualified students. I have no allergies to speak of. Though, I find the scent of cheap cologne rather… offensive. And the sound of incessant chatter… but those are merely… irritations, not allergies. Just… get on with the paperwork, then. The sooner this is over, the sooner I can return to my work. And perhaps have that cup of tea. It’s essential, you know. For… clarity of thought. Do you have any idea how long this will take? I have a deadline looming. A very important deadline.
DOCTOR: The nurse, Sarah, will be right with you to get the paperwork started. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes to complete. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll call you when they’re ready. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, weakness, or confusion – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anyone I can contact if needed?
PATIENT: Contact? Doctor, I am a divorced man. My ex-wife would likely be… unhelpful. And my colleagues… well, let’s just say I prefer to handle my own affairs. No, there is no one to contact. Just… proceed with the tests, then. And please, minimize the waiting. I have a monograph awaiting review. It’s quite important. And frankly, I'm rather losing patience. This entire experience has been… thoroughly draining. Is there anything else? Or may I finally be excused? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Sarah will be with you shortly. Just let her know you're here for the blood work and urinalysis. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
