DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s a bit ridiculous I even have to be here. I’m 51, perfectly healthy, and I want a baby. Shouldn't that be… straightforward? I don’t want any complications, you understand. I don't have time for problems.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, while it can be straightforward, Ms. Shteynberg, “perfectly healthy” requires verification, and even then, there are considerations at your age. It's good you're thinking ahead about complications. Let’s start with a comprehensive history. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, it’s none of your business why. But it wasn’t by choice, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s… irrelevant. I want to know what I need to do to make this happen, not revisit things I’d rather forget. Can we skip the personal questions?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand you're frustrated, but a thorough medical history is essential. It’s not about prying; it’s about ensuring your safety and the potential safety of the baby. We need to rule out any pre-existing conditions that could impact a pregnancy. However, if you are truly unwilling to provide basic information, I can certainly document that refusal. But I must inform you that proceeding without it is… inadvisable. Perhaps we can start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, hypertension, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're getting accusatory? Look, I told you, I’m healthy! I exercise, I eat well – better than most people your age, I assure you. My yearly checkups are always… satisfactory. The doctor always says so. I haven't got a list of illnesses, and I’m not going to pretend I do to satisfy your… protocol. Is this going to take all day? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: “Satisfactory” is subjective, Ms. Shteynberg. And yearly checkups don't always reveal everything. I'm not attempting to be accusatory, but pregnancy places a significant strain on the body. We need to have a baseline understanding of your health status. Fine. Let’s try this. Have you had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: One. A hysterectomy. A long time ago. When I was… younger. It was… complicated. And frankly, I’d rather not discuss it. I assumed that would be… obvious. If I had a hysterectomy, surely that answers your question about being able to have a baby. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy, Ms. Shteynberg?
PATIENT: Yes. A complete one. Unless you think I’m lying. Do I look like the type of woman who would attempt this without… a very good reason? It was decades ago. I should think your… training would cover the implications. Are you even reading my chart? I'm starting to wonder if I’ve made a terrible mistake coming here. Honestly.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Shteynberg. It appears there was a notation about a total hysterectomy in 2012. However, the documentation is… remarkably sparse. It only states the procedure was performed, with no further details regarding the indication or post-operative course. Given this information, attempting a pregnancy is… not medically feasible. Are you aware of this?
PATIENT: Of course I'm aware! Do you think I haven't done my research? I’m not completely ignorant. I was hoping… there might be… advancements. Some sort of… procedure. A transplant, perhaps? I've read things online. I’m not expecting miracles, but I wanted a professional opinion. To see if anything has changed. You don’t have to state the obvious. It’s just… frustrating. And frankly, you're not being very helpful. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, uterine transplantation is an experimental procedure, currently only performed in limited centers, with very strict eligibility criteria. You would need to be evaluated by a specialized transplant team to determine if you are a candidate, and it carries significant risks. Given your history, I’m not going to encourage a pursuit of this option within my practice. I can provide you with a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist who specializes in complex cases, if you wish. However, I must be frank: the likelihood of success is extremely low. Do you want that referral?
