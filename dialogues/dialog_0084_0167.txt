DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been hurting. A sore, really. It won't go away. Been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a while. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s… red and kinda deep. It’s not a big sore, but it hurts when I walk. Especially if I stand for too long. I try to wear soft slippers, but it still bothers me. I think it might be from the sugar sickness, you know? The one the other doctors talk about.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it’s on the bottom of your foot, near your toes, red and deep, and it’s painful with walking and standing. You mentioned “sugar sickness”—do you mean diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Diabetes. That’s what they call it. I forget the long name. My wife, she always remembered, but… well, she’s gone now. But yes, the diabetes. They told me a long time ago I have it. It’s hard to remember everything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's completely normal to have trouble remembering things. And yes, diabetes can definitely cause foot problems. Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with neuropathy, or nerve damage in your feet, related to the diabetes?
PATIENT: Neu… what now? Nerve… damage? I don’t think so. No one ever told me about that. They just said keep the sugar down and watch my feet. I check them sometimes, but I don't really feel anything different, you know? Just the sore. Is that what that is? Is the sore from the nerve damage? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. So no one has specifically mentioned neuropathy to you before. It’s possible to have nerve damage from diabetes without necessarily being told about it directly. Sometimes the symptoms are subtle at first. Let's take a look at the sore. Could you please take off your shoe and sock so I can examine your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Be careful, it’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It does appear red and slightly deeper than the surrounding skin. There’s some warmth to the area, and you’re right, it’s tender to the touch. I don’t see any signs of active infection right now, like pus or significant swelling, but it’s important to monitor it closely. I’m also going to check the circulation and sensation in your foot. I'm going to lightly touch your foot with this cotton ball to see if you can feel it, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Be gentle, please. I’m a little scared of anything poking or prodding. My wife always said I was a baby about these things. But she wasn’t wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me if you feel this on this side?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I feel it a little. But it’s… not as strong as on this side. It’s kinda… numb, maybe? Not completely gone, but… weaker. Like when my arm falls asleep, but not as bad. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good that you can feel something, but you’re right, the sensation is diminished compared to the other side. That does suggest some degree of neuropathy, or nerve damage, which, as we discussed, can be a complication of diabetes. I’m also going to check the pulses in your feet to assess the circulation. I’ll just feel for a pulse here… and here. Your pulses are present, but they’re a little weak. That, combined with the decreased sensation, is something we need to take seriously.
PATIENT: Weak? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? My wife… she always worried about the circulation. She said if the blood doesn't go to your feet… well, she said bad things could happen. I don't want bad things to happen. What do we do now? Should I take some medicine? Or something? I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Mr. Stoegbauer. Weak pulses and decreased sensation are signs we need to address promptly. We definitely want to prevent any further complications. The good news is we can do things to help! First, I want to order some tests. We'll do a blood sugar check to see how well your diabetes is controlled. And I'd like to get a nerve conduction study, which will help us assess the extent of the nerve damage. We should also check the blood flow in your legs and feet. That will give us a better picture of what's going on. For the sore itself, I’m going to clean it and apply a special dressing to keep it protected and promote healing. It’s extremely important you don’t put any pressure on that foot. No walking on it, if at all possible. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests and a special dressing… alright. That sounds… a lot. But if it helps… yes, alright. No walking, you say? Oh dear. I like to go for little walks in the garden. But I understand. I don’t want it to get worse. And I definitely don’t want bad things to happen. Who will do the tests, Doctor? And where? Will I need to come back tomorrow? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I don’t get around as easily anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer. It does sound like a lot, but it's better to be thorough. The blood sugar check we can do right here in the clinic today. The nerve conduction study and the blood flow tests will be done at the imaging center across town. I’ll have my nurse, Leilani, schedule those appointments for you before you leave. She'll give you all the details and instructions. They'll likely need to be done within the next few days. We’ll also want to monitor the sore closely. I’ll have Leilani show you how to change the dressing properly and what signs to watch out for – like increased redness, swelling, pain, or drainage. I want to see you back here in one week to review the test results and see how the sore is healing. For now, focus on keeping pressure off your foot and let’s get these tests scheduled. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a plan. Leilani will schedule everything? That’s good. I appreciate that. One week… okay. I can remember that. Keep pressure off my foot… and watch for bad things. Alright. I think I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was very worried before, but I feel a little better now. I hope these tests aren’t too painful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. The nerve conduction study can be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be overly painful. It’s a quick test, and the technicians will do their best to make you comfortable. Leilani will be in shortly to schedule your appointments and go over everything with you. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Just the foot, and the tests. And Leilani will help. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I’ll try not to worry too much until I see the results. I suppose I should wait for Leilani now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Wonderful. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We're here to help. I’ll let Leilani know to come in right away. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer. .
