DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry lately. Been scratchy, you know? Not good. I just want to get this over with if we could, please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pipolo. Dry, scratchy eyes are certainly uncomfortable, and I'll do my best to help you figure out what’s going on and get you some relief. We’ll take it as quickly as we can, but I do need to ask a few questions to get a good understanding of the problem. First, when did you first start noticing the dryness and scratchiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… hard to say exactly. Maybe… a few months now? It comes and goes. Worse when it's windy, I think. We get a lot of wind where I live, near the water. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Wind exposure can absolutely contribute to dry eyes. So, a few months of intermittent dryness, worse with wind… alright. Now, besides the scratchiness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… feels like there’s sand in ‘em sometimes. And… blurry vision now and then. Mostly when I’ve been out working. I do cement work, you know? Lots of dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, sand-like sensation and occasional blurry vision, especially with dust exposure from cement work. That’s helpful information. Do you wear any glasses or contacts, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed ‘em. Eyes were always good, until this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no corrective lenses. Have you tried anything so far to try and relieve the dryness?
PATIENT: Just… blinking a lot. Doesn’t seem to help much, though. Maybe some water, but that doesn’t stay for long.
DOCTOR: Blinking and water… I appreciate you trying those. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or Sjogren's syndrome?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Sjogren's… what is that? I don’t think so. I mostly just… work. Get tired, sometimes. Haven't been to a doctor in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Sjogren's syndrome is a condition that can cause dryness in the eyes and mouth, among other things. It’s good to know you haven't been diagnosed with anything like that. And it’s alright if you haven’t seen a doctor in a while; that’s why you’re here now. Now, have you had any eye injuries or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Just… dust. And wind. You get a lot of both doing cement work, you know? I’ve been doin’ it a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Cement work can be very harsh on the eyes. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no pills. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. For work. I don't take nothin' else.
DOCTOR: Alright, just coffee. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick eye exam. I'll check your vision, look at the surface of your eyes, and assess tear production. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, whatever you need to do. Just… hurry if you could? I got work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. Okay, let's start with your vision. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Ugh, that small print… Okay, okay… E… H… F… I think that’s right. These are blurry. Hard to see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Your vision is slightly reduced, but not dramatically so. Now I'm going to take a look inside your eyes. This won’t hurt, just look straight ahead. Okay, the retinas look good. No significant abnormalities there. Now I’m going to check your tear production. I'll gently place a small strip of paper near your lower eyelid to measure how much your eyes are tearing. Alright. The Schirmer test shows that you have reduced tear production in both eyes. This confirms some degree of dry eye. I'm also going to use a special dye to look for any damage to the surface of your cornea. Okay, I see some mild superficial punctate keratitis in both eyes – small areas of damage on the cornea, likely from dryness and irritation. So, to summarize, you're experiencing symptoms of dry eye – scratchiness, sandy sensation, occasional blurry vision – and the exam confirms reduced tear production and some minor corneal damage. This is likely exacerbated by your work environment.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it serious? And what can you do about it? I gotta get back to work, you know.
DOCTOR: It means your eyes aren't producing enough tears to keep them comfortably lubricated. It’s not usually serious in itself, but chronic dryness can lead to discomfort and, in some cases, can increase the risk of infection. Given your work, it’s very likely that dust and wind are major contributing factors. Fortunately, there are several things we can do. First, I recommend using over-the-counter artificial tears frequently throughout the day, even when your eyes don't feel dry, to keep them lubricated. I'll write you a prescription for a preservative-free brand, as those are gentler on the eyes. Second, I strongly recommend wearing protective eyewear – safety glasses or goggles – at work to shield your eyes from dust and wind. Third, consider taking breaks during work to rest your eyes and re-lubricate them. Finally, for more significant relief, we could consider a prescription eye drop to help reduce inflammation and increase tear production. However, let’s start with the artificial tears and protective eyewear and see if that provides adequate relief. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds… okay. Eyedrops and glasses, huh? Preservative-free, you said? Gotta get back to work. How long 'til I feel better? And how much are the eyedrops?
DOCTOR: Yes, preservative-free. They are gentler and less likely to cause irritation, especially with frequent use. How long until you feel better… it varies. Some people notice improvement within a few days, others it may take a week or two of consistent use. It really depends on how severe the dryness is and how consistently you use the drops and wear the glasses. It's important to be consistent, even when your eyes feel better. As for the cost, the artificial tears I'm prescribing will likely be around \$15-\$20 depending on the pharmacy. It may be covered by some discount programs, it's always worth checking. I’m going to write you a prescription for the artificial tears and a note explaining the importance of protective eyewear at work. I'll also print out some information about dry eye syndrome for your reference. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that’s it. Just get me the prescription and I need to get goin’. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. Here you are. Remember to use the drops frequently and, most importantly, protect your eyes at work. If your symptoms don’t improve within a couple of weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I want to ensure we’re getting you the relief you need. Have a good day, and be careful out there.
