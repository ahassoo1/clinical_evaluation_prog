DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting ready for… surgery. The weight loss surgery. I think that's what it's for, anyway. My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey, no problem at all. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed with information, especially when preparing for something like surgery. We’ll take things slow and make sure we cover everything you need to know. So, you’re here for a pre-operative evaluation for weight loss surgery. Just to confirm, do you know which type of weight loss surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: To be honest, no, I don't. My wife did all the research and talking with the doctors about that part. She just told me I needed to come here for some check-ups and stuff before it could happen. I’m not very good with remembering names, let alone what kinds of surgeries there are. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Don’t apologize at all. It's good you're here, and we can certainly figure it out. I have access to your records here. Ah, yes. It looks like you’re scheduled for a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with Dr. Al-Fadhli. Does that name sound familiar?
PATIENT: Dr. Al-Fadhli… hmm. Maybe? I think my wife mentioned that name a few times. She said something about him being really good. Honestly, everything kind of blended together after a while. Lots of appointments, lots of talking... It’s a relief to be here now, and just talking to you about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. It can be a lot to process. Okay, well, we’ll focus on getting you prepped for the surgery. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any current medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but I don't take anything for it. And, uh… I get tired easily. But that's probably just from carrying the weight, right? I don’t think I have anything else. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, actually. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for people to put off seeing a doctor. High blood pressure is something we’ll definitely want to monitor closely before surgery. And fatigue can be a symptom of several things, including being overweight, so it’s good you mentioned that. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or has a doctor ever told you you were pre-diabetic?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. My wife would have told me if I had something like that, wouldn’t she? She’s very good about keeping track of things. But… I do drink a lot of sweet tea. Does that count for something? I know sugar isn't good for you.
DOCTOR: It's good your wife keeps track of things. And yes, drinking a lot of sweet tea can definitely contribute to health problems, including diabetes. We may want to check your blood sugar levels today, just to be safe. Okay, next question. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing soccer. That’s the only thing I can really remember. It healed up fine. Other than that… I don't think so. I’ve never really been sick sick, just the usual colds and stuff. Nothing that needed a hospital or anything. I'm trying to remember, but it's hard… everything feels so far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child. That's good to know. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any major health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mom… she had heart problems, I think. She was always tired and had to take medicine for it. And my dad… he had something with his sugar, maybe? Like, he couldn't eat too much sweet stuff. It's all a bit blurry, honestly. I wasn't very close to either of them, and my wife is the one who usually asks these questions. I feel bad I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly understandable. Knowing that your mother had heart problems and your father had issues with sugar is helpful. We can document those. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like the smell of it. My wife doesn’t either, thankfully. We both try to stay healthy… well, as healthy as we can right now, anyway. That’s why I’m here, right? To get healthier? I just wish I could remember everything better. It makes me feel… useless sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are not useless at all, Mr. Kochubey. You're here, and you're taking steps to improve your health, and that's what matters. Alright, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. Just a little bit, with dinner. Usually wine. My wife and I might share a glass or two on the weekends. Nothing crazy, I promise. We don't really go out much. I don't think it’s affected my health or anything. But like with everything else, I'm not really sure. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine on the weekends. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said before, I don't take anything for my blood pressure, even though my wife thinks I should. And I don’t really take anything else. Sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but that’s about it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. It makes me feel… uneasy, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. My wife always asks me that too, and I always say no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’m starting to feel bad that I’m not being more helpful. I really want to do this surgery, but I just can’t seem to remember things properly. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: You are being helpful, Mr. Kochubey. You're telling me what you know, and that's important. It’s perfectly normal to feel frustrated. Okay, one final question before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me your current height and weight, if you know them?
PATIENT: Well, I'm not very tall. I think I'm around… five foot? Maybe five foot one? And, um… I’m a bit heavy. I think it’s around 230 pounds? I haven't weighed myself in a while, so I might be off. My wife has a scale at home, I should ask her when we get back. I'm sorry. I wish I could just give you straight answers. It feels like I’m failing this test.
DOCTOR: You are not failing any test, Mr. Kochubey. You're doing just fine. Okay, so approximately five feet and 230 pounds. That’s helpful information. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to get this all sorted out and… be healthier. Please, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 158/92. That is a bit elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit fast. I hear some normal lung sounds. Your abdomen is soft, but I feel some fullness. No tenderness to the touch. Overall, it doesn’t seem like there's anything alarming, but these are findings we'll need to monitor. Okay, I’ve documented those findings. We’ll also need to draw some blood for routine labs, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if you’re a good candidate for surgery. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Labs… okay. That sounds… complicated. So, you need to take some blood? Is that going to hurt? I'm not good with needles. And what does "good candidate" mean? Am I… not a good candidate? I just want to be honest, I’m starting to get a little worried. I thought I was healthy enough to do this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel worried, Mr. Kochubey. Let’s take things one step at a time. Yes, we need to draw some blood. It’s a routine procedure, and it shouldn’t be too painful. You might feel a quick pinch, but it’s usually over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and they'll do their best to make you comfortable. As for “good candidate,” it simply means we need to make sure your body is healthy enough to undergo surgery and recover without complications. We’re looking at things like your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and overall organ health. It doesn’t mean you’re not a good candidate; it just means we need to gather more information first. It's standard procedure. Would you like me to explain which tests we're ordering and why?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would really help me feel better. I just… I don’t understand any of this medical stuff. You said something about sugar levels… is that bad? Should I stop drinking sweet tea? My wife is going to be upset if I tell her I haven’t stopped. She’s always telling me to drink water. I feel so lost.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel lost, Mr. Kochubey. It’s my job to explain things to you in a way that you understand. Yes, having high blood sugar levels can be a problem, especially before surgery. It can increase your risk of infection and slow down healing. The sweet tea does contribute to that, and your wife is right – drinking more water is a very good idea. It’s not about blaming you, it's about making healthy choices. We’re going to order a few tests to check these levels: Complete Blood Count : This tells us about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us detect infections or anemia. Metabolic Panel: This checks your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. Lipid Panel: This checks your cholesterol levels. These tests will give us a complete picture of your health. If your blood sugar levels are elevated, we may need to make some changes to your diet or prescribe medication before surgery. It’s all about minimizing risks and ensuring a successful outcome. Do you have any questions about these tests specifically?
PATIENT: Okay… CBC, metabolic panel, lipid panel. I’ll try to remember that. So, if my levels are bad… will I have to stop drinking sweet tea? I know it’s bad for me, but I really enjoy it. And what if I need medication? I don’t like taking pills. It just… makes me feel weird. I’m starting to think this whole surgery thing is too complicated. Maybe I shouldn’t do it.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Kochubey. It's a big decision, and it’s okay to have doubts. Let’s address your concerns one at a time. Regarding the sweet tea, if your blood sugar levels are elevated, we would likely recommend significantly reducing or eliminating it from your diet. It's not a punishment, it's about protecting your health and improving your chances of a successful surgery. We can work with a registered dietitian to help you find healthy alternatives. As for the medication, it’s true that no one likes taking pills. However, if medication is necessary, it would be to help stabilize your health before surgery. We would prescribe the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely for any side effects. And again, it's something we can discuss in detail – there may be alternative options available. I want to assure you that we wouldn’t move forward with surgery unless we felt it was safe for you. If your health isn't stable, we'll work together to get it there. It's not about forcing you to do something you're not comfortable with. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s get the lab results back. We can discuss all of your options once we have a clearer picture of your health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. Okay, labs first. Then we’ll talk. I can do that. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel… stupid. My wife always knows what to say, but I just get so flustered. What happens now? Do I go somewhere else for the labs? Or do you do them here? And… how long will it take to get the results? I'm afraid I have an appointment next week I'll need to cancel if this takes too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s my pleasure. And don’t worry, you’re not stupid at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We can draw the labs right here in the clinic. I’ll write you a lab order now. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. If you have an appointment next week, it might be wise to reschedule it just in case. We can also keep you updated if there are any delays. Here’s the lab order. Just take this to the lab technician down the hall. They'll draw the blood for you. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect when getting your blood drawn?
PATIENT: Okay, 3-5 business days. I'll reschedule my appointment. No, I think I’m okay. Just go down the hall to the lab tech, and they’ll do it. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little bit better now. Not completely, but… a little bit. I guess I'll go get this done then. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or anything I should avoid doing while waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad you're feeling a little better. The only thing I would recommend is to avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of the day. And try to drink plenty of water. Other than that, just try to relax and take things easy. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have the lab results back. We can discuss everything in detail then. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I'll go find the lab tech now. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Kochubey. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
