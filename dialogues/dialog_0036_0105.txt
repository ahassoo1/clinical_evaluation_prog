DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think it's a pre-check thing? Honestly, I don't remember all the details. My wife mostly handled setting everything up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative check-up. That makes sense. I see here you’re scheduled for bariatric surgery. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to pursue weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. It's… been a long time coming, I guess. I've always struggled with my weight, but it’s gotten harder and harder the last few years. It makes everything difficult, just… getting around, even. My wife worries a lot about my health, and… well, I want to be around for her and the kids for a long time. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. It takes courage to make a change like this, and it sounds like you have very good reasons for doing so. It’s perfectly alright if it’s hard to put into words. Before we go further, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to make sure everything is up to date and to assess any potential risks. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, sleep apnea, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a few years ago, but I don't remember if they gave me anything for it. And… my wife says I snore really loud, so maybe sleep apnea? But I've never actually been told I have it. I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly, to be honest. I'm sorry, I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common for people to not see a doctor as often as they should. We’ll get everything sorted out. So, high blood pressure in the past, potentially sleep apnea… noted. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. That needed a cast. And… oh! My wife says I was in the hospital when I was little with a really bad ear infection, but I don’t really remember that. That was a long time ago. Nothing since then, I think. No other surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, and a childhood ear infection. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity?
PATIENT: That's… a tough one. My dad, he had… heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young. My mom… she's got high blood pressure, I know that much. And… she’s a little overweight, too. My brother is pretty healthy, as far as I know. I don’t really know a lot about my grandparents’ health, honestly. We weren't very close. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and your mother's high blood pressure and weight is important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife gives me allergy medicine sometimes when the pollen is bad, but that’s just seasonal stuff. Never had a reaction to anything… food, medicine, anything. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin, sometimes. My wife buys it for me. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for a headache. That's it, I think. Nothing regularly, nothing prescribed by a doctor. I really don’t take much medication at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. We’re getting a good picture here. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well, I work in a retail store, so I'm on my feet a lot, but mostly just walking around. I don't really... exercise much, if that's what you mean. And I don't eat the best. Lots of takeout. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but it's hard. I work long hours, and it’s easier to just grab something quick. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally, like at a party or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, retail work, long hours, not a lot of exercise, and takeout frequently. It sounds like there's room for improvement, and that's perfectly alright. Many people struggle with those things. And you don't smoke and only drink occasionally, which is good. Now, one last thing before we proceed with the exam. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or any other symptoms that are bothering you at the moment?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I get a little short of breath when I’m walking up the stairs, but I just figured it was because I was out of shape. And yeah, I'm tired a lot, but I work long hours, so… I always figured it was just from that. No real pain, or anything major. Just kinda… worn down, all the time. I guess that's it. Nothing really alarming, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with stairs and fatigue. Those are things we’ll want to investigate further. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and assess your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated. Now, let’s take a look at your throat… open wide and say “Ah”… Throat looks clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen… Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. Finally, I’ll check your pulse and reflexes… Pulses are good and reflexes are normal. Overall, your exam findings are within normal limits, aside from the elevated blood pressure. We’ll want to monitor that closely. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us assess your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important indicators. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood. We’ll also need to do a basic EKG to check your heart rhythm. While we're waiting for the results, are you currently taking any supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, not really. My wife sometimes gets me those little vitamin gummies, like vitamin C when I'm feeling a cold coming on, but that's it. I don't take anything regularly, and I definitely don't take any herbal stuff. I stick to regular vitamins, and sometimes ibuprofen when I've got a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It's important to be aware of everything you're taking, even seemingly harmless vitamins. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, while we wait for the lab results, let’s discuss the next steps. Given your elevated blood pressure and your concerns about shortness of breath, I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist for a more comprehensive cardiac evaluation. They’ll be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. A cardiologist, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to make sure everything is okay before we go ahead with the surgery. So, yeah, schedule me an appointment with the cardiologist. Do you think it means something’s really wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is really wrong, Mr. Kochubey. It’s more of a precaution, given your blood pressure and the shortness of breath. We want to make sure your heart is healthy enough for surgery. It's always best to rule things out and get a complete picture before proceeding with a major procedure. A cardiologist is the specialist best equipped to do that. I'm sending the referral now. The office will call you to schedule an appointment. They usually get back within a few business days. We’ll also review your blood work results as soon as they come back and discuss them during your next appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. That makes sense. Just… a lot to take in, you know? So, I should just wait for the cardiologist to call and then we’ll see what the blood work says? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, anything I can do to… get healthier before the next appointment?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot to take in. And yes, you're right – wait for the cardiologist to call and we’ll review the blood work results together. In the meantime, there are a few things you can start doing to improve your health. First, try to incorporate some light exercise into your daily routine, like walking for 30 minutes most days of the week. Even a short walk can make a difference. Second, focus on eating a healthier diet. Try to reduce your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats, and increase your consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Finally, and this is important, try to manage your stress levels. Stress can contribute to high blood pressure and other health problems. Techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation can be helpful. I can provide you with some resources on these topics if you'd like. Remember, small changes can add up over time. Do you have any questions about any of these recommendations?
PATIENT: Okay, light exercise, healthier diet, manage stress. I can try. Easier said than done, but I'll try. Resources would be great, actually. Anything to help. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been really helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Here are those resources for you. Remember, we're a team in this. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you back once the cardiologist office schedules you and after we have your blood work results. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your help. Have a good day.
