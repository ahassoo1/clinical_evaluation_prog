DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it’s been really bad. Hurts a lot. It’s the same back that… the cancer was in, you know? It's been hurting more and more the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re experiencing increased back pain, and it's in the same area where you previously had cancer treatment. That’s certainly concerning, and we'll want to investigate that thoroughly. Just to clarify, when you say "a few weeks," can you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe the end of June? It was just a little ache at first, I thought it was just from working. But now… now it’s almost all the time. It’s worse when I bend over, or when I try to lift anything. Even coughing sometimes makes it really hurt. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the pain began gradually at the end of June, initially mild and associated with activity, and has progressively worsened over the past few weeks, now occurring almost constantly and exacerbated by bending, lifting, and even coughing. Is the pain localized to one specific spot, or does it radiate anywhere—down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: It’s mostly right across my lower back. Not so much shooting down my legs, no. Sometimes it feels… tight, like a muscle, all across there. But mostly just… a deep ache. It doesn’t really move around, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. A lot. I haven’t been sleeping good because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so localized lower back pain, constant, described as a deep ache, sometimes with a feeling of tightness, and it's interfering with your sleep. And to be clear, this is in the same area as your previous cancer treatment, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Same place. The doctors… they said it was all gone, after the treatment. But now this pain… I worry it’s back. I don’t want to go through all that again. Is it… is it possible it is back?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Ms. Meigs. It's natural to worry, given your history. While it is possible the pain is related to your previous cancer, there are many other potential causes of back pain, even after successful treatment. We need to investigate this thoroughly to determine the source of the pain. Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to ask you some further questions about your medical history, and then perform a physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Asking questions and looking at it… that’s better than just… worrying. I just want to know what’s going on. What kind of questions?
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's review your past medical history. I see here you’ve had treatment for… adenocarcinoma, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Adenocarcinoma. It was in my… well, it started in my stomach, but it spread to other places. They did surgery, and then… chemotherapy, and radiation. A lot of it. That was… a few years ago now. Maybe four? Five? I get all the dates mixed up sometimes. But the doctors said it was all clear after that. Until now.
DOCTOR: Four or five years ago. Okay. And were there any complications from the surgery or the chemotherapy and radiation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The chemo was really hard, I got very sick. And I was tired, all the time. After the surgery… it hurt a lot for a long time. But the doctors said that was normal. No… I don’t think there were any complications, exactly. Just… a lot of side effects. I lost a lot of weight. But they helped with that. I did have some trouble with infections a couple times, after the surgery, but they gave me medicine for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significant side effects from chemotherapy including nausea and fatigue, post-surgical pain, and a couple of infections that were treated with antibiotics. Have you had any other significant medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a couple times, but that’s it. My mother had arthritis, but I don't. I try to eat healthy, and I walk when I can. But with this back… it’s hard to walk now. I used to like gardening, but I haven’t been able to do that in weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a vitamin D. The doctor said my levels were low. And sometimes I take Tylenol for the pain, but it doesn't really help much anymore. That's about it. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D supplement and occasional Tylenol for pain. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take most pills. Like I said, I don’t take many, but I haven’t had any problems. I'm pretty lucky, usually. Except for this back…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll focus on your back. We'll check your range of motion, look for any tenderness, and assess your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's going on. It hurts when I sit for too long, and when I try to stand up straight. Maybe looking at it will tell you something.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please lie down on your back on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just try to relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little cold. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And thank you for letting me know about the temperature; I’ll see if I can adjust it. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe in and out deeply for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. It feels… normal. Like when the other doctors checked me before. My stomach sometimes feels bloated, but it doesn’t hurt when they push on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to focus on your back. This may be a little tender, so please let me know if you feel any pain. I'm going to start by feeling along your spine. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That's where it hurts the most. When you push on it. It’s a deep ache, like… a bruise, almost. It's been hurting more and more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as possible?
PATIENT: Oh… that hurts. I can't go very far. It pulls on my back. It's really tight. I used to be able to bend all the way over, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with forward flexion, and pain with movement. Now, can you bend backwards, as comfortably as possible?
PATIENT: Nope. That's worse. It feels like something’s going to snap. It's really stiff. I don't think I can do that. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion with extension, and pain. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal. Now, I need to review some imaging and lab results from your electronic health record. I see here you had a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis… and bloodwork from… six months ago. The CT scan was clear at that time, and your bloodwork was within normal limits. However, given the progression of your symptoms and the tenderness I found on examination, I think we need to order some updated imaging—an MRI of your lumbar spine—to get a better look at what’s going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? Will that show if the cancer is back? Is that what you think is happening? It's just… I was so relieved when the doctors said it was all gone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs. An MRI will give us a much more detailed picture of your spine—the bones, muscles, nerves, and any potential abnormalities. It's the best way to determine the source of your pain. While it's possible the pain could be related to a recurrence of the cancer, it's important to remember that there are many other potential causes of back pain—muscle strain, nerve compression, arthritis, for example. We need to rule those out first. I'm not saying it is cancer, but we need to investigate thoroughly to get an accurate diagnosis. And I will be ordering a consult with radiology to make sure the imaging is interpreted correctly. In the meantime, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant and some stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort, and I will also give you some instructions on how to care for your back at home. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Muscle relaxant and pain meds… and the MRI. That’s good. I just want to know what’s going on. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s just… scary. What kind of instructions for my back? Should I be resting? Or trying to move around? I always get confused about that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. As for your back, it's important to maintain some activity, but avoid any movements that exacerbate your pain. Gentle stretching and walking are good, but avoid lifting anything heavy, bending repeatedly, or twisting. I’ll give you a handout with specific exercises and tips on proper posture and body mechanics. I'm also going to write you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 10mg, take one tablet at bedtime, and for oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325mg, take one tablet every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. And I will schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible—ideally within the next few days. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Soodeen. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you listening. I'll call if I have questions. And I'll wait for a call about the MRI.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. My staff will contact you to schedule the MRI. We’ll get this sorted out. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon.
