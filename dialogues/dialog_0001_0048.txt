DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, have a seat. Look, I’m Audel Pehrson, doctor here. I got a full waiting room, so let's try and be quick, okay?
PATIENT: Quick is good. Always been a man who appreciates efficiency. My wife, she… well, she doesn't. Always dawdling. So, confusion, you say? Yes. It comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s just… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Disconcerting. Right. And how long has this "disconcerting" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… hmm. Probably six, maybe seven months ago now. It's hard to pinpoint, exactly. Things blur when you get to be my age, you know? But around the time the rainy season really started last year, I'd say. It’s not like I forget everything, mind you. I remember perfectly where I put my tools, and I can still tell you the best way to lay a herringbone pattern. It's just… moments. Like a gap in the thinking.
DOCTOR: Herringbone patterns… okay. And these "moments"... can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me see. Last month, I was at the market, buying fish for my wife’s prahok curry—she makes a very particular curry, you understand—and I couldn't remember where I parked the motorbike. Just… blank. I walked around for a good fifteen minutes, asking everyone, before finally finding it tucked away near the fruit stalls. Embarrassing, really. People were staring. I always park in the same spot. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, memory lapses... Alright. And has anything changed around the time these started?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… not really. My wife and I still eat the same things, go to the market like always. The construction business has been slow, a bit… fewer big jobs, more small repairs. But that’s just the economy, isn't it? Nothing major, no. Except… young Sophy, my grandson, he moved to Phnom Penh for university. That was about the same time, I think. He always kept me sharp, asking about my work, wanting to learn the trade. It’s quieter around the house now. Though I don’t see how that would cause confusion. It’s just… quieter.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Not falling, mind you, just… unsteady on my feet. And I’ve been more tired than usual. My wife keeps saying I nap too much. She says I used to be a man of action, always busy. Though she doesn’t understand. A man needs his rest, especially when he’s been working with stone all his life. But no, nothing else… really. Just the confusion, the tiredness, and the occasional wobble. And, of course, missing young Sophy. But that's just… sadness. Not a symptom, surely?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not really. I wear glasses, have for years, ever since I started doing the fine tile work. The small details, you understand. But I get them checked regularly. Old man's eyes, you know. But my vision's been steady. I can still see a crooked tile a mile away. It's a gift, really. An eye for detail. Important in my line of work. No changes there. Perfectly clear, as far as I can tell. Though maybe a little… dimmer, now that I think about it. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick check, just to be sure. It won’t take long. I need you to follow my finger with your eyes, okay?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? Fine. As long as it’s quick. I have things to do, you know. Tile doesn't lay itself. But yes, I can follow your finger. Just try not to wave it around too much. Makes me dizzy. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, follow along... Good. Now look straight ahead... and tell me what year it is.
PATIENT: What year it is? Honestly, doctor, is this necessary? It’s… 2025. Of course it's 2025. Everyone knows that. Though, between you and me, sometimes the years just… blur together. But yes. 2025. Is something wrong? You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me the names of the last three presidents of the United States?
PATIENT: Presidents? Now you're testing me. I’m a tile setter, not a politician. Honestly, doctor, this seems a bit… irrelevant. I haven’t paid much attention to… presidents. The last one… hmm. Trump, wasn’t it? Before him… Obama, I think? And before that… oh dear. This is ridiculous. I know how to lay a perfect mosaic, but I can’t recall presidents? It’s a waste of my time, and yours. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll skip that part. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just… old age, maybe. Listen, I'm going to order a basic blood test, just to rule out anything simple. Vitamin deficiency, that sort of thing. And I'll send you to a neurologist, just for a proper evaluation. They’re the experts in this sort of thing. It's probably nothing serious, but it's better to be safe. Here’s a requisition form. Schedule the blood work, then call this number for the neurology appointment. Don't worry too much about it, okay?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly. All this fuss over a little confusion? I can still work, I can still think. But… fine. A blood test. And a neurologist. My wife will be pleased, I suppose. She always worries. This is a lot of paperwork. And a specialist? Honestly, doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. But… alright. I'll do it. Just to keep her happy. But if they start asking me about presidents again, I’m walking out. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, no presidents. Just get the tests done. Next! Stop.
