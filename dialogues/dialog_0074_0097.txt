DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because, frankly, my husband insists. He’s become rather preoccupied with… end-of-life arrangements. Utterly unnecessary, if you ask me, but he’s quite insistent on these… forms. An Advance Directive, he called it. Or a POLST. Something of that nature. I simply want the paperwork completed so he will cease his worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of you to come in to address your husband’s concerns, Marija. And it's good he’s thinking proactively about these important matters. We can certainly help with completing those forms – an Advance Directive and a POLST form, as you mentioned. To ensure we address everything appropriately, let’s start with a bit of background. I'd like to get a sense of your overall health. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well, when absolutely necessary. I am a healthy woman, Doctor. I do not seek doctors unless there is a pressing issue. My general practitioner in the city… I saw her perhaps three years ago for a routine check-up. Before that… I cannot recall precisely. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, a good diet, and I am quite active. I assure you, I am not one to complain of every little ache and pain. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Marija. It's good you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. And I appreciate your directness. While a proactive approach is wonderful, it's also important to have a baseline understanding of your health, even when you’re feeling well. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I have no such… problems. My husband keeps offering me these supplements, constantly claiming I am “low” in something or other, but I refuse them. I eat well, I exercise, and I get plenty of rest. I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. Though, I do occasionally suffer from a touch of… indigestion. But that is hardly a condition, Doctor. It's simply a result of enjoying good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. And it’s perfectly reasonable to have occasional indigestion, especially with a good appetite! We can certainly discuss that further if it becomes bothersome. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have never required hospitalization, and I have certainly never undergone any surgical procedures. I find the very thought… unsettling. My body is perfectly functional, thank you very much. I maintain an active lifestyle and, as I’ve said, prioritize my well-being. Surgeries are for… weaker constitutions, if you ask me. I have always been quite resilient.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Marija. It’s wonderful that you’ve maintained such good health throughout your life. Let’s shift gears slightly. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my mother suffered from… well, she was prone to complaining. She always spoke of “nerves” and a weak constitution. She spent a great deal of time with doctors, but I always suspected it was simply a lack of fortitude. My father was… remarkably healthy, though he did succumb to a rather sudden heart attack in his later years. Quite shocking, really. He was a strong man, always active. I suppose it could have been… the stress of work. He was a businessman, you see. A very demanding profession. Otherwise, I don't recall any significant… ailments plaguing my family. They were generally a stoic bunch.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful to know. A family history of heart issues is good information to have, even if it was sudden. Now, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: As I said before, I take no medications. Absolutely none. My husband keeps attempting to foist these… vitamins and herbal remedies upon me, claiming I am deficient in something or other, but I firmly refuse. I obtain all the necessary nutrients from a balanced diet, and I find the thought of relying on artificial substances… distasteful. I might occasionally take a simple pain reliever for a headache, but that is hardly a regular occurrence. I prefer to rest and drink plenty of water, and the headache usually resolves itself. I assure you, Doctor, I am a firm believer in natural remedies.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Marija. It's good to be mindful of what you put into your body. So, just to confirm, you don’t currently take any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Precisely. None whatsoever. My husband continues to nag, of course. He is quite insistent that I am “risking my health” by refusing his concoctions, but I remain steadfast. I maintain a perfectly adequate diet and lifestyle, and I find the thought of relying on artificial substances… unnecessary. I assure you, Doctor, I am in excellent health. Now, shall we proceed with these… forms? I must admit, I am growing rather impatient. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand your impatience. Before we move on to the forms, I'd like to quickly perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your current health status. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I have already stated quite clearly that I am in excellent health. I do not require a physical examination. I came here for paperwork, not a medical assessment. My husband may be prone to unnecessary anxieties, but I assure you, I am perfectly capable of assessing my own well-being. I fail to see the purpose of such a… frivolous exercise. Now, if you would simply provide me with the forms, I would be most grateful. My time is, as I've mentioned, quite valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Marija. And I apologize if I’ve caused any offense. It’s not my intention to suggest you’re not capable of assessing your own well-being. However, as part of completing these Advance Directive and POLST forms responsibly, it’s standard practice to have a basic understanding of your current health status. It helps ensure the forms accurately reflect your wishes and preferences. It truly won't take long – just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears and throat. It's simply a precaution, and it allows me to better understand your overall health context. Think of it as a formality to ensure the paperwork is as comprehensive and accurate as possible. Would you reconsider?
PATIENT: Doctor, you are remarkably persistent. And frankly, rather… condescending. I have explained, repeatedly, that I am in excellent health. I fail to see how listening to my heartbeat or examining my throat will alter that fact. However… if it is absolutely essential for the completion of these forms, and if it will finally silence my husband’s anxieties… very well. But I assure you, it is a complete waste of my time. And I expect a swift and efficient examination. I have other commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marija. I appreciate your willingness to allow me to perform a quick exam. I assure you, it will be as swift and efficient as possible. If you’ll please have a seat on the table, we can begin. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But please be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And do hurry. I have a luncheon appointment with several… important colleagues. This entire ordeal is already proving rather… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's within a normal range. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a rigorous exercise regime, and my lungs are perfectly capable. I have never experienced any shortness of breath, and the very notion of chest pain is… preposterous. As I’ve stated repeatedly, I am in excellent health. Now, are we nearing the conclusion of this… assessment? I find the sterile environment rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or unusual sounds. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can see perfectly well. I have no vision problems. I read extensively, you see. Several novels a week, in fact. And I require no corrective lenses. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? I fail to see the purpose of these… elementary examinations. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear as well. Everything appears normal so far. Say "Ah." Your throat looks clear. No redness or swelling. Okay, Marija. Everything appears normal based on this quick examination. Your heart and lungs sound good, your ears and throat look clear, and your vision appears normal.
PATIENT: Precisely. As I have been attempting to convey since my arrival. Now, shall we finally proceed with these forms? I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I trust you have all the necessary information to complete them efficiently? I have no desire to spend any further time in this… clinical setting. Now, Doctor, if you would be so kind… the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand your eagerness to leave. I have everything I need. These forms are designed to document your wishes regarding your future medical care, should you become unable to speak for yourself. We’ll go through them section by section. Please read each section carefully, and don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. We’ll start with naming your healthcare proxy – the person you trust to make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to do so. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: Naturally. My husband, Farid. He is… meticulous, and possesses a rather… forceful personality. He will ensure everything is handled… appropriately. Though I doubt he will actually need to make any decisions. I fully intend to remain in perfect health for the foreseeable future. Now, shall we simply complete the form and be done with it? I have a rather important luncheon with several colleagues… a matter of significant professional importance. This paperwork feels… unnecessarily morbid.
DOCTOR: Very good. We’ll note Farid as your healthcare proxy. The next section concerns your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, such as CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. It asks you to indicate whether you would want those treatments in certain situations. Would you like me to explain the options in more detail, or would you prefer to simply indicate your preferences?
PATIENT: Explain. Briefly. I have absolutely no desire to delve into the intricacies of… life support systems. I simply want the form completed expeditiously. The thought of discussing such… unpleasant scenarios is rather distasteful. Just outline the options, and I will indicate my preferences. But please, be concise. My time is valuable, Doctor. And I have a rather… delicate constitution. I prefer not to dwell on matters of illness or mortality.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Essentially, this section asks you to consider what level of medical intervention you would want if you were facing a life-threatening illness and unable to communicate your wishes. The first option is "Full Treatment," meaning you would want all possible life-sustaining measures attempted, regardless of your prognosis. The second option is "Selective Treatment," meaning you would want some life-sustaining measures, but not all. For example, you might want CPR but not mechanical ventilation. And the third option is "Comfort Care Only," meaning you would want only measures to relieve pain and suffering, without attempting to prolong your life. Do you have any questions about these options, or would you like me to elaborate further?
PATIENT: Elaborate? No. It is perfectly clear. Farid handles all such matters. He is… decisive. Simply mark "Full Treatment." I have no desire to limit any potential life-saving measures. Though, I sincerely doubt such a scenario will ever arise. Now, shall we proceed to the next section of this… document? This entire process is rather… unsettling. I have a luncheon appointment, you see. And I refuse to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I've marked "Full Treatment" for you. This form, the POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a bit different. It's a medical order that specifies your wishes regarding certain treatments, such as CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Unlike the Advance Directive, which is a general statement of your preferences, the POLST is a specific order that your healthcare providers must follow. The first section concerns CPR. Would you like me to explain the options?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. Is this truly necessary? My husband insists on this… level of detail. Very well. Explain. But please, be brief. I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I find the entire concept of discussing resuscitation procedures… distasteful. Simply outline the options, and I will indicate my preferences. But do hurry. I have a reputation to uphold, and tardiness is simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Regarding CPR, there are two main options. The first is "Full Code," meaning that all possible measures will be taken to attempt to resuscitate you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. This includes chest compressions, medications, and intubation. The second option is "Do Not Resuscitate," or DNR. This means that no measures will be taken to attempt to resuscitate you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Comfort care will be provided, but no life-sustaining measures will be attempted. Do you have any questions about these options, or would you like me to elaborate further?
PATIENT: Elaborate? No. It is… perfectly clear. Though, frankly, the entire concept is rather morbid. My husband is… overly cautious, you see. Very well. Mark "Full Code." I refuse to limit any potential life-saving measures. Though, I sincerely doubt such a scenario will ever arise. Now, shall we proceed to the next section of this… document? I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I simply cannot afford to be late. My colleagues are… quite important. Now, Doctor, if you would be so kind… the next section. And please, be expeditious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I’ve marked "Full Code" for you. This section concerns whether you would want artificial nutrition and hydration – feeding and fluids provided through a tube – if you were unable to eat or drink on your own. There are a few options here as well… Would you like me to explain those options now, or would you prefer to complete the form later?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. Must we delve into such… unpleasant details? My husband is obsessed with this level of… specificity. Very well. Explain. But please, be concise. I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I simply refuse to be subjected to any further… morbidity. Now, proceed. But do hurry. My reputation is at stake, and tardiness is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Regarding artificial nutrition and hydration, there are three main options. The first is "Full Assistance," meaning you would want artificial nutrition and hydration provided if you were unable to eat or drink on your own. The second option is "Selective Assistance," meaning you would want artificial nutrition and hydration provided only for a limited time, or only if you met certain criteria. And the third option is "None," meaning you would not want artificial nutrition and hydration provided under any circumstances. Do you have any questions about these options, or would you like me to elaborate further?
PATIENT: Elaborate? No. It is… perfectly clear. My husband is overly cautious, you see. Very well. Mark "Full Assistance." I refuse to limit any potential life-sustaining measures. Though, I sincerely doubt such a scenario will ever arise. Now, shall we proceed to the final section of this… document? I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I simply cannot afford to be late. My colleagues are… quite important. Now, Doctor, if you would be so kind… the final section. And please, be expeditious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I’ve marked “Full Assistance” for you. This final section is an opportunity to share your overall goals of care and any specific preferences you have for end-of-life care, such as where you would like to receive care and who you would like to be present. It's a more open-ended section, and you can simply write whatever you feel is important. Would you like to take a moment to write something here, or would you prefer to leave it blank?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. Must we delve into such… morbid details? My husband is obsessed with this level of… specificity. Very well. Leave it blank. I have no desire to dwell on such… unpleasant scenarios. My husband will handle everything. He is… decisive. Now, is this document finally complete? I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I simply cannot afford to be late. My colleagues are… quite important. Now, if you would be so kind… the completed forms.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here are the completed forms. Please review them one final time to ensure everything is accurate. And remember, you can always change your mind and update these forms in the future. I'll make a copy for your records and place the originals in your medical chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. This is… sufficient. I have no desire to dwell on such… unpleasant scenarios. Now, if you would excuse me… I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I simply cannot afford to be late. My colleagues are… quite important. Thank you for your… assistance. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you a pleasant luncheon and a wonderful day. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
