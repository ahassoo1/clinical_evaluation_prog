DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Well, my legs… my shins, they’ve got these… bumps. Red ones. And they hurt. Not all the time, but enough to bother me, you know? Especially after I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Red, bumpy shins that are painful, particularly after being on your feet. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started a few months ago, I guess. Maybe… around May? They weren’t that bad at first, just a little itchy. But they’ve gotten bigger and more painful lately. I thought maybe bug bites, but they haven’t gone away. And they don’t really look like bug bites, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That's good information. It's helpful that they started as itchy and have progressed. And you're right to question bug bites if they haven't resolved. Are the bumps on both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both legs, Doc. Mostly on the front of my shins. They seem kinda even on both sides, though. Not more on one than the other, not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My wife, she noticed them too, and she said the same thing. She's got a good eye for that kinda stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, good – that they are symmetrical is useful information. And your wife noticing is helpful! Do you recall any specific activity or event that seemed to make them worse or start them?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I did a lot of heavy lifting at work around the time I first noticed them. We were unloading a big shipment of… well, I don’t even remember what it was. Boxes, mostly. Lots and lots of boxes. And I was on my feet all day. Could be that, huh?
DOCTOR: That sounds plausible. Heavy lifting and prolonged standing can certainly contribute to various leg issues. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bumps – any swelling, warmth, or changes in the skin texture?
PATIENT: No, no swelling, Doc. And they don't feel warmer than the rest of my leg. The skin… it doesn’t feel different, really. Just bumpy and red and kinda sore to the touch. They don’t itch much anymore, mostly just the soreness. Sometimes, if I rub my pants against them, it’ll bother them a bit. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No swelling or warmth is reassuring. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doc. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think! I've got a little high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day. Been on it for years. Other than that… nope. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing major. My wife keeps me in line, makes sure I eat right, you know? She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. Managing your blood pressure is excellent. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s Lisinopril, I think. 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, must be ten years now. Doctor told me it's important to keep taking it, even if I feel okay. And I do, mostly. Except sometimes I forget, but my wife reminds me! She’s got a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. My wife always asks when I try something new, but I always tell her, “Nope, no allergies!” She worries a lot, that one. But it’s good, I guess. Keeps me safe.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. Oh! Years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. But that was… oh, goodness, must be fifty years ago now! Other than that, nope. No hospital stays, no surgery. Just the appendix. A long time ago. And I’ve been fine ever since, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed a long time ago. And no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, skin issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: My mama… she had high blood pressure too, just like me. And my papa, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. But other than that… not really. My sister, she’s healthy as a horse. Always been strong. No skin problems that I know of, not in my family. We’re a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Mostly just the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Not at all. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Don’t like the smell of ‘em. And I haven’t had a drink in… oh, goodness, probably thirty years. Used to have a beer every now and then, but my wife convinced me to stop. Said it wasn’t good for my health, and she was right. And drugs… never touched ‘em, never even wanted to. A simple life is a good life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information, Mr. Aluia. That was very helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at your legs. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doc. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. These old bones ain't as spry as they used to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bumps you were describing. They're located on the front of your shins, and they are tender to the touch. I don’t feel any warmth or swelling, which is good. Based on what you've told me, and from my examination, it appears you may have shin splints with some accompanying inflammation. It’s possible that the heavy lifting you did a few months ago aggravated the muscles in your shins, leading to these symptoms. Do you experience any pain when you point your toes upwards, like you’re trying to stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That kinda hurts. Not bad, but… yeah, definitely feels it. It's more of a stretching pain, I guess? Like somethin's pullin' on the muscle. Especially the left one, I think. Does that make sense? I haven’t really thought about it before, just figured it was from bein’ on my feet too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. The pain with pointing your toes upward is consistent with muscle strain. It sounds like the muscle and tendons in your shins are indeed inflamed. It's quite common, especially with increased activity or heavy lifting. To be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple blood test, just to check your inflammatory markers and rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doc. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Blood test… alright. No problem. As long as it helps figure out what’s goin’ on. I trust your judgment. Just let me know where to go and what I need to do. And how long it'll take to get the results? I’d like to get back to work as soon as I can, but I don’t wanna push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. Our lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will assist you. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible. Avoid heavy lifting and prolonged standing. You can also try applying ice packs to your shins for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help reduce pain and inflammation. I'll also give you a written handout with these instructions. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more tailored treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds great, Doc. Rest, ice, and pain relievers… I can do that. I'm just glad we're tryin' to figure it out. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me. A handout would be good, just so I don't forget anythin'. And yeah, look forward to the follow-up appointment. Thank you again. I’ll go find the nurse now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be right with you. She’ll handle the blood work and answer any questions you might have. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Aluia. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. You too.
