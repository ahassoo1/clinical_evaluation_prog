DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… going to the bathroom a lot. More often than usual, certainly. It’s… frequent, I suppose is the best way to put it. I’m not sure what’s causing it, and it’s becoming quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things with me; it’s why I’m here. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive, and we'll work to find out what's going on. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… the urge comes on quite often. Throughout the day, and… sometimes at night, which is the bothersome part. I don’t think I’m drinking excessively much water, but maybe I am? It’s difficult to say, truthfully. My memory hasn’t been the best lately. I just know it’s more frequent than it used to be. And… it doesn’t seem to be related to anything specific, if that makes sense. I don’t notice it happening more after drinking coffee or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. MacVittie. It's helpful to know it's not painful and doesn’t appear to be linked to specific beverages. The nighttime frequency is particularly relevant. When you say your memory hasn’t been the best lately, could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s just little things, mostly. Forgetting where I put my keys, or… the name of an acquaintance. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just… gaps, here and there. It’s been getting worse gradually, over the past few months, perhaps? It makes it difficult to pinpoint when things started changing, to be honest. It's frustrating, and I worry about it, naturally. I suppose it’s just… a general fuzziness, if that makes sense. I don't recall any head injuries or anything like that, though.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. MacVittie. Gradual changes in memory, even seemingly minor ones, are worth investigating, especially in conjunction with the urinary frequency. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit difficult. I was divorced a few years back, and… well, things were a bit chaotic then. I’m not sure I kept track of everything as well as I should have. I don’t believe I have any major health problems, to my knowledge. No diabetes or anything like that. I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… quite some time, I’m afraid. I’m not insured, so I tend to avoid it if I can. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing significant. And… I don’t recall any surgeries. I really wish I was better at remembering these things! Is this making it difficult for you, Doctor? I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. MacVittie. It’s perfectly alright. Many patients haven’t had regular medical care, and recalling details can be challenging. We’ll do our best to work with what we have. Given the recent changes and the lack of a clear medical history, let’s move on to some questions about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of diabetes, kidney problems, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My mother… she had some heart problems later in life, I believe. And my father… he struggled with high blood pressure. I don’t recall anything about kidney problems or… neurological conditions, no. My maternal grandmother had arthritis, quite severely, but that’s all I can really think of, truthfully. They’re both… gone now, so it’s difficult to ask, naturally. And I wasn’t particularly close to either of them, to be honest. I apologize again for my lack of detail, Doctor. It’s… frustrating for me as well. Perhaps this isn’t very helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. MacVittie. Knowing about your parents' heart condition and high blood pressure is useful information. Now, let's discuss your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, honestly. I walk most days, and I eat a fairly balanced diet. I work as a concierge, so I’m on my feet quite a bit. I pride myself on being healthy, which is why this whole situation is so unsettling. It feels… out of character, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. MacVittie. Maintaining an active lifestyle and a healthy diet is excellent. Finally, before we proceed with a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take any medications at all. I tried a multivitamin for a while, a few years ago, but I stopped taking it. I prefer to get my nutrients from food, if possible. I don’t like taking pills, and I’m wary of potential side effects. I suppose that’s all. Is a physical examination necessary, Doctor? I’m a little anxious about it, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor, and I'm not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. MacVittie. A physical examination will help me to gather more information and determine the possible cause of your symptoms. I understand your anxiety, and I will explain everything as we go along, and we can take things at your pace. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll gently palpate your abdomen, and lastly, I'll perform a basic neurological examination, checking your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright, I suppose. As long as you explain everything, that would be very reassuring. I appreciate you being so patient with me, Doctor. I really am anxious, and I apologize if I seem difficult. It's just… all of this is a little overwhelming. Perhaps if you explain each step before you do it? That would make me feel much more comfortable. And… please don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MacVittie. I completely understand. I will explain each step before I perform it, and please, do not hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Your comfort is my priority. Let’s start with your vital signs. I'm going to wrap a cuff around your upper arm to measure your blood pressure. It will tighten briefly, and then release. This will give us a baseline reading of your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s alright. It feels… snug. A little tight, perhaps, but not painful. I’m a little nervous about the squeezing, but I’m trying to relax. Is there anything I should be doing while you’re taking the reading? Breathing a certain way, perhaps? I always worry about doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. It is a little snug, and it will squeeze briefly. You are doing perfectly fine. All you need to do is sit still and relax your arm. Breathe normally – don't hold your breath. I’m getting a reading of 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. Now, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’m going to place it on your chest and back to listen for any unusual sounds. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Listening to my heart and lungs sounds… sensible. It feels a little cold, perhaps? But I suppose it needs to be cold to work properly. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Yes, the stethoscope is cold. It’s necessary for a good seal. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This means I'll be feeling your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll start lightly, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… gently palpating my abdomen. That sounds… less pleasant, if I’m honest. But I understand it’s necessary. Just let me know if you feel anything… unusual. I’m a little sensitive, as I mentioned. And… it's been a little upset lately, if that makes a difference. Not painful, just… unsettled. Please be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Ms. MacVittie. And it's helpful to know your abdomen has been unsettled. I'm feeling some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no significant masses or rigidity. It's not sharp pain, is it?
PATIENT: No, not sharp. It's more of a… dull ache, really. Intermittent. It comes and goes. It’s… difficult to describe. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, if that makes a difference. It’s just… uncomfortable. Especially when I have to… go to the bathroom. It's not debilitating, just… annoying. And a little worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Ms. MacVittie. Intermittent dull ache is helpful information. Now, I'd like to perform a basic neurological examination. This involves checking your reflexes, coordination, and some simple cognitive function. I'll start with your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees and ankles with this reflex hammer. It may cause a slight jerk, but it shouldn't be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay… checking my reflexes. A reflex hammer. That sounds… a little alarming, if I’m honest. But I suppose it’s necessary. A slight jerk, you say? As long as it’s not too forceful. I worry about… reactions. Sometimes I’m a little slow to respond to things. Is that something you’ll be testing? I apologize for being so anxious, Doctor. This is all a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. MacVittie. I understand. And yes, I will be observing your responses, but it’s not a formal test. I'm simply checking for basic reflex function. Good. You have a normal patellar reflex. Now, let's check the other side. And that one is normal as well. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Follow your finger… without moving my head. Is this… satisfactory, Doctor? I worry about my eye muscles. They sometimes feel a little tired. I apologize for being such a difficult patient.
DOCTOR: You're not difficult at all, Ms. MacVittie. You're simply concerned, which is perfectly understandable. And your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your cognitive function. Just answer to the best of your ability. First, what is today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. Let me see… It’s… August. I believe it's the 2nd… yes, August 2nd. Is that correct? I’m so sorry. I’m having trouble with dates lately. It’s… a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. MacVittie. August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: Oh… my name? It’s… Keoni. Keoni MacVittie. Is that correct? It feels… distant, honestly. Like I'm remembering someone else's name. I apologize. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. MacVittie. Keoni MacVittie. Okay. Based on the physical examination and your responses, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your elevated blood pressure, tenderness in your lower abdomen, and some difficulties with recent recall warrant further investigation. I recommend we start with a urine analysis to rule out any infection or other abnormalities. I also recommend a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. Finally, given your recent memory concerns, I suggest we schedule a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist. Would you be open to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, I’m happy to proceed. Urine analysis, blood count, and a cognitive assessment… I just want to understand what’s happening. I’m a little worried about the cost, though. I’m not insured, as I mentioned. Is there… any way to reduce the cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ms. MacVittie. We can explore some options. Our clinic has a financial assistance program for uninsured patients, and we can also see if there are any local resources that offer discounted testing. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first and schedule the others later if needed. The urine analysis and complete blood count are relatively inexpensive and will give us a good starting point. I'll write you a requisition for those tests. You can take it to the lab across the street. They will draw your blood and send the results to me. As for the cognitive assessment, I will refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in memory disorders. I'll provide you with her contact information. She can discuss the cost and insurance options with you directly. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very acceptable, Doctor. Financial assistance, prioritizing tests, and a referral to Dr. Vance… I appreciate you being so understanding and helpful. A requisition for the urine analysis and blood work… and Dr. Vance's contact information. I feel… a little relieved, honestly. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or… any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. For now, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids and try to get adequate rest. Avoid any unnecessary stress, and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regarding questions, just one more: have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Oh… changes in my vision? Let me see… I wear glasses, as you can see, but I haven't had them updated in… quite some time. I suppose things have been a little blurry lately, but I assumed it was just my prescription. It's difficult to say, honestly. Perhaps a little more strain? Nothing drastic, though. Is that… concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. MacVittie. Given your unchanged prescription and reported increased blurriness, it would be prudent to schedule an eye exam as well. We can add that to the list. It’s important to rule out any vision problems that could be contributing to your symptoms. To summarize: we’re ordering a urine analysis and complete blood count, referring you to Dr. Vance for a cognitive assessment, and recommending an eye exam. I will provide you with the necessary paperwork and contact information for each. I'll follow up with you once I receive the results of the initial tests. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. Paperwork for the tests and contact information… that’s perfect. Thank you again for your help. I feel… a little better, knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s happening. I think that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I’m glad I could help. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day.
