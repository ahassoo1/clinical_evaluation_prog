DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Though I must say, this waiting room is…sparse. But never mind that. It’s my foot, you see. A dreadful sore. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it just won’t heal. I’ve tried everything my granddaughter suggested, and she’s a sensible girl, usually. But clearly, she’s not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! At least six, I’d wager. Maybe seven. Time just…slips away when you’re older, you know. It started as a little cut, barely noticeable, really. I probably got it walking barefoot in the garden. I do enjoy tending my hibiscus. But then it just…worsened. And it hurts, Doctor. A good, stinging sort of hurt. Not like a broken bone, thankfully, but persistent. It keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: Hibiscus, alright. And you say it's a stinging pain?
PATIENT: Yes, stinging. Like little needles poking at it, constantly. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. And it's not just the pain, it’s…well, it’s unsightly, Doctor. I haven’t worn sandals all summer, which is simply dreadful. A woman likes to keep up appearances, you know. And it seems to be…discharging something. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It's a pale yellow colour, if that matters. Though I’m not sure what does matter these days. People just don’t seem to care about proper etiquette anymore.
DOCTOR: Pale yellow discharge...Right. And has this pain interfered with your ability to walk normally?
PATIENT: Interfered? Heavens, yes! I shuffle more than walk these days. It's quite undignified. I used to be quite a gardener, as I mentioned, but now I have to be very careful where I step. And the distance! I can’t go for my morning walks with my granddaughter anymore. She worries about me, you know. Constantly fussing. "Grandma, be careful! Grandma, sit down!" It's exhausting. And it’s not just the walking, it's standing, even sitting for too long gets uncomfortable. It just throbs, Doctor. A constant, irritating throb. I’ve always been a very active woman, and this has really… slowed me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned your granddaughter has been offering suggestions. What specifically has she recommended?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts of things, bless her heart. Mostly things she reads on the internet, you know how young people are. She’s got me soaking my foot in Epsom salts, which is messy and doesn’t do a bit of good. Then there was that tea tree oil. Smelled dreadful, and irritated the skin around the sore, making things even worse. She’s also been going on about “proper circulation” and making me wear those support stockings. They’re terribly uncomfortable and cut off my air supply. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate her concern, but she clearly isn’t a medical professional. I keep telling her that. A good poultice is what I need, probably, but I’m not even sure what in anymore. Everything is so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Tea tree oil...a poor choice. Now, let's get a look at this foot. Please, have a seat on the examination table and remove your shoe and sock. I need to assess the wound directly. And try not to anticipate discomfort. It will be a quick examination.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at it? After all that questioning? Honestly, Doctor. Very well. There. Be careful, it's rather tender. And please don't dawdle. I have a luncheon date with the garden club later. We’re discussing the proper arrangement of bougainvillea. Very important work, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this is…concerning. There is significant inflammation and some purulent drainage present. The wound bed appears rather deep. Ms. Cannington, I suspect you may have a developing foot ulcer, potentially complicated by infection. Your circulation doesn't appear strong, either. Do you have any history of diabetes or peripheral vascular disease?
PATIENT: Oh, finally someone is being direct. Diabetes? Well, my doctor – the previous one, before Dr. Blim, of course – mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high a few years back. “Watch your diet,” he said. “Cut back on the mangoes.” Mangoes are my favourite! I didn’t pay much attention, frankly. I thought it was just old age. And peripheral…what did you call it? Something about blood vessels? I honestly don't recall. I've had a very full life, Doctor. I don’t keep track of every little ailment. But infection, you say? That sounds dreadful. Is it contagious? I certainly don't want to give anything to my garden club ladies! They are very particular about hygiene, you know.
DOCTOR: A history of elevated blood sugar… Alright. And no, Ms. Cannington, it's not contagious. However, an infected foot ulcer can become serious very quickly, particularly with compromised circulation. We need to determine the extent of the infection and assess your overall health. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a blood sugar test – and I'll also need to send a sample of the drainage to the lab for culture and sensitivity. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. I would also like to order an ABI, an Ankle-Brachial Index test, to measure your circulation.
PATIENT: Tests, tests, and more tests! Honestly, Doctor, it's exhausting just thinking about it. Blood work, cultures, indexes… Is there no end to it? I suppose I have no choice. Though I do hope it doesn't take too long. My luncheon is at one o’clock, and I promised to bring my prize-winning hibiscus cutting. Though now, with this sore, I'm not sure I can even walk there. What exactly will these tests tell you? And will they be painful? I have a very low tolerance for discomfort, you know. And don't tell me they'll just take a little bit of blood, because I faint at the sight of needles. Honestly. Is there a… a comfortable chair somewhere? All this talk is making me quite lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, the blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health and tell us if your blood sugar is adequately controlled. The culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, allowing us to choose the appropriate antibiotic. And the ABI will measure the blood flow to your foot, which is crucial. Please, sit down. The blood draw is routine, and we can take extra precautions to make you comfortable. The ABI is non-invasive – it simply involves measuring blood pressure at your ankle and wrist. These tests are necessary, Ms. Cannington. Delaying treatment could lead to a much more serious situation. I’ll also need to discuss the possibility of referral to a podiatrist specializing in wound care. They have tools and techniques we don’t have here at the clinic. Would you like me to have a nurse draw your blood now?
PATIENT: Oh, podiatrists now? It’s getting more complicated by the minute! Honestly, Doctor, you’re frightening me. Very well. A nurse, yes. A gentle nurse, if possible. And please, tell her to warn me before she…inserts the needle. I need to prepare myself mentally. And no sudden movements, please. This is all very distressing, you know. I haven’t been this flustered since the garden club president accused me of sabotaging her rose bushes! Honestly, the politics of horticulture are brutal. But this…this is worse. Though I suppose it’s all interconnected, really. A healthy body for a healthy garden. Yes, that makes sense. Though I still think a poultice would be a good starting point.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I'll have the nurse come in immediately. And while we wait, let me explain the importance of proper wound care and offloading pressure from your foot. I understand your preference for a poultice, but in your case, given the potential infection and poor circulation, we need a more aggressive approach. And while horticultural politics are undoubtedly complex, I assure you, this is considerably more serious.
