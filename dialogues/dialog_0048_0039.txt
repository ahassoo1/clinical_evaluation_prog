DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse just told me it was somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. Found it on some blood work, I guess. I don't rightly know what all that means, to be honest. I feel alright, mostly. Just a bit achy in the mornings, like always.
DOCTOR: Achy, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly in my joints. Knees and hips, you know? It's just…old age, probably. Been that way for years. Not terrible, just a little stiff when I first get outta bed. It doesn’t keep me from doin’ things, thankfully. I still get around pretty good for eighty-eight.
DOCTOR: Right. And this blood work…was it done recently?
PATIENT: Yep, just last week. The nice lady at the clinic called me a few days ago with the results. She said somethin’ about numbers bein’ too high, and that I needed to come in to talk to you. I don’t recall the exact numbers, though. My memory ain’t what it used to be, even if I do remember most things.
DOCTOR: Well, let’s take a look. Ah, yes. Total cholesterol is 285, LDL is 190, HDL is 35, and triglycerides are 150. Those are elevated. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My mother, bless her soul, she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older. Had to take some pills for it, I remember that. And my father...he was a strong Swede, always healthy, but he did have high blood pressure. Not cholesterol, though, I don't think. He just liked his salt, that one. We didn't talk much about numbers back then, to be honest. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, not takin' nothin' regularly. Just an aspirin every now and then if my knee acts up real bad. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty plain, mostly. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Bohnett, high cholesterol, as you’ve been told, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Given your age and family history, we need to address this. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we can discuss treatment options. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds sensible to me. Happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead whenever you’re ready. This old ticker's seen a lot of years.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, we can discuss lifestyle modifications and medication options. What’s your typical diet like on a daily basis?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly eat what my daughter brings over. She worries about me livin' alone, you see. But generally, it’s meat and potatoes, usually. Some vegetables, but not as much as I probably should eat. I like a good biscuit with my coffee in the mornin’, if I’m bein’ honest. And a bit of dessert now and again. I don't drink much soda, mostly water. And I used to enjoy a beer with dinner, but I haven’t had one in a while. I try to stay active, though. I still do a little bit of work in the garden when the weather’s good.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Bohnett, your diet is…not ideal. Reducing your intake of saturated fats and cholesterol is crucial. And increasing your fiber intake. It's all very basic. I'm going to start you on a low dose of a statin medication to help lower your cholesterol. We’ll monitor your levels with blood work in three months. I’m prescribing Atorvastatin 20mg, take one tablet daily with dinner. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on just a minute, Doctor. A medication already? I was hopin’ we could try changin’ my diet first. I don't like the idea of takin’ pills if I don’t have to. And what exactly is a statin? Is it gonna make me feel sick or somethin’? I’d like to understand what I’m puttin’ in my body, if you don’t mind explainin’ it a little better. My daughter always tells me to ask questions, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, with your cholesterol levels and age, lifestyle changes alone may not be sufficient, or may not happen quickly enough. Statins are a common medication used to lower cholesterol by reducing the production of cholesterol in the liver. They are generally well-tolerated, but side effects can include muscle aches and fatigue. I understand your hesitation, but we need to be proactive. I will explain the potential side effects in detail and provide you with written information. We can re-evaluate in three months after dietary changes and medication, and possibly lower the dosage if you experience any discomfort. It’s a matter of risk versus benefit, and at your age, the risk of not treating your high cholesterol is greater. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Alright, that makes a little more sense. Risk versus benefit, you say? I guess I can see that. I still don't like the idea of pills, but if you think it’s necessary… Can we talk a little bit more about these side effects? Like, how likely are they to happen? And what do I do if I do start feelin’ achy? Is it somethin’ I should just ignore, or do I call you right away? And what kind of things should I be eatin' instead of what I usually do? Just kinda general ideas, you know. I don’t need a whole diet plan, just…pointers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Muscle aches are the most common side effect, occurring in approximately 5-10% of patients. They typically resolve with a dosage reduction or discontinuation of the medication. If you experience severe muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine, you should contact me immediately, as it could indicate a rare but serious condition. As for diet, focus on lean proteins like fish and chicken, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats like olive oil and avocados. Reduce your intake of red meat, processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats found in fried foods and baked goods. I can provide you with a pamphlet on heart-healthy eating. It’s not about drastic changes overnight, Mr. Bohnett. Small, incremental steps are key. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds…doable, I guess. Small steps, you say? I can handle small steps. And the pamphlet sounds good, thank you. Dark urine…that sounds scary. I'll remember that. One more question, if you don't mind. Will this medicine interact with anything else? Like, I take a little bit of aspirin now and then for my knee. Is that okay? I just wanna make sure I don’t mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, in low doses, generally doesn’t interact significantly with statins. However, it can slightly increase the risk of muscle problems. It’s best to avoid regular, long-term use of aspirin unless specifically recommended by your doctor for other conditions. I’m documenting that you take aspirin occasionally for knee pain. I will also include a warning about potential interactions with other medications. Do you take any other supplements or over-the-counter drugs that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just the aspirin, like I said. And sometimes a little bit of vitamin D in the winter, but that's about it. My daughter gives me the vitamin D, she says I don't get enough sunshine. I think that's all. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just tryin' to stay healthy and enjoy my garden. So, I guess we're all set for now? You want me to get the prescription filled and start takin' the pills?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bohnett, that is correct. Get the prescription filled, start the Atorvastatin 20mg daily with dinner, and follow the dietary recommendations. I’ll see you back in three months for a follow-up blood test and evaluation. Here’s a requisition for the blood work. If you experience any unusual symptoms, contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that about covers it. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything pretty well, even if I don't like what I'm hearin'. I appreciate you takin' the time to talk to me. I'll see you in three months.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Bohnett. .
