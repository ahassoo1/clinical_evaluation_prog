DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, well, my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, my chest. It’s kinda… sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. Can you tell me a little more about that soreness?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say. Not like a bad pain, more like… achy? Mostly on this side. And sometimes… it feels like it goes all the way to my arm. Not always, though. It’s been happening for… maybe a week now? I don’t really keep track of dates good.
DOCTOR: Alright, achy chest pain on the left side, radiating sometimes to your arm, for about a week. That’s helpful. Does anything specific cause the pain to start, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really that I know of. Maybe… if I’m lifting stuff at work? But I lift stuff all the time. It doesn’t happen every time. And sometimes it just… is there. I don’t know. It's not like when I fall, you know? It's just… a sore feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem directly related to exertion, but maybe sometimes?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe. Sometimes. It's hard to say for sure. Work is… work. Lots of moving and lifting. It's just… always something hurts after a long day. This is… different, though. Not like a muscle pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re noticing that it’s different than your usual work aches. Let's try to get a better picture of this. Besides the chest pain and radiating to your arm, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. No fever, no coughing. Nothing like that. My wife asked if there was a lump, but I didn’t feel anything. She worries a lot. I didn’t think it felt like a lump, but she’s good at finding things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it's thoughtful of your wife to check. No fever, no cough, no lump felt. Have you had any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, dizziness, or palpitations—like your heart racing or skipping a beat?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I… what's “palpitations”? My heart feels normal, I think. I can breathe okay. No sweating or anything. Just… the sore chest. And sometimes the arm. It doesn’t make me feel sick, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations just mean feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering. So no racing heart, no nausea, just the chest discomfort and occasional arm pain. That's good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t really… been to the doctor much. Just for work injuries, you know? Cuts and scrapes. Nothing serious. I’m pretty healthy, I think. Just… work hard. My wife says I need to take better care of myself. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And no previous surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… banged up a few times at work. Nothing that needed cutting. Mostly just aches and pains that go away. This one… hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had… something with her heart, I think. A long time ago. She passed away when I was young. My dad was okay, healthy as can be. Worked on a farm his whole life. And my brother… he’s fine. No problems that I know of. I don’t know much about what happened with my mom, it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a heart condition, and your father and brother are currently healthy. Do you know what specifically your mother’s heart condition was?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Everyone said it was… something with her valves, maybe? I was just a kid. I don’t remember much. It was… a long time ago. And nobody really talked about it much after she passed. It wasn’t a happy thing to talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's okay that you don't know the specifics. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Don't smoke. My wife wouldn't let me. She says it's bad for my health. And she's right, of course. She always is.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A beer or two with dinner, maybe on the weekend. Nothing much. Not every day. My wife likes a glass of wine sometimes too. We don't drink a lot. Not enough to cause trouble, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't take anything. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I just… tough it out, usually. My wife gives me some vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. I'm not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or regular vitamin use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your chest. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me if something's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackling. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but can be affected by stress or anxiety. And your pulse is 78, also a little on the higher side. Now, I'm going to gently feel around your chest to check for tenderness or any masses. Please let me know if anything feels painful. There's some slight tenderness on the left side of your chest, where you mentioned the pain. No obvious masses. Everything feels… normal otherwise. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, based on what you've told me and the exam, your symptoms could be due to a few things. The chest pain could be musculoskeletal—related to the muscles and bones in your chest—or it could be related to some cardiac issues, especially given the murmur I heard and your mother's history. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… serious. Muscular… what’s that mean? And what about my heart? Should I be worried? I don’t want to have something like my mom.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, especially with your mother's history. "Musculoskeletal" just means related to your muscles, bones, and joints. It's common to have chest pain from strain or inflammation in these areas, especially with physical work. However, we can't rule out a cardiac cause without further investigation. The murmur I heard suggests there could be something going on with your heart valves, but it's not definitive. It’s important to get this checked out properly. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. First, an EKG—that’s a quick, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Then, a chest X-ray to rule out any problems with your lungs or heart size. And finally, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and some cardiac enzymes to rule out any heart damage. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… tests. Yeah, that’s fine. I want to know what’s going on. What do I have to do for these tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to get back to work, you know? But I don’t want to ignore this if it’s something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll get this sorted out. The EKG is very quick—it involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about five minutes. The chest X-ray is also quick—you’ll just stand in front of a machine while it takes a picture of your chest. That takes a few minutes as well. The blood work involves drawing a small amount of blood from your arm—you’ll need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except water. The results usually take a few days—typically 2-3 business days for the blood work and X-ray, and the EKG results are usually available right away. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or what to expect?
PATIENT: No… I think that makes sense. Fasting… 8 hours? That’s a long time. Okay. And… what if something is wrong with my heart? What happens then? Will I need… surgery? Like my mom?
DOCTOR: It is a long time to fast, I know. You can drink water, though, to stay hydrated. It's understandable to be worried about what happens if something is wrong with your heart. It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for sure yet—these tests are just to get more information. If the tests reveal a heart problem, the next steps will depend on what the problem is. It could range from lifestyle changes—like diet and exercise—to medication, or, in some cases, more advanced procedures. It’s unlikely you would need surgery immediately, especially with the information we have now. If surgery were necessary, it would be a carefully planned procedure. We would discuss all of your options with you in detail, and you would have plenty of time to ask questions and make an informed decision. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I'll have my nurse give you the orders for the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the tests and what to expect. Do you have any questions for me before we get to that?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Just… the tests. I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to get you answers. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the test orders with you. And remember, try not to worry too much until we have the results. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. .
