DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Parascondola. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. It’s my foot, see? It's been swelling up. Not all the time, but… yeah, mostly in the evenings. It’s kinda bothering me to walk sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the foot, mostly in the evenings… and it makes walking difficult sometimes. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe three, four weeks ago? It was gradual, not like a sudden thing. I noticed it after I did some gardening, actually. I was pulling weeds, bending a lot… but it hasn’t gone away completely, even with resting it. I remember the date pretty clearly 'cause the tomatoes were finally starting to turn red! July 10th, I think.
DOCTOR: July 10th, okay. So, it started with the gardening, and it’s been persistent since then. And you said it's worse in the evenings?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely worse at night. Like, after I’ve been on it all day. It feels… tighter, heavier, you know? And a little bit achy. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t always help much. I also noticed it's a little red sometimes, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swelling, redness intermittently, tightness, and achiness, worse in the evenings after being on your feet. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. It just… feels puffy, like it's filled with water, maybe? And warm, sometimes. Not hot, just… warmer than my other foot. I haven't really paid too much attention to the other foot, to be honest. I guess I should.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to your foot in the past, or any other medical conditions like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: No injuries that I can remember, no. I twisted my ankle years ago, when I was a young man playing soccer, but that was a long time ago. And no, no diabetes or arthritis or anything like that. The doctor told me my blood sugar was fine last time, maybe five years ago? I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of fish, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior injuries or conditions like diabetes or arthritis. Last blood sugar check was normal five years ago. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. And no allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. I drink a lot of water, that's about it. I used to take something for my back, years back, but I stopped that a long time ago. It didn’t really help much anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or allergies. Good. Now, I’m going to take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go, Doctor. It's not as bad right now, 'cause I've been sitting, but you can see it's a little puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see some swelling around the ankle and midfoot. It is warmer than the other side. And there's some tenderness when I press here, along the outside of your ankle. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can wiggle 'em. It feels a little stiff though, not as easy as it used to be. And… a little bit achy when I do that. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, and can you try to point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: There. Like this? It's… harder than it looks. And it feels… tight. Definitely tight. Not as much movement as I usually have. It kinda hurts when I push it too far down. Oh, and it's definitely more uncomfortable now you're asking me to do it. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see reduced range of motion and some discomfort with movement. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a sprain or strain of the ankle ligaments. It’s difficult to say for sure without an X-ray to rule out a fracture, though. I'd like to order an X-ray just to be safe. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh. Well… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, okay. I don’t want it to be anything serious. I need to be able to walk. Is it gonna hurt? And… how long will it take? I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. It won’t hurt much at all, just a brief pressure when the technician takes the images. It should only take a few minutes. After the X-ray, we'll review the results and I can give you a better idea of what's going on and what we need to do. Let me get the order for the X-ray sent to the radiology department. They're just down the hall. Once they're done, they’ll call me with the results. In the meantime, I recommend keeping weight off of your foot as much as possible, using ice packs for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and elevating it when you're resting. Does that sound doable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Ice and keep it up. I can do that. Elevate it… I’ll try. My apartment is kinda small, not a lot of room to put my feet up. But I’ll manage. So, you think it’s not broken then? Just… twisted? That's good to know. How long will the X-ray take? And will I have to wait long for the results? I really need to know.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself should only take a few minutes. The radiologist usually gets back to me within an hour or two with the results. I'll call you as soon as I have them. It’s hard to say for sure if it’s a fracture without the images, but that's why we're doing the X-ray. In the meantime, the ice and elevation will help reduce any swelling and pain. Do you have any questions for me before you head over to radiology?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… ice and keep it up. And wait for the call. Thank you. I hope it’s not too bad. Where exactly is the radiology department? Down the hall, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, down the hall to your left. The receptionist will check you in and let them know I sent you. If you have any trouble finding it, just ask anyone at the front desk, they'll be happy to point you in the right direction. I'll be here, and I'll call you as soon as I have the results. Try to relax, and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening pain or can’t put any weight on your foot at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
