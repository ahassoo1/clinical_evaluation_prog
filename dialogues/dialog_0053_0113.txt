DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like all I do is go, go, go. It’s a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, but my wife… she gets after me about it. Says I’m always running to the loo. Honestly, I don't even remember when it started. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” right. Well, it could be a number of things. Frequent urination, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, frequent. And… it’s not painful, not exactly. Just… gotta go all the time. Especially at night. Wakes me up. Drives me mad, it does. I used to sleep like a log. Now… I don’t even know how many times I get up. My wife keeps track, I guess. She’s good at that sort of thing. Numbers and all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much is “all the time,” Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: How much…? That’s a… a good question. Honestly, I haven’t been counting. I drink a normal amount, I suppose. Coffee in the morning, some water with meals. Not like I’m guzzling it down. But… I’d say… more than a normal person? If that makes any sense. It’s just… a lot. Especially compared to how it used to be. Everything goes when you get older, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. And when you say “normal,” what would you consider normal?
PATIENT: Normal… Well, back when I was farming, you know, working hard all day, I wouldn’t think much about it. Maybe a couple of times a day. Now? Now it's... ... well, it feels like every hour, maybe less. And definitely a couple times at night. It’s just… irritating. I’m not sick, I don't feel sick. It’s just an… inconvenience. My wife says I need to see a doctor, but honestly, I think she just wants a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Let’s see what we can find. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate?
PATIENT: Changes…? What do you mean? It… it comes out normal. Well, as normal as it ever does. It doesn't burn or anything, and the stream is… you know… steady enough. Not weak, not strong, just… regular. Look, Doctor, I'm an old farmer. I don't pay attention to all the details. I just go when I need to go. I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. I see here you’ve had a few routine check-ups over the years. No major issues noted. Any family history of… prostate problems, perhaps?
PATIENT: Prostate…? Hmm. My father… he wasn’t much for doctors. Always said they just wanted to poke around. I think he had some trouble… later in life. Down there, you know. But he never said anything specific. Just grumbled a lot and went to the outhouse more often, I reckon. My brother, now he went to the doctor. But I haven’t seen him in years. Can’t remember what he had wrong with him, if anything. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked about these things. It was just… private. Does it matter? It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It could matter, Mr. Segretto. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to rule a few things out. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. I suppose so. But I'm telling you, it's just old age. Nothing to worry about. Still… better to get it over with, I guess. Though I don’t like doctors poking around, never have. Just… don’t take too long, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check your prostate. It'll only take a few moments. Just relax. Hmm. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but not markedly. No obvious nodules. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, but we’ll need to do a urine test to rule out infection and check your kidney function. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a sample.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't pleasant. Urine test, eh? More poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, I told you it was just old age. But alright, alright. If you insist. The nurse, you say? I hope she's gentle. This whole thing is just a waste of time, but my wife… she'd never let me hear the end of it if I didn’t come. So, alright. A urine test. Let’s get it over with. . .
DOCTOR: We’ll see what the results show, Mr. Segretto. In the meantime, try to drink a normal amount of fluids, but avoid caffeine. The nurse will be in shortly. .
