DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… it’s my stomach. Been having issues. Bad ones. And nothing the usual people have tried is working, so I guess I’m here.
DOCTOR: I understand you're pressed for time, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. “Bad issues” can mean a lot of things, so let's try to narrow it down. Could you describe what you mean by “issues”?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… diarrhea. Okay? Constant diarrhea. It just… won’t stop. And it’s not like a little bit, it's… a lot. I’ve been dealing with it for weeks now. Honestly, I’m just exhausted. I've tried everything the pharmacy suggested, those things for upset stomachs, but they do nothing. It's just...flowing.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant diarrhea for weeks is certainly concerning, and understandably exhausting. Thank you for being so direct with me. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, do I have to? It’s embarrassing. But fine. It’s… watery. Very watery. Multiple times a day. Like, ten or more times. And it’s not just after I eat. It happens randomly. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with it. It's cramping too, bad cramps. And honestly? It smells awful. I don’t even want to go into detail. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I assure you, these types of issues are common, and nothing to be embarrassed about. It’s important to be thorough, so thank you for sharing those details. Ten or more times a day with cramping and a noticeable change in odor… that does sound quite disruptive. Are you experiencing any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Just… the constant running. And the cramping. I get a little nauseous sometimes, but it doesn’t usually… progress. I just feel weak and tired all the time. Honestly, I just want to be able to leave the house without having to plan my route around every single bathroom. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand how debilitating that can be, Ms. Woodring. Planning your life around bathroom access is certainly not ideal. Now, let's go over some other things to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? You need to know everything? Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I don't examine my… waste. But… I think I saw a little bit of red once, maybe? It could have been something I ate, I don’t know. And yeah, it's… different. Slimier, I guess. Is that what mucus is? I don't know medical terms, I told you. This is awful. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m being too detailed, Ms. Woodring. It’s just important to gather all the information possible. You’re right, you shouldn't be expected to know medical terminology. Seeing a little bit of red and noticing a change in consistency to be slimier are both things we need to investigate. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain besides the cramping?
PATIENT: It’s just… a general ache. Like, my whole stomach hurts. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And bloated. Always bloated. It feels like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner even when I haven’t. And it doesn’t go away. I’ve tried… gas pills. They don’t help. Honestly, it’s just a constant, dull ache. It's exhausting even feeling like this.
DOCTOR: A constant, dull ache and bloating… okay. Now, let’s shift gears a bit. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No. I eat the same things. Pretty much. Salmon, rice, vegetables. I try to eat healthy. It's not like I've been going crazy with spicy food or anything. I'm a grown woman, I know what I can and can't handle. It's not that. It just… started happening. And it won't stop. Really, I'm starting to think something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Woodring. It's frustrating when things change without an obvious cause. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just… my heart. After my husband… passed. It was a shock. They said it was stress-related. I’m on some medication for it, a beta blocker, I think. And that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t get sick often. Never have. This is… new. And annoying. Frankly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your loss, Ms. Woodring. That must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for mentioning the medication for your heart. That’s important information. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. I just take the little white pill every morning. The doctor prescribed it. I don’t memorize medication names, okay? I have a pharmacy for that. I don’t know… Metoprolol? Maybe? Something like that. Honestly, I’m not good with remembering things. It’s just been a stressful few years. Can we just… get to the point? Is there something seriously wrong with me or not? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for asking so many questions. It's important for me to have a complete picture. Metoprolol is correct. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. Well, not everything, but I don't have any allergies. Never have. This isn't an allergy, I can tell you that much. It's something else. I just... want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? Can we please just run some tests or something? I'm wasting my entire day here.
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all, Ms. Woodring. I completely understand your desire to feel normal again and I agree, it’s time we start investigating with some tests. I’d like to order a stool sample analysis, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. These will help us rule out infection, inflammation, and electrolyte imbalances. We may also need to consider imaging, like a CT scan, depending on the results of these initial tests. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it done. I need to know what’s going on. And can I get a note for work? I’m going to be out for… who knows how long? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I have better things to do than sit around waiting for test results. Just… get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I'll have the lab requisition forms ready for you, and I'll also write a note for your employer explaining your absence for medical evaluation. I'll also have my nurse draw some blood before you leave. The stool sample can be collected at home, and we’ll give you instructions on how to properly collect and submit it. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available, which typically takes 2-3 business days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
