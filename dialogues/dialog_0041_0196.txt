DOCTOR: Hi Janie, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… chronic… fatigue, I think that’s what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, it all feels a bit blurry. I just… get tired. A lot. It’s been going on for… a while now, I suppose. I don't really keep track of dates anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue… that's a good place to start. It is blurry sometimes, don't worry about the dates. "A while now" is helpful enough. Just to get a little more specific, can you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like… after a long day, you know? It’s… through the day. Like I never really wake up properly. And it doesn't really get better with resting. I just… feel drained. Everything feels… heavy. It's hard to explain. I just wish I had more energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds really difficult. "Through the day" and not relieved by rest… that’s important information. And the feeling of heaviness… I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh, sometimes my muscles ache. Not all the time, but… yeah, aches. And… I forget things. A lot. Not important things, usually… just… names. Faces. What I went to the store for. My memory’s not what it used to be, that’s for sure. My husband used to say… Oh. Never mind.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and memory problems… okay. It's good you're telling me all this, even the little things. It all helps build a picture. Do you have any trouble sleeping, Janie?
PATIENT: Sleeping… I can sleep, if I get into bed. But it’s not… restful. I wake up a lot. And sometimes I just… lie there for hours. Thinking. Or not thinking, just… being awake. It’s frustrating. I wouldn’t say it’s a problem, exactly, just… not good sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you can sleep, but it's not refreshing and you experience some wakefulness during the night. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember to. Sometimes I don't feel very hungry. But I haven't lost or gained any weight, I don't think. I'm pretty… small, always have been. Medicare checks it every year, and they haven’t said anything. I suppose that means it's okay?
DOCTOR: Medicare checking your weight annually is good information. Okay, so no significant changes in appetite or weight. Now, thinking about your medical history… do you have any long-term health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. My husband… he always handled the doctor stuff. I know I have… something with my blood pressure. And… arthritis, maybe? In my hands. It’s not terrible. Mostly just a little stiff. Honestly, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It’s been a while since I had a proper check-up, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and possible arthritis in your hands. That's a good starting point. Don't worry about not remembering everything, we'll figure it out. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was a child. But… that’s all I can really remember. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Not since… well, not for a long time. This is all a bit much, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken wrist in the past. That’s helpful. It is a lot to go through, don’t worry, we’ll take our time. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. My mother… she had heart trouble. And my father… he had something with his lungs. But honestly, I wasn’t very close to either of them. And I don’t really know much about their families before them. It’s all a bit… blurry. I wish I could be more help, but my memory just isn’t what it used to be. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Janie. You're doing just fine. Knowing about heart trouble and lung issues in your parents is helpful, even if the details are vague. We can often find more information in records if needed. And finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I don’t smoke. Never have. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, since my husband passed. And I certainly don’t do any of that! I’m a simple woman, Doctor. Just trying to get through the day. This fatigue… it’s really getting me down.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Janie. And I understand. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your life, and that's what we need to address. Okay, so to summarize, you've been experiencing chronic fatigue, muscle aches, and some memory problems. You're sleeping but not feeling rested, and you have a history of high blood pressure and possible arthritis. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just to check a few things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. This is exhausting. Let's do whatever you need to do. I just... would you please be quick? I have a few things I need to get done today. If I can even manage to get to them.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll do my best to be as efficient as possible. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, but your heartbeat is a little fast. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is a bit tender in the upper right side. Reflexes are normal, and muscle strength is good. I can see some swelling in your hands, and your fingers are a little stiff. Okay, all done. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, no, that was fine. The hands… yes, they bother me sometimes. Especially in the morning. So, what does it all mean, Doctor? What’s wrong with me? Is it serious? I just want to know what I’m dealing with. I don’t want to sit around waiting for it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there are a few things we need to investigate further. Your fatigue, muscle aches, and memory problems could be caused by a number of things – vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, sleep apnea, even stress or depression. The elevated blood pressure and tenderness in your abdomen also need attention. I don’t want to jump to conclusions or scare you, but it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to get a better picture of your overall health. I also want to order a scan of your abdomen - probably an ultrasound - to see what’s causing the tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a scan… yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary. It’s just… a lot. I haven’t had many tests done in years. I always just… avoided the doctor. But this fatigue… it’s getting worse. So, yes, go ahead. Do whatever you need to do. And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know what’s going on, as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot, Janie, and I apologize for that. We’ll get through this together. The blood tests should take about 2-3 business days to come back. The ultrasound will likely be scheduled within the next week, and the results should be available a few days after that. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan of action. In the meantime, I'd like you to try and get as much rest as possible, drink plenty of water, and eat a balanced diet. I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activity until we have a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s alright. Rest, water, balanced diet… yes, I can manage that. I just… I wish I knew what was wrong. It’s the not knowing that’s the worst. Thank you, Doctor. For… for listening. And for trying to help. I appreciate it. Is there anything I need to do before the tests? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. I understand how frustrating it is to be in limbo, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. For the blood tests, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is fine. The lab will give you specific instructions when you schedule your appointment, but it's best to plan ahead. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally before your scan. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to schedule both appointments. She can also answer any questions you may have. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you to Sarah, too. I appreciate all your help. I suppose I’ll go home and try to get some rest, then. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to get some rest. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care now. Goodbye. .
