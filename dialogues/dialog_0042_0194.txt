DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a bit of a bother, really. My hearing… it comes and goes. And sometimes, the room just spins. It's hard to explain. My daughter, Lani, she booked this appointment for me. She worries something awful. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling when your hearing fluctuates and you experience dizziness. It's good of Lani to look out for you. “Comes and goes” is a helpful start. Can you tell me a little more about the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh, it is unsettling. Like someone’s turned the volume down, then back up again. Not all at once, you understand. More… gradual. And it’s usually just in one ear, I think. Or maybe both? It’s hard to be sure. It doesn't last long, usually. A few hours, maybe a day. Then it’s… normal again. Or as normal as it gets for someone my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Fluctuating hearing loss in one or both ears is certainly something we need to investigate. And you mentioned dizziness – can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like being seasick, if that makes sense. It's more like… everything's tilting. And not just the room, but me too. It’s hard to stand steady. I have to hold onto something. It doesn't happen with the hearing loss every time, mind you. Sometimes it’s just the hearing, other times it’s the spinning. And sometimes, it's both at once. It’s all a bit… muddled, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be muddled when things aren’t happening predictably. So, to clarify, the tilting sensation—does that come on suddenly, or does it build up gradually?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I think. It just… whoosh. One minute I’m fine, the next I’m grabbing for the wall. It doesn't last forever, thankfully. Usually just a few minutes, maybe half an hour. But it’s scary when it happens. Especially when I’m out and about. My late husband, Tom… he always used to steady me.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about Tom. It’s understandable that these episodes bring up those memories. Sudden onset of that tilting sensation is important information. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… that’s a good question. I haven't really thought about it. I don't think so. It seems to happen at random. I mean, I've had it when I'm resting, and when I'm out shopping, and even once when I was gardening. I don’t really see a pattern. My daughter Lani keeps asking if I’m stressed, but… well, life is life, isn’t it? I don’t think it’s anything special.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it’s helpful that you’re able to tell me it doesn’t seem related to specific activities or stress. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a pill for that. A small white one. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, so they ache sometimes. Other than that… Nothing major, I don't think. I get the usual aches and pains for someone my age. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but after Tom passed… it just got harder to keep up with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing Tom must have made it difficult to prioritize those things. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure and arthritis. Do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names. That’s always been my trouble. I’m terrible with names. The blood pressure one… it’s a small white pill, like I said. I think it starts with an ‘A’? Or maybe a ‘B’? I really couldn’t say for certain. And the arthritis one… the doctor gave me a little orange one for that. I take it with my breakfast. Honestly, Lani handles most of that now. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about it. We can look those up in your records. Lani sounds very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat everything! Tom always said I had a cast iron stomach. I've never had to worry about allergies, thankfully. I’m not even sure what I would do if I had one! I suppose it’s something I should have paid more attention to, but… well, it never came up.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was a long time ago! And I had a hysterectomy… goodness, it must be thirty years ago now. Other than that… Nothing major that I can recall. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I've just been a bit unlucky lately with this hearing and spinning. It's worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry. It’s good to know about the tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. Finally, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that’s a tricky one. Tom’s side of the family, they had heart trouble. His father died young from it. My mother… she had diabetes. And my sister, bless her soul, she had trouble with her balance as she got older. Kept falling, she did. I don’t know if that’s anything to do with my problems, but… it’s all I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll check your ears, your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to poke too hard, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. Your ears appear normal, although there is some earwax buildup. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not critically high. During the balance tests, I noticed a slight unsteadiness when you close your eyes, and a mild difficulty with coordination on the finger-to-nose test. I will document these findings.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound too good, does it? Unsteady… is that serious? I have been tripping a bit lately, now that you mention it. I just thought I was getting clumsy. What does it mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’re exploring this, Ms. Mayhugh. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. The unsteadiness and mild coordination issues, combined with your history of fluctuating hearing loss and spinning sensation, suggests a few possibilities. One possibility is a condition called Meniere's disease, which affects the inner ear. Another could be vestibular neuritis, which is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which controls balance. And we also need to consider the possibility of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV, which is caused by small calcium crystals in the inner ear. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some tests. First, I’d like to get a hearing test, or audiogram, to assess your hearing levels. Then, I’d like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying infections or vitamin deficiencies. And finally, I think it would be helpful to get a VNG test, which is a specialized test that assesses your inner ear function and balance. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that’s a lot of big words! Meniere’s… vestibular… what now? It sounds… complicated. I just want to be able to hear properly and not fall over! If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, go ahead with the tests. I trust you. Just… please explain the results to me in plain English, alright? And if it’s something serious… well, I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. I completely understand. I will explain everything in plain English, and we'll take things one step at a time. Don't worry about the big words – we'll focus on what they mean for you. The hearing test will simply measure how well you can hear different sounds. The blood test will just check for any general health issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. And the VNG test is a little more involved, but it’s painless. It involves wearing goggles and having you move your head in different directions while we record your eye movements. It helps us see how your inner ear is working. I’ll write up the orders for those tests now. The clinic will contact you to schedule them. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity and be careful when walking. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about it. I suppose I’ll just wait for the phone call then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Here’s a summary of today’s visit and the orders for your tests. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please be careful, Ms. Mayhugh. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Vodzak. I appreciate your kindness. Goodbye.
