DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Mutnick, you say? Hmm. Well, I been... short of breath, I guess. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. It’s been gettin’ worse, slow like. Don't know why it's happenin', though. I ain’t a young man anymore, but I ain't always felt like this.
DOCTOR: “Slow like,” you say. And how long precisely has this “slow like” progression been occurring?
PATIENT: Precise? Doctor, you askin' a lot. Let me think... oh, geez. Maybe… six months? Seven? Time kinda runs together these days. It weren't somethin' sudden, see? Just… more and more hard to catch my breath. Especially when I walk. Used to be able to walk a mile, no problem. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Very well. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I reckon. It’s worse when I’m movin’ around, like I said. Sittin' still, it ain’t so bad. But try walkin’ up a small hill? Forget about it. Makes me feel like I’m breathin’ through a straw. And this dryness… it’s just always there. Even when I’m drinkin’ water. Not much helps, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Maybe a little? Hard to tell, Doc. I got these old legs, you know? They swell sometimes just from bein’ legs. Not like, balloon swellin’, but… a bit puffy, maybe? I mostly just ignore it.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness alongside the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no pain. Palpitations… what's that even mean? My heart feels normal enough, I guess. It beats. Dizziness... sometimes, when I stand up real fast, I get a little woozy. But that happens to old folks, right? I ain't fallin' over or anything. Just a little spinny.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you have a list of current medications you are taking, or any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications... Shoot. I think I got somethin' at home, but I ain’t sure. The little pills... for my blood pressure, maybe? The doctor gave me somethin' a while back. Allergies... no, I don’t think so. Never had no bad reaction to nothin’. I just don't keep track of that stuff, Doc. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Relax... easier said than done when you can’t breathe, Doc. But I’ll try. Just get it over with, huh? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I can hear some mild crackling in your lungs, particularly on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 145 over 90. Now, let me examine your extremities for any edema. Yes, there is indeed some pitting edema present in both ankles. I'm going to need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: X-rays and blood work… Now hold on a minute, Doc. You stickin’ needles in me and makin’ me stand in that scary machine? I ain't a fan of none of that. Is it really necessary? Can't you just give me somethin’ for the breathin’ and the dry mouth?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, with all due respect, I am attempting to determine the cause of your symptoms, not simply mask them. The blood work will assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. The chest X-ray will allow me to visualize your lungs and heart, which is critical. I understand your apprehension, but these are standard procedures. We can discuss alternative methods if absolutely necessary, but they may not provide the same level of diagnostic accuracy. Are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, that’s mighty fancy talk, Doc. I just wanna breathe easier! And my mouth feels like sandpaper. No, no pain. Just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Look, I don't like needles, and I don't like machines. But if you really think it's important... I guess… I guess you can poke me and put me in the machine. But you better be quick about it. And tell me what you find, understand? I don't want no mumbo jumbo, just plain English.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will expedite the process as much as possible. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Following that, we will proceed with the chest X-ray. I assure you, I will explain the results in a clear and understandable manner. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe a temporary bronchodilator to help alleviate your shortness of breath. And a saline mouth spray for the dryness. Is there anyone I can contact in case of emergency?
PATIENT: Emergency? Shoot… no, not really. I'm a bit of a loner, Doc. Never married, no kids. Got a… a cousin somewhere, I think. But I haven't spoken to her in years. Don't even remember her name. Just... don't bother anyone. I’ll be alright. Mostly. Just get me breathin' normal again, that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will proceed without that information. The nurse will be in momentarily with the prescription and to draw your blood. Please remain seated. I trust you’ll follow the instructions provided carefully. If your condition worsens, seek immediate medical attention. And try to stay hydrated.
PATIENT: Hydrated... Easy for him to say. This desert mouth ain’t makin’ it easy. Well, I guess I’ll just sit here and wait for the pokin’ to begin. .
