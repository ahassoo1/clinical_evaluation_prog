DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Nissenbaum, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's ridiculous I even have to be here. Woke up this morning and half my face feels… floppy. And I can't hear out of one ear. It’s quite inconvenient, really. Don’t tell me it’s a cold, I don’t do colds.
DOCTOR: "Floppy," you say. And you can't hear from one ear. Right. How long has this “floppiness” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t write that down. It sounds…undignified. Just since this morning, really. Woke up, went to brush my teeth, and that’s when I noticed. It's not like it built up gradually, it was sudden. And the ear…completely silent. It’s very unsettling. Do you need me to repeat that? I doubt you were listening anyway.
DOCTOR: Sudden onset. Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness. Let me think. No fever. No headache. Taste is…normal, I suppose. Though my cook makes excellent food, so it’s hard to tell. I haven't felt dizzy, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, it's just this…problem with my face. And the silence. It's really quite disruptive. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any weakness in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. I mean, I’m not doing manual labor, if that’s what you’re implying. I haven’t been struggling to lift anything. My arms feel…arms, and my legs feel…legs. Is this a trick question? Honestly, I don't appreciate being spoken to like this. It's just my face!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of stroke or neurological problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Let me see… My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my uncle, on my father’s side, was… a bit eccentric. Always rambling, if that counts as a neurological problem. No strokes, as far as I know. They didn’t discuss medical things openly. It wasn’t considered proper. Are we getting anywhere with this? I truly haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I believe in a good diet and plenty of rest. And a strong constitution. I don't pollute my body with…chemicals. Though, I did take an antacid once, after a particularly rich dessert. But that was years ago. Honestly, this is getting rather tedious. I was hoping for a quick diagnosis, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look. If you could just sit up straight…and please try to relax. I need to examine your face and ears.
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And don’t expect me to hold still for long. Honestly, I don’t see what poking and prodding is going to achieve. It's obviously something…facial. Perhaps a nerve? Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Facial symmetry is… diminished on the left side. And your left ear canal appears clear, but there’s no response to basic hearing tests. I’m noting…decreased facial tone on the left side, and absent response to auditory stimuli in the left ear. It’s…unlikely to be “something facial.” We need to consider other possibilities.
PATIENT: Other possibilities? Like what? I told you, it’s sudden. And it’s only one side. It’s not like I’m paralyzed or something. Honestly, you doctors always jump to the worst conclusions. Is this going to require…testing? Because I have a very busy schedule. I’m not inclined to spend hours in a waiting room. And frankly, I don’t even have insurance. So let’s be efficient, shall we?
DOCTOR: Given the sudden onset and unilateral symptoms – facial weakness and hearing loss – we need to rule out a more serious cause. I’m thinking…Bell’s palsy is a possibility, but we need to rule out a stroke. We'll need a CT scan of your head to be certain. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? A neurologist? Honestly! This is ridiculous. I come in here with a slightly floppy face and suddenly I need a battery of tests and specialist appointments? And you expect me to pay for all of this? I don’t understand why I even bothered. Perhaps a second opinion is in order. I think I’ll just…manage it myself. This has been a complete waste of time. .
