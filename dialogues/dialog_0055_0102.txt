DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just… find myself sighing a lot these days. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… a lot. It happens without me even thinking about it, sometimes. It’s been going on for a while now, I think. Maybe a few months? It’s hard to say, time… slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: A few months of increased sighing… I see. While it may seem… insignificant to you, Mr. Vantine, any change in your baseline respiratory pattern warrants investigation. To clarify, are these sighs… spontaneous, or are they linked to any particular activity or emotion?
PATIENT: Oh, “respiratory pattern,” is that what you call it? Fancy! No, not really linked to anything, Doctor. I don't think so, anyway. I could be… watering the plants, or watching the news, or just sitting here… and whoosh… a big sigh. It doesn't feel sad, or worried, or anything like that. Just… air leaving my body, I suppose. It’s just… a lot more than usual, you know? I used to be able to hold my breath a long time, when I was younger. Not anymore, haha. Though I don’t try to hold it anymore, mind you. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, age certainly brings changes. “Old bones” as you say. Still, we must rule out any underlying cause. Do you experience any other symptoms along with these sighs, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes my chest feels a little… tight. Not painful, just… full. Like I haven't taken a good breath in a while, even after I sigh. And… I get tired easier, maybe? But I’m eighty years old, so that could just be… well, being eighty. My wife… she used to say I was always a bit of a napper. She’s gone now, though. Best cook in the world, she was. Sorry, getting off track. What were we talking about? Oh, yes, symptoms. Nothing much, really. Just the tightness and the naps.
DOCTOR: Right. Tightness in the chest, fatigue. And frequent sighing. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Swelling… Well, now that you mention it… maybe a little. I used to have nice, skinny ankles. Not so skinny anymore, haha. I thought it was just the heat, you know? It's been awfully warm this summer. And… I haven't been walking as much. Just haven’t had the… the pep, I guess. My wife, she always took me for walks. We used to go to the park every day. But… no, not much swelling. Just a little puffiness, maybe?
DOCTOR: Puffiness, you say. Very well. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, Mr. Vantine, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your lungs and heart, and checking your extremities. This will allow me to assess the… situation more thoroughly. Please, have a seat and recline back slightly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Sounds sensible. I don't mind at all. My heart… it’s seen a lot of years, that heart. Still ticking, though. Still ticking. Go ahead, Doctor. Take your time. I suppose I should have told you… I was a police officer, you know. First-line supervisor. Lots of running around back then. Maybe that has something to do with it? Though that was… a long time ago. Stop.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear bilaterally, though there is some mild diminished breath sound at the bases. Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. Moderate pitting edema in both ankles. Mr. Vantine, given your age, the recent increase in sighing, the chest tightness, fatigue, and the presence of edema, I suspect this may be related to early signs of congestive heart failure. It’s not necessarily a severe condition at this point, but it requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Congestive… what now? Heart… failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. I don’t… I don’t understand. Is that… is that why I’m so tired? And the sighing? Is my heart… stopping? My wife… she had a bad heart, later in life. Is that what this is? I… I don’t want to… I don't want to end up like her. What does "further investigation" even mean, Doctor? Will it hurt? Stop.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, please, try to remain calm. "Congestive heart failure" simply means your heart is not pumping as efficiently as it once did. It does not mean it is stopping, and it is frequently manageable with medication. The sighing and fatigue are common symptoms. "Further investigation" will involve a few simple tests, including an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look for any fluid buildup in your lungs. There will be a blood draw to check your electrolytes and kidney function. These tests are not painful. Given your age and lack of insurance, I recommend we start with the EKG and chest X-ray. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They offer a sliding scale fee. We will discuss the results after we have them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a sliding scale, you say? That’s… good. Thank goodness. I don’t have much money, you see. My wife… she managed everything. I’m just… not very good with these things. An EKG and a… chest X-ray. And a blood draw? Oh dear. I don’t like needles. But… if it helps… if it will make me feel better… then yes. Yes, that sounds acceptable, Doctor. A sliding scale fee… you’re a kind woman. My wife would have liked you. Okay. An EKG and a chest X-ray. Tell me, Doctor… will they tell me right away if anything is… bad? Stop.
DOCTOR: The technician will perform the tests and a radiologist will review the results. It usually takes a few days for the report to be sent to my office. I will contact you as soon as I have reviewed them and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. It’s unlikely they will give you a definitive diagnosis immediately, Mr. Vantine. The results need to be interpreted in the context of your overall health. I will also order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. That will help me determine the best course of action. Here is the referral for the imaging center. They will schedule the appointment for you. Do you have any questions before I conclude this visit?
PATIENT: Oh… a basic metabolic… panel. So many tests. No… I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Though… I suppose I'm a little worried. But… I trust you. Thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with an old man who forgets everything and sighs too much. And for the sliding scale. My wife… she’d be relieved. I think that’s all. I should probably be going. It’s getting late, I imagine. Thank you again, Doctor. Stop.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. Please, schedule those tests as soon as possible. And do try to rest. I will be in touch. Have a good day. Stop.
