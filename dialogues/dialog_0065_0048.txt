DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… troubling, really. My wife, she says I’ve been a bit… off. Losing my place, forgetting what I was doing mid-sentence. Little things, but enough to worry her. And frankly, enough to worry me, though I wouldn’t admit it easily. It's not like I'm senile or anything.
DOCTOR: “Off,” you say. And these episodes... can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Details? Hmm. Let me think. Just the other day, I was fixing the tile in the bathroom – a perfectly simple job, I've done it a hundred times – and I just… stopped. Stood there with the trowel in my hand, looking at the wall like I’d never seen one before. My wife had to come show me what I was doing. And then yesterday, I went to make coffee and… well, I put the sugar in the salt shaker. Small things, but they aren’t normal, are they? It’s irritating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Irritating, yes, and concerning enough to warrant a visit, which is good. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has this been building gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I’d say. It hasn’t been like… overnight. Maybe the last few months, I've noticed it creeping in. At first, I just chalked it up to getting older. You know, a little forgetfulness is to be expected. But it’s… more frequent now. And a bit more… disorienting, if that makes sense. It's not like I don't know what I'm doing, it's just… the thought doesn’t come as easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And beyond the memory issues and occasional disorientation, have you noticed any changes in your mood, your sleep, or your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite's been fine. Always enjoyed a good meal, still do. Sleep… well, I've always been a light sleeper. Wake up a few times a night, but nothing new there. As for mood… I get frustrated, naturally. Frustrated with myself, mostly. Losing my edge, you know? But I wouldn’t say I’m depressed or anything like that. More… annoyed. And my wife, she worries too much. That gets on my nerves sometimes. But that's just her nature.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Headaches, occasionally. Nothing severe. Just a little tension headache, usually after a long day working with tile. Vision… well, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that's true. Need my glasses, of course. No blurry vision or anything like that. And no weakness or numbness. I'm still strong as an ox, thank you very much. I’m a tile and stone setter, remember? Can’t be weak and wobbly.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Just a little ibuprofen sometimes for my back, after lifting heavy stones. And a multivitamin, my wife insists on it. Says I need to keep my strength up. I told her I eat plenty of rice, that’s good enough for me. But she worries… always worries. That’s about it, really. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have there been any changes in your family history recently – any new diagnoses of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions in your relatives?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a good question. My mother... she got a little forgetful towards the end, but we just put it down to old age, really. She lived a long life, though. Didn’t get any fancy diagnoses or anything. My father, he was always sharp as a tack, right up until the day he died. No, I don’t think so. Nothing new on that front. My sister, she's fine, lives in Phnom Penh. She's a teacher, always had a good memory for dates and names. No, not that I’m aware of. It's not something we really discuss in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about some potential causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It's unsettling. Do what you need to do. Though, if it’s nothing serious, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t make a big fuss. My wife will worry enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be thorough, but we don’t need to make anything more dramatic than it is. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and shoes, and I’ll start with a basic neurological assessment. We’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Then, a brief memory and cognitive screening test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Well, alright. It all sounds… a bit much, frankly. But I suppose you need to do what you need to do. Balance and coordination… that’s fine. I’ve been laying tile for forty years, I’m still steady on my feet. But please, don’t make me do anything silly. And go easy on the memory test. I’m not stupid, you know. Just a little… distracted lately.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. This is simply to gather information, to help us understand what might be going on. Nothing to worry about. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. But don’t poke and prod too much. I’ve got a job to get back to, you know. These homeowners… they’re relying on me. And I don’t want to be out of commission for long.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, a slightly prominent S1, but no murmurs, rubs or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respiratory effort appears normal. Now, let’s check your reflexes… please relax your arms. I’m going to gently tap on your tendons.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. But be gentle, please. I’m a bit ticklish, you know. And I don’t like being surprised. Just tell me what you’re doing before you… tap. It’s… unnerving, this whole thing. Not a fan of doctors, never have been. Always poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I'll explain everything as I go. Now, this is your bicep reflex. Just keep your arm relaxed... 2+ bilaterally. Now, let's check your patellar reflex… 2+ bilaterally. And finally, let's check your plantar reflex… Flexor response bilaterally. No clonus noted. Now, let’s do a quick balance test. Could you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Woah, steady now… This is a bit difficult, you know. I haven't stood like this in years. My wife says I wobble when I wash my hair, but I tell her she's exaggerating. Oh dear… See? I told you I wobble. Not good. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, sir. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsteady closing your eyes. It just helps us assess your balance. Let's try again, but you can hold onto the table if you'd like. Now, let’s do a very simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Three words. Go ahead. But don't make them too complicated, you hear? I'm not a scholar. Simple words. Easy words. Like… like tile, stone, and… and hammer. Yes, hammer. Those are good words. Simple. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Tile, stone, hammer. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions, then I’ll ask you to recall those three words again. What is today’s date, sir?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm… August… the second. Yes, the second of August. 2025. I think. Yes, 2025. My wife keeps a calendar, so I usually know. But… it’s a bit of a blur, honestly. I’ve been busy with the tiling job, haven’t had much time to think about dates.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where…? Oh, this is… a doctor’s office. Yes, a doctor's office. Dr. Duplichan's office. A… rural office, I believe. It's… not fancy, but it's clean. My wife wanted me to come here. Said I needed to get checked out. Yes, a rural doctor’s office. That’s where we are. But… what was I saying?
DOCTOR: You were doing very well, sir. Now, let’s see if you can recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Do you recall those words?
PATIENT: Three words… three words… Let me see… there was… tile, I think. Yes, tile. And… and something with stones. Stone, perhaps? But the third one… the third one is gone. Completely gone. Oh dear. I can’t remember. It’s… infuriating. I know I heard them. Tile… stone… and…? It’s on the tip of my tongue. But I just… can’t grasp it. I'm losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. It's alright. Memory can be a fickle thing. Based on the neurological exam and your recollection of events, I’m concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including cognitive testing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurologist, you say? More tests? Well, I suppose I have no choice. My wife will insist on it anyway. Yes, alright. Do what you need to do. But… please, don’t make me do anything silly. And… and tell me honestly, Doctor. Is it… bad? Am I losing my mind? Just tell me the truth. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: Sir, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. Based on the initial assessment, your symptoms do warrant further investigation. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, and it doesn't necessarily mean you're "losing your mind." Many factors can contribute to cognitive changes, and we need to rule out those possibilities first. The neurologist will conduct more in-depth testing to determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment, if needed. We'll have more answers after that evaluation. In the meantime, I will schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, and I will submit a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly respected neurologist in the area. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with a list of resources for patients with cognitive impairment and their families. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work tomorrow. Dr. Chen… I’ll trust your judgment. And the resources… yes, my wife will appreciate that. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I’ve always been a sharp man. Always been able to remember everything. Now… now I’m forgetting simple words. It's… humiliating. But alright. Do what you need to do. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being honest with me. Even if it’s not what I wanted to hear. Just… just promise me you’ll find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, sir. I promise we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the blood work and provide you with the necessary paperwork and resources. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… let me get home. Let me get back to work. Maybe if I keep busy, I won’t think about it so much. Yes. Just… let me get home. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. We’ll get you sorted out. My nurse will be with you in just a moment. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
