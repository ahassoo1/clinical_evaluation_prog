DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… pins and needles. I’m hoping you can figure out what it is. I need to get back to my route, if possible.
DOCTOR: Annoying is… a very diplomatic way to put it. Okay. "A little while now…" Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It comes and goes. Some days I don’t notice it at all, and other days… well, especially when I’m carrying those heavy bags of mail, it gets worse. It’s in both hands and both feet, not just one side. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Both hands and feet… alright. And heavier bags of mail makes it worse, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. When I have a really full bag, especially if it’s mostly those thicker magazines and catalogs, it feels… numb, almost. And the tingling gets sharper. It's hard to explain, but it's worse with the weight. I’ve just been trying to ignore it, honestly. But it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Ignoring things rarely makes them disappear. So, this is primarily noticed when you're… on your mail route, carrying the mail?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yes. I mean, I notice it sometimes when I’m just sitting around, but it’s nothing compared to when I’m working. It's definitely connected to being on my feet and carrying those bags. I’ve been doing this job for… oh, goodness, almost 40 years now. Never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: Forty years… that’s a long time doing the same work. Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really, no. I mean, I get tired, of course. It is a physically demanding job. But I haven't dropped anything or tripped or anything like that. My grip feels okay. I can still sort the mail fine, and I can still hold my coffee cup, if that makes sense. It's just… the tingling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant weakness, just the tingling… and it’s worse with exertion. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color?
PATIENT: Skin color? Oh… no, not that I’ve seen. I haven’t really looked at my skin color, to be honest. I do get cold easily, especially in the winter. But that’s just me. I’ve always been chilly. I don’t think my hands or feet look any different than usual. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have a lot of deliveries today.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Ms. Uzarski. Just trying to cover all the bases. Okay. Cold easily… alright. And have you had any recent injuries to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing at all. I mean, little bumps and bruises here and there, from walking and things, but nothing serious. I'm pretty careful, you know? I need my hands and feet for my job! I haven’t fallen or twisted anything. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to worry it's something…serious. But I just don’t have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Well, “serious” is a very broad term. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Could you sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think that’s best. I hope it doesn't take too long. I really need to get back to my route. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Hmm. Two plus bilaterally. Not bad. Now, let's check your sensation. Close your eyes. I'm going to touch your hands and feet with this. Tell me when you feel it. Alright… sensation is intact. And now, let's check your pulses. Pulses are a little diminished in your feet, but present. I'm going to check strength as well. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Strength is good. Now, try and push against my hand. Alright. Good strength there as well. Overall, your neurological exam is relatively normal, but the diminished pulses in your feet are a bit concerning.
PATIENT: Diminished pulses… that doesn't sound good. What does that mean? Is it my circulation? I don't smoke, and I try to eat okay. Is it something from walking so much? I just want to know what’s wrong, Doctor. And if I need to stop working. Because I don't know what I'd do if I couldn’t do my job.
DOCTOR: Well, diminished pulses could indicate some underlying circulatory issues. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. Given your history of walking long distances, it could be related to peripheral artery disease, or PAD. It's where the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet become narrowed, often due to plaque buildup. I'd like to order a simple test called an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. It compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It’s non-invasive and will give us a better idea of your circulation. We should also check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, just to rule out other potential causes. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce the amount of weight you’re carrying, if possible, and wear comfortable, supportive shoes. And please, don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: Okay… ABI… blood sugar… sounds like a lot of tests. Reducing the weight… well, that’s hard. They keep adding more and more to my route. But I’ll try. Comfortable shoes… I have good shoes. So, you think it could be something… serious? Like, will I have to stop working? That's my biggest worry, Doctor. I really need to know. And when can I get these tests done? I need to plan my schedule.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, it's too early to say definitively if you'll need to stop working. The ABI and blood tests will give us more information. It's possible this is just a circulatory issue related to your job, and we can manage it with lifestyle changes. It’s also possible it could be something more… serious. But jumping to conclusions won't help. I'm going to give you a referral to the lab across town. They can fit you in tomorrow morning. You don't need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Osterholm sent you. Here’s the requisition. We’ll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss a more concrete plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… alright. Well, I guess that's something. Lifestyle changes… I already walk a lot. What other changes? And… what if it is serious? What kind of treatment would I need? I just… I need to know what I'm facing. I've never been sick, Doctor. I’ve always been able to just… keep going. I really appreciate you trying to help, but I’m still very worried.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your anxiety. It’s never easy facing the unknown. As for treatment, if it is PAD, options range from medication to manage cholesterol and blood pressure, to lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and exercise, and in more severe cases, procedures to improve blood flow. We won't know until we get the test results. Look, I can't provide definitive answers right now. I’m not trying to minimize your concerns, but I also don’t want to alarm you unnecessarily. Let’s focus on getting these tests done. And if your symptoms worsen at all – if you experience pain in your legs or feet, or if you notice any skin changes – please call my office immediately. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, for now. One step at a time… alright. I’ll try. I really will. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I guess I’ll go home and try not to worry too much. One more thing… is it okay if I keep working until we get the results? I really need the money.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your need to work. Given your current symptoms, and the fact that you haven’t experienced any significant pain, it's probably okay to continue working, but please listen to your body. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, you need to stop immediately. And try to reduce the weight you’re carrying if possible. I'm happy to provide a note for your employer explaining you're undergoing testing. We'll get this figured out. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here's the note. Get some rest, and try not to stress too much. I’ll see you when the results come back. .
PATIENT: .
