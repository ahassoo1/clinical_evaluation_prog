DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Quicksey. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s a… a bit embarrassing, but I’ve been having a lot of gas. A lot. It’s causing me some discomfort, and I thought it best to get it checked. It’s been going on for… oh, I’d say about a month now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There’s no need to be embarrassed; digestive issues are quite common. It’s good you came in to discuss it. A month or so, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. About a month. It’s not… constant, you understand. More after I eat, usually. And some foods seem to make it worse than others, though I haven’t kept a strict record, if that makes sense. I eat… fairly normally, I think. Nothing too unusual.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. “Fairly normally” is a good start. Can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Let’s see… For breakfast, usually just toast and coffee. Sometimes an egg if I’m feeling energetic. Lunch is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, or turkey. Nothing fancy. And dinner… varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes a small piece of chicken with potatoes, sometimes just… leftovers. I do enjoy a biscuit with dinner, if I have one. I do like my biscuits, yes.
DOCTOR: Biscuits are good! No judgment here, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like a fairly standard diet. Now, you mentioned some foods seem to make the gas worse. Can you recall any specific foods that are particularly troublesome?
PATIENT: Hmm… beans, definitely beans. And cabbage. Cabbage is… not a friend, let’s say. Milk, too. A glass of milk will almost always cause… trouble. Though, I do enjoy a little yogurt sometimes, and that doesn’t bother me. It’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, both are dairy. I don't know. Perhaps it’s just certain kinds? I truly haven’t kept track, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s interesting – the difference between milk and yogurt is a good observation. It could be lactose intolerance, or it could be something else. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve been, thankfully, quite healthy most of my life. Just the usual colds, perhaps. I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but… nothing chronic. I do have Medicare, of course, but it's mostly for preventative things. I assure you, I’m generally a very healthy man for my age. This gas… it’s just… new.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it is helpful to know you’ve been generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. And no hospital stays, thankfully. I broke my arm as a child, a very silly accident involving a tree, but that was… a very long time ago. Nothing major, nothing requiring a hospital stay. I’ve always been quite careful, you see. A bit clumsy perhaps, but careful.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had… some stomach troubles when she was older. Indigestion, mostly. And my father… he had high blood pressure, but nothing related to… this. They are both… gone now, I’m afraid. No siblings, either. Just me. So, no family history of… excessive gas, if that's what you mean, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I keep a very clean life, you see. I believe in looking after myself.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking – including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. And occasionally, if my knees are acting up, I take some ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, of course. Nothing prescribed. And… that’s it, I believe, Doctor. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. A simple life, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten… all sorts of things in my life, traveled a bit, and never had an allergic reaction. I’ve seen bees, of course, but I’ve never been stung. I am quite fortunate, you see. A very resilient constitution, perhaps.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Goodstein. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and feel around a bit to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. Please, go right ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your bowel sounds are present, and within normal limits. They're not overly active or sluggish. Now I'm going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. There’s a little bit of tenderness in your lower left abdomen, but nothing acutely concerning. No masses or guarding. And finally, I'll percuss your abdomen. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but the tenderness warrants some further investigation.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, Doctor. I am glad it wasn't anything… serious. The tenderness… well, that is probably just from… something I ate, perhaps? I do sometimes overindulge in biscuits, as I mentioned. But if you think further investigation is needed, I certainly trust your professional opinion. What do you suggest?
DOCTOR: It could very well be something dietary, Mr. Goodstein, but given the duration of your symptoms and the tenderness, I’d like to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count – a CBC – to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying infection. I'm also going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel – a CMP – to assess your kidney and liver function and electrolyte balance. And finally, I'd like to check a stool sample for any parasites or bacteria. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. And sensible. I trust your judgment completely. A CBC, a CMP, and a stool sample… yes, let’s do all of that. If it helps you rule things out, I am happy to cooperate. It’s a bit… unpleasant, the stool sample, but… I understand it’s necessary. How do we go about doing these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern about the stool sample, Mr. Goodstein. It's not the most pleasant thing, but it’s a very helpful test. I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions for how to collect the sample at home. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully for accurate results. For the blood tests, we can draw the samples here in the clinic today. It will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss the findings and create a plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. Blood tests today, and a stool sample to collect at home… yes, I can certainly do that. Two to three business days… that is reasonable. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And your patience. I know I am not the easiest patient, always worrying and asking questions. But I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this gas, you see. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: You're not difficult at all, Mr. Goodstein. It’s my job to answer your questions and address your concerns. That’s what I’m here for. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. Alright, let's get the lab orders printed and get you set up with the collection kit for the stool sample. We'll get the blood draw done shortly. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is everything. You have been very helpful, and I appreciate your kindness and patience. The blood tests and the stool sample… yes, let’s proceed with those. I trust your judgment completely. Thank you again, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve put my mind at ease. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I will go and… avoid beans for a few days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a good plan, Mr. Goodstein. Avoiding beans is a wise decision. Let me have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and I’ll have her bring you the collection kit for the stool sample. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
