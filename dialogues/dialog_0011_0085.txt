DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's about my skin. It’s just… patchy, really. Not a nice colour, you understand. And it’s been getting… more noticeable. I’ve noticed it, and my husband has definitely noticed it. He has a very keen eye, thankfully. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concern, especially when a change is noticed by both yourself and your husband. “Patchy” and “not a nice colour” are helpful descriptions, but could you elaborate a bit more?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, I don't know what more there is to say. It’s… discoloured. Some areas are lighter than others. It's not a uniform tan, certainly. It’s… well, it’s just off. And it’s on my arms mostly, and a little on my chest. Not my face, thankfully. I would never… well, never mind. It’s just… unsightly. I’ve always taken such good care of my skin.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing it that way, Ms. Bartock. It’s helpful to understand your perspective, and that you’ve always been diligent about skincare. When did you first begin to notice these changes in skin colour?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started… probably around April, I would say. Yes, definitely April. We had a rather damp spring, and I suppose it could be from that? I mean, the humidity is dreadful. And I do garden, you know. Although I always wear a hat, and gloves… mostly. Perhaps it’s a bit of sun damage creeping up on me. It’s just… I'm careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, April is helpful to know. And you mentioned gardening, and wearing a hat and gloves. That's good preventative care. Besides the changes in colour, have you noticed any other changes to your skin – any itching, scaling, pain, blistering, or any changes in texture?
PATIENT: No, no itching. Absolutely not. Scaling? No, my skin is quite smooth, actually. I use a very good moisturizer. A Ukrainian brand, naturally. The best, you know. Pain? Definitely not. And blistering… heavens, no. Just… the colour. It’s really just that. It’s not rough, or uncomfortable. It’s… aesthetically displeasing. That’s the best way to put it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. That's helpful. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any skin conditions before, such as eczema, psoriasis, or vitiligo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that. My mother had… a bit of rosacea, I think, but that was all in her face. And she used far too much rouge, if you ask me. I’ve always been very healthy. Good constitution, you know. I eat very well – mostly Ukrainian cuisine, naturally – and I don’t go out in the sun unnecessarily. I can’t imagine having a skin condition. That’s… well, that’s just something other people get.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know you haven't had any previous skin diagnoses, and that your mother's rosacea was limited to her face. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, of course. A very common procedure back then. And… oh, and I had a rather nasty fall last year in the garden, tripped over a rose bush, and broke my wrist. But that’s it, really. Nothing serious. A very quick recovery, thankfully. My husband is very good at looking after me when I’m unwell. He’s a practical man.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. Tonsillectomy and a fractured wrist are noted. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of skin cancer, autoimmune diseases, or other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, well, my grandfather on my mother’s side… he had a bit of… a growth, I think. On his arm. They removed it, but I don’t know what it was. No one really talked about it. It was a long time ago, you understand. And… my aunt had rheumatoid arthritis, but that’s a joint problem, isn’t it? Not skin. Honestly, we don’t have a lot of… illness in my family. We’re a hardy people. Mostly just… sensible. Good food, fresh air, and a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. That information is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my joints, you understand. A vitamin D supplement, Doctor Neppl. The winters are so dark here, it’s just sensible to take one. And… sometimes a little ibuprofen if my wrist is acting up, but that’s very rare. Otherwise, no. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. My grandmother had all sorts of… concoctions. Very effective, you know. Mostly herbs and things from the garden.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen are noted. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies whatsoever. Not a one. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat, you understand. Fresh, natural ingredients. I can eat anything. And I haven’t had any trouble with medications, thankfully. My husband always double-checks everything, of course. He's very thorough. Honestly, I'm a very healthy person. It's just… this skin. It's really quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. That's a very complete history. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam to take a closer look at the affected areas?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Go ahead. I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? Though I’m sure you won’t find anything terribly… concerning. It’s probably just a bit of sun damage, despite my best efforts. But yes, please do have a look. I do hope it won’t take too long, though. I have a roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I will be as efficient as possible. Okay. I'm observing some areas of hypopigmentation – that is, areas of lighter skin colour – on your arms and chest, as you described. The patches are irregularly shaped and don’t appear to be raised or inflamed. The skin texture itself is normal, smooth, as you mentioned. There is no scaling, blistering, or evidence of active inflammation. I do not note any lymph node swelling in your armpits or neck. Based on this initial examination, the presentation is most consistent with pityriasis alba, a common skin condition often seen in younger individuals. It’s generally harmless and tends to resolve on its own over time, though it can sometimes take months or even years. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a potassium hydroxide preparation and a skin scraping to look for fungal infection, and a biopsy to rule out other conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Pityriasis… what did you say? And a what preparation? And… a biopsy? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… rather dramatic, doesn’t it? It’s just a bit of discoloured skin! My husband will be very concerned if you start talking about biopsies. Is that really necessary? I mean, couldn’t it just be… a vitamin deficiency? Or perhaps I need a different moisturizer? I really don’t want to go through a lot of… procedures, if it’s just something simple. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock, and I assure you, I wouldn’t suggest these tests lightly. “Pityriasis alba” simply means a mild scaling skin condition that causes patches of lightened skin. It’s not contagious and isn’t usually painful or itchy. However, while it is the most likely diagnosis based on my initial examination, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as fungal infection or, rarely, other skin conditions. A KOH preparation is a very simple test—we gently scrape a small sample of the affected skin and examine it under a microscope to look for fungus. It’s painless and doesn’t require any special preparation. A skin biopsy, while sounding more concerning, is also a relatively minor procedure. We take a very small sample of skin and send it to a pathologist for examination. It’s performed under local anesthesia, so you wouldn't feel any pain. It would help us to definitively rule out other conditions and ensure we are providing you with the most appropriate care. I understand your husband's concern is valid. Perhaps we can start with the KOH preparation to see if we can identify a fungal infection?
PATIENT: Oh… a fungal infection. That sounds… unpleasant. But not as dreadful as a… biopsy. Very well. If it’s just a simple… scraping, then I suppose that’s acceptable. But promise me, Doctor, if that’s negative, we won’t talk about any more… procedures. I really don’t want to put my husband through any unnecessary worry. He gets very… agitated, you see. He’s a very practical man, but not good with… medical things. And I’d really like to get the roast in the oven before it gets too late. So, yes. Let’s do the scraping. But that’s it. For now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns and I absolutely promise we will proceed cautiously and only as needed. We will start with the KOH preparation, and if the results are negative, we will discuss other options – or, more likely, simply observe the condition and see if it improves on its own, as pityriasis alba often does. Okay. This will just take a moment. I’m going to gently scrape a small sample of skin from one of the affected areas… this may feel a little like a light scratch. It shouldn’t be painful. Alright, I’ve collected the sample. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use a fragrance-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn’t involve any more… scraping, or… biopsies. And yes, fragrance-free moisturizer. I already use a very good one, naturally. And a follow-up appointment. Very well. I suppose that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I really must get home to check on the roast.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. I understand. We will proceed cautiously and keep you informed every step of the way. I’ve sent the lab order electronically, and my nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns. Have a pleasant day, and I hope your roast turns out beautifully. .
