DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is…August 2nd, yes? I am here because I need to know if my mother is able to receive care at home. She…she is not doing well, and I was told this clinic handles that sort of thing. A home health visit, or…hospice, if needed. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd. And yes, we do handle home health and can arrange hospice care if that becomes necessary. Though we always prefer patients come into the clinic, it’s much easier to get a proper assessment that way. Still, we can work with the situation. First, tell me about your mother. What's going on that's led you to believe she needs this level of care?
PATIENT: Well, her name is Simone Bahta. She is 87 years old. For the past…oh, I would say six months now, she has been getting weaker. She used to be very independent, you see. But she falls often, even with a walker. And she…she forgets things. Not just where she put her keys, but important things. She gets confused easily, and sometimes doesn’t recognize me. It is…difficult to watch. She also has very little appetite. She barely eats anything, and when she does, it is only small portions. She mostly just sleeps now. Is that…enough information? I can provide more details, of course. I remember everything quite clearly.
DOCTOR: Right. Simone Bahta, 87. Falling, memory loss, decreased appetite, increased sleeping... Yes, that's a start. "Forgetting things" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Bahta. We need specifics. Let's start with the falls. How many falls in the last six months?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, specifics. You are quite right, Doctor. I apologize. Let me think… There have been, I believe, seven falls in the past six months. The first two were minor, just stumbling, she didn't injure herself. But the last five… she has needed assistance to get up each time. One time, she fractured her wrist. It was a small fracture, but it required a cast. And just last week, she bumped her head rather badly. I rushed her to the hospital, and they did a scan, thankfully no bleeding, but she was very shaken. It is…worrying. She refuses to use a cane, says it makes her feel “old”. It is…stubbornness, I think.
DOCTOR: Seven falls… and a refusal to use assistive devices despite a fractured wrist and a head injury. That’s…concerning. And what about the confusion?
PATIENT: It is…difficult to explain. It isn't constant. Sometimes she is perfectly lucid, and we can have a normal conversation. But other times… she will ask the same question repeatedly, even if I just answered it. Or she will think I am someone else. Her brother, mostly. He passed away ten years ago. She also gets…disoriented. She doesn’t always know what day it is, or where she is. Just last night, she thought she was at her childhood home, which is several towns away. She gets agitated easily when I try to correct her. It is… upsetting for both of us. Do you need me to provide dates for these instances, Doctor? I can certainly do that. I keep a journal.
DOCTOR: A journal. How… thorough. Dates would be helpful, yes. Though frankly, a pattern of disorientation and repetitive questioning sounds like cognitive decline, which, at her age, isn’t entirely unexpected. Still, we need to rule out other causes. Has she been diagnosed with anything previously?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, she has. She was diagnosed with high blood pressure about twenty years ago, and she takes medication for that. She also had a mild stroke about fifteen years ago, but she recovered well, with no lasting effects…or so we thought. The doctor at the time said it was a “warning sign”, but she was otherwise healthy for many years after. And…she has arthritis, in her hands and knees. It causes her a lot of pain, and she takes medication for that as well. She saw a specialist for that about five years ago. I believe she also had a bout of pneumonia last winter, but she recovered from that as well. I have all of her medical records at home, if you would like to see them. I can bring them in next time. Do you require them immediately, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Records would be useful, eventually. Though let’s focus on current medications for now. What is she currently taking, and what are the dosages?
PATIENT: Let me see… She takes Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And she takes…Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day for the arthritis pain. Also, she has a medication for sleep, Trazodone, 50 milligrams, as needed, but she only takes it occasionally, when she is particularly restless. And…oh, she also takes a daily multivitamin, but that is over-the-counter, so I don't know the specific dosage. I believe it is one tablet per day. She gets all of her prescriptions filled at the pharmacy on Elm Street. I can provide you with the pharmacy’s contact information if you wish. I believe that is everything, Doctor. I try to keep track of her medication schedule carefully, as she sometimes forgets to take her pills. It is…a responsibility.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, Naproxen, Trazodone as needed, multivitamin. We'll need to review the potential interactions with any cognitive decline. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Can she stand on her own?
PATIENT: Yes, she can stand on her own, but only for a short period. She gets very unsteady and requires assistance to sit back down. She often uses the wall for support, and she shuffles her feet when she walks. She also complains of dizziness sometimes, especially when she stands up quickly. I worry about her falling again. She does not have any pain when she walks, other than the occasional ache in her knees from the arthritis. And she…she does not have any numbness or tingling in her hands or feet. I make sure to check that regularly. She often complains of being cold, even when the room is warm. I believe that is all, Doctor. Would you like me to demonstrate her walking for you? I can have her stand up and take a few steps. It might be easier to assess that way.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Have her stand. Slowly. And take a few steps, if she’s able. I want to see her gait and balance. And I will check her blood pressure while she is standing. It's important to rule out orthostatic hypotension.
PATIENT: Alright, Mama, slowly now. Just a few steps. That’s it… good. Very good. Careful, careful… Yes, you are doing well. Just a little further… And stop now, rest now. You see, Doctor? She is very unsteady. She needs a lot of support, and she gets very tired quickly. She is reluctant to walk without assistance, as she is afraid of falling. As for her blood pressure, I have not checked it recently. I do not have the equipment at home. But I can ask her if she feels dizzy when she stands up. She often complains of lightheadedness, but she usually attributes that to being tired. She says it is… a part of getting older.
DOCTOR: Right. Unsteady gait, reports dizziness. Blood pressure needs to be checked, and we’ll need to assess her reflexes. Please have her sit back down. Okay. Sitting blood pressure is 148/82. Standing blood pressure… 132/78. Slight drop, but not significant enough to explain everything. Patellar reflexes… 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes… 1+ bilaterally. Dorsiflexion… weak on the left, normal on the right. Weak dorsiflexion on the left could indicate a nerve issue. But overall, the physical exam isn’t definitive. We need some bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I want to rule out a urinary tract infection. I will order a urine analysis as well.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork, a urine analysis… I will schedule an appointment for her with the lab as soon as possible. Is there anything else I should do? Any specific instructions I should follow before the bloodwork? She is…sometimes anxious about medical procedures. I try to reassure her, but it is…difficult. She has always been a bit of a worrier. And…when will the results be available? I understand these things take time, but I am…eager to know what is causing her problems. I want to help her as much as possible. I just want to know what is happening to my mother.
DOCTOR: Yes, anxiety is common. Explain to her it's routine. Fasting bloodwork; no food for 12 hours beforehand. Hydrate, but not immediately before the draw. Results usually take 3-5 business days. I'll have the lab fax them to me directly. In the meantime, continue to monitor her for any changes – increased confusion, new falls, fever, difficulty urinating. Honestly, Mr. Bahta, at her age, some decline is expected. But we’ll rule out anything treatable. And frankly, if it is significant cognitive decline, you need to prepare for long-term care. Assisted living, or… other options. It's a difficult conversation, I know, but it's one you need to have. Do you understand everything?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Fasting bloodwork, monitor for changes, prepare for…other options. Assisted living… I see. It is…difficult to think about. She has always been so independent. The thought of her needing… assistance… it is… upsetting. But I will do what is best for her, of course. So, to be clear, the bloodwork and urine analysis will help determine if there is a medical cause for her symptoms? And if those tests are normal… then we will discuss… long-term care options? Is that correct, Doctor? I just want to be sure I understand everything completely. I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Precisely. The bloodwork rules out infections, metabolic imbalances, thyroid issues. All things that can mimic cognitive decline. If those are normal… it strongly suggests a neurological process. Dementia, Alzheimer’s… that sort of thing. We’ll discuss the results when they come back. And I will refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation if necessary. And I’ll provide you with resources for long-term care. Assisted living facilities, in-home care… the options are out there. Right now, focus on getting the bloodwork done. That's the most important thing. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have answered all of my questions. Thank you for your time. And…thank you for being honest with me. It is…difficult to hear, but I appreciate your candor. I will schedule the bloodwork as soon as possible. And I will…prepare for the next steps. Thank you again, Doctor. .
