DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Um… it is… the words. They are… not coming so easy. It is… difficult. I know I have trouble, yes. It is… frustrating, to be honest. I forget things, too, but this is… different.
DOCTOR: Right. “Words not coming easy.” Okay. So you're experiencing difficulty finding words, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… good way to put it. Finding them. Like they are… hiding. Not gone, but… not here when I need them. Sometimes, I know what I want to say, but… it comes out… wrong. Or not at all. It is… a little scary, to be honest. I am a… Compensation man, yes? I need words for my job.
DOCTOR: A "Compensation man?
PATIENT: Yes. Compensation, Benefits, and… Job Analysis. I help people with their work things. Money, and… what they do. But… it is hard to explain when the words… you understand? It is very frustrating. I am Sherrell Gyamfi. I am… widowed, yes. It has been some time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I see a bit about your profession here. Benefits and job analysis… requires communication. We’ll get to the bottom of this. So, when did you first start noticing this difficulty with finding words?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. It was… not sudden. More like… slow. Months, perhaps? Maybe… six months ago? It started small. Forgetting a name here or there. But it has… grown. Now, it is… often. Especially when I am… tired. Or stressed. It is difficult to say exactly when. My memory… is not what it was. It is… a little embarrassing, yes?
DOCTOR: Six months… progressive difficulty, worse with fatigue or stress. Alright. Are you experiencing any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it purely with expressing yourself?
PATIENT: No, no. I understand… what people say. Usually. Sometimes, if they speak very fast, I need them to… repeat it. But… no. The understanding is… okay. It is… saying it. Getting the thought… from my head… to my mouth. That is the trouble. It is like… a blockage, yes? A little scary. I have Medicare, yes? For insurance.
DOCTOR: Right, Medicare. I see that. So, just to clarify – you don't have trouble understanding conversations, it's the production of speech. And it’s worse when you’re tired or stressed. Have you noticed if it’s worse at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. Let me… think. I am not sure. Perhaps… in the afternoon? When I have been… working hard? But it is… difficult to say. I do my work… when I can. Sometimes, I take naps. It helps… a little. I am a… tall man. Very tall. Two meters, perhaps? It is… hard to think. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: Two meters… alright. Look, let’s try to be as precise as possible here. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… let me think. I… sometimes feel a little… dizzy? But not often. And my… hands shake a little. But I thought that was just… old age. It is… difficult. I am not sure what is important. I try to… eat well. And get some exercise. But… it is not always easy. I am… widowed, yes? It has been a long time. It is… lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, hand tremors… alright. And you said you've noticed these symptoms for about six months as well?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. The dizziness… not every day. Perhaps… once a week? And the shaking… sometimes when I am… reaching for something. Or writing. It is… small. Not big shaking. Just… a little tremor. It is… difficult to explain. I am a… Compensation man, yes? I need my hands to do my job. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… had my blood pressure checked… a few years ago. The doctor said it was… a little high. But he… gave me some pills. I took them for a while. But… I stopped. They made me… tired. I do not… think I have diabetes. I do not… eat much sugar. I am… a tall man, yes? Two meters, perhaps? It is… hard to remember. It was a long time ago. My wife… she took care of these things.
DOCTOR: You were prescribed medication for high blood pressure and stopped taking it?
PATIENT: Yes. The doctor… he said it was… important to take it. But it made me… feel unwell. Very tired. And I… I did not see a big difference. So I stopped. It was… a long time ago. Perhaps… five years? It is… difficult to remember exactly. My wife… she would remind me of these things. But… she is gone now. It is… lonely sometimes. I am a Compensation man, yes? It is… hard to concentrate when I am feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Discontinuing prescribed medication is… not advisable. Alright. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I do not… think so. I had my… gallbladder removed many years ago. But that was… a long time ago. And… I sometimes get a little… pain in my back. But I think it is just… old age. I am… a tall man, yes? It is… hard on my back. Two meters, perhaps? It is… difficult to remember everything. I try to… stay active. But… it is not always easy. I am a Compensation man, yes? It is… worrying to feel unwell. I need my… memory for my job.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… alright. Let’s talk about family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, my parents… they are both gone now. Many years ago. My mother… she died of… I think it was… cancer. Lung cancer. My father… he died of… heart problems. I think. It was a long time ago. I… do not remember much detail. My wife… she knew all these things. It is… difficult to remember everything. I am a Compensation man, yes? It is… worrying to feel unwell. It affects my job. I need to be sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I… sometimes take a pill for… my water. For my bladder. It is… a small pill. I get it from the… pharmacy. And… sometimes, when my back hurts, I take… ibuprofen. A small dose. That is… all. I think. It is… difficult to remember. My wife… she would remind me of these things. It is… lonely sometimes. I am a Compensation man, yes? I need my… memory for my job. I am… a tall man, perhaps two meters?
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. I’ve gathered enough information for now. We’ll do a brief physical exam, and then discuss some potential causes for your symptoms. But I have to be frank - stopping your blood pressure medication was… unwise. Now, if you could just follow me to the examination room…
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I… apologize for my forgetfulness. I did not… realize it was so important. I am sorry. I will… try to remember everything you say. Yes. Follow you… to the examination room. It is… difficult to think clearly sometimes. I am… a Compensation man, yes? And I… need my memory for my job. It is… worrying. Yes. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Let’s go. Please, sit on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. The… examination table. Right. Blood pressure. Yes. I hope it is… not too high. It has been… a while since I had it checked. I am… a tall man, you know. Perhaps that affects it. Yes. Please… proceed, Doctor. I will… try to be still. It is… difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hold still. And try to relax. Hmm. 160 over 95. Elevated. As I suspected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Deep breath… in… and… out. 160 over 95… I see. Elevated. I… apologize for that. I… stopped taking the pills. It made me… tired. I… should not have done that, I suppose. It is… difficult sometimes to know what is best. Is everything… alright?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds a bit… strained. And I’m detecting a slight… asymmetry in your lung sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. 2+ reflexes bilaterally. Normal. Now, the other side…
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Strained… asymmetry… 2+ reflexes… Is that… normal? I… apologize for my ignorance. It is… difficult to understand all these things. My wife… she would explain it to me. I… miss her very much. Is something… seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: "Seriously wrong" is a strong term. However, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and the asymmetry in your lung sounds is concerning. Coupled with your report of memory problems, dizziness, and tremors, it suggests a possible… vascular issue. It could be a number of things, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work, an EKG, and a CT scan of your brain. And I strongly recommend you start taking medication to control your blood pressure immediately.
PATIENT: Vascular… issue? Blood work… EKG… CT scan…? Is it… serious? Is it… life-threatening? And the… medication? What kind of… medication? Will it make me… tired again? I… apologize for my questions. It is… difficult to process all this information. I… just want to be… alright. What do you… think is wrong?
DOCTOR: Look, Sherrell. I'm not going to speculate. We need the test results. But uncontrolled hypertension – high blood pressure – can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure… so yes, it’s serious. The medication I’m prescribing is a low dose, and we can adjust it if you experience side effects. The CT scan will help rule out any structural issues in your brain that could be causing your symptoms. You’ll need to schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. And please, make an appointment with a cardiologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stroke… heart attack… Cardiologist… I… I understand. But… it is all so much. I… I don’t know if I can… do all this. Could… could you explain it to me… one more time? Slowly? I… I just want to understand what… what is happening. It is… difficult. Very difficult. I… miss my wife so much. She would… she would know what to do.
DOCTOR: Look, Sherrell. We’ve been over this. Your blood pressure is dangerously high. Your symptoms could be related. We need to rule out serious causes like stroke or a brain tumor. The tests will give us answers. I’m a doctor, not a miracle worker. I can order tests and prescribe medication. I can't hold your hand through this. The cardiologist will explain the specifics of heart health, and the neurologist will assess your brain. Here's the contact information for both specialists. I suggest you schedule appointments immediately. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… no further questions. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will schedule the appointments. I… I just want to be… alright. .
DOCTOR: .
