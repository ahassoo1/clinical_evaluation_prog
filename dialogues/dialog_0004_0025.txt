DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to know… about my people. Where they come from, long time ago. My daughter, she buy me this test… DNA test, she call it. She say it tell you where your family from. I want to know if you can help me with it?
DOCTOR: A DNA test…to determine your ancestry?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That’s right. She say it good test. But I need… someone to look at the paper when it come. I no good with… numbers and all that. She say you can help me understand. I make little boats, you see? Wood boats. Not good with paper.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I’m a physician. I specialize in internal medicine – treating illnesses, managing chronic conditions. While I appreciate your daughter’s thoughtfulness, interpreting ancestry reports isn’t really within my scope of practice. It’s more of a genetic counseling or… historical research area, frankly. However, I can certainly look at the report with you, but I won’t be able to provide a detailed analysis or medical interpretation. I’m just not qualified to do so. It appears you are primarily interested in your heritage. Have you considered contacting a genealogist?
PATIENT: Gene… a… logist? What that do? I just want to know where my family come from. Long, long time ago. Before the islands… before everything. My daughter, she say this test can tell. You can’t read the paper? Just tell me what it say? Is it hard?
DOCTOR: A genealogist specializes in tracing family histories. They research records, documents… things like that. Look, Mr. Scobie, these tests can be… imprecise. They provide estimates based on comparisons, and the results aren't always definitive. And frankly, I’m concerned we’re straying from any actual medical issues you may be experiencing. Is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, no medical. Just this paper. My daughter say you smart. You read lots of paper. I not good at reading. I make boats. Beautiful boats! But paper… no. Is okay if you just look quick? Just tell me if it say I come from… I don’t know… other islands? Or… America? She say maybe America.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, I am concerned about the focus on this report when you haven't presented any medical concerns. However… fine. If you insist, I will glance at the report when it arrives. But I must reiterate, I’m not equipped to provide a comprehensive interpretation. And I strongly suggest you consult with a professional genealogist for a thorough analysis. Do you have the report with you today, or is it still coming?
PATIENT: It still coming, Doctor. She send it in the mail. Maybe two, three days. I bring it next time. You promise you look quick? Just tell me… big places? Where my people maybe from?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I promise I'll take a quick look when you bring it in. But I want to be clear: I’m a physician, not a historian. I can't guarantee I'll be able to tell you much beyond what’s written on the report itself. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medicine. Just… old. And no allergies. I eat everything. Fish, coconut… everything. My daughter, she worry about me getting sick, but I strong. I make boats, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: No changes. Same old. Sometimes… little tired. But that’s just old, I think. I sleep good though. Lots of sleep. And I eat. Always eat.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain. Sometimes… my back, when I bend to work on the boats. But just a little. Nothing bad. I rub it with coconut oil. That’s good.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Huh? Bowel… what? You mean… going to the bathroom? Is okay. Regular. I eat lots of coconut. That helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, “regular.” Good. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No changes. I always eat good. Maybe a little more coconut lately, because my daughter send me lots. She worry about me. But I strong. I no skinny.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. Well, it sounds like you’re doing relatively well, despite your age. We’ll keep an eye on things. Remember to bring in that ancestry report next time, and we'll take a brief look at it. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For looking at the paper. And for not laughing at my boats. My daughter say you smart. I think I go home now. Make more boats.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Scobie. Have a good day. And please, do come back if anything changes. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
