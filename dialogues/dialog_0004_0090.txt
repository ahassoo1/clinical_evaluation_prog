DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I believe it’s a clearance visit? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that is. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. I apologize if I seem a little lost.
DOCTOR: A surgery clearance… right. It is best to have a clear understanding before proceeding with anything like that. Let’s try to untangle this “fuzziness,” shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. I… I remember my husband and I discussed it, a long time ago now. He was very supportive. But… the details escape me. I think it’s cosmetic, something I’ve wanted for quite a while. But what exactly… I couldn’t say for certain. I’m so sorry. Is it alright if we start with general health questions, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. We can certainly start with a general health assessment. It's not uncommon for details to become blurred, especially with something planned over time. Let's begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe I’m generally quite healthy. My husband always said I was… robust. I don't recall any specific diagnoses, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing… serious. I did have a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… regular checkups, of course. Though where with whom… that's another thing I'm struggling with.
DOCTOR: "Robust" is… reassuring, I suppose. Though, as you said, details are important. Any hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… Oh, dear. Now that you mention it… yes. After my husband passed, I was… unwell. Very unwell. I was in the hospital for a time. It was… difficult. It wasn't a physical illness, not exactly. More… emotional. I received care, of course. But I honestly don’t remember the specifics – the hospital’s name, the length of stay, the exact treatments… it’s all quite hazy. I’m terribly sorry for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. A period of hospitalization following your husband’s passing, primarily for emotional distress. It’s understandable that details would be difficult to recall during such a time. Do you recall if you saw a psychiatrist or therapist during that time, or were you prescribed any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I remember a very kind woman… Dr. Ramirez, I think. She helped me tremendously. And… yes, I was prescribed something. A small, white pill. It helped me sleep, mostly. And… calm my nerves. I continued taking it for a while, but I’ve been off of it for… a long time now. Several years, at least. I don’t recall the name of the medication, unfortunately. It was just… something Dr. Ramirez prescribed.
DOCTOR: A small, white pill prescribed by Dr. Ramirez for sleep and anxiety. We’ll need to try and obtain those records. Now, let's move on to surgical history. Have you ever undergone any surgeries prior to this potential procedure?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh… goodness. That’s another difficult one. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. That’s… that’s the only one I’m certain of. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth removed as well, but that feels… less clear. Everything is so mixed up. I don't believe I've had any other surgeries. Not as an adult, certainly. Though… please forgive me, I’m really trying to remember. It’s just… incredibly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Tonsillectomy as a child, possible wisdom teeth removal. We’ll confirm this with records when we obtain them. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And she was… careful with her diet, always watching her salt intake. My father… he was a very strong man, but he had some trouble with his heart later in life. Nothing… dramatic, but he wasn’t as active as he once was. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had diabetes. I believe that was Type 2. It was… a long time ago, and my Spanish isn't very good, so I’m afraid my recollection is a little fuzzy. I apologize again for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, Type 2 diabetes in your grandmother. That's helpful, though more specifics would be ideal. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. My husband… he always said it was a terrible habit. I’ve always avoided it. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, actually. It helps me relax. Do you need to know about… other habits? I'm… I'm hoping I'm not being a nuisance. I just want to be perfectly clear about everything.
DOCTOR: "Other habits" refers to recreational drug use, Ms. Brightful. It is a standard question. No, I assure you, you are not being a nuisance. However, complete transparency is vital. Have you ever used any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, never. Absolutely not. I… I’ve always considered that a very… unhealthy path. My upbringing was… quite strict, actually. It was always emphasized the importance of a clean and virtuous life. No, Doctor, I have never used any recreational drugs. I assure you. It’s… it’s quite a shock that you even asked.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, thankfully, no. I don’t have any known allergies. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully – I enjoy cooking, you see. And I haven't had any reactions to any medications in the past. Though… I suppose it's always possible I've forgotten something. It’s just… everything is so hazy these days. Is it alright if I ask what sort of surgery we're discussing? Perhaps knowing the details will help me recall more information.
DOCTOR: We are scheduled to review you for elective abdominoplasty, Ms. Brightful. You are requesting a tummy tuck. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Abdominoplasty… yes, that sounds right. My husband and I discussed it… a long time ago. Medications… let me see. As I mentioned earlier, I was taking something for sleep, prescribed by Dr. Ramirez, but I stopped taking it several years ago. Other than that… no. Nothing at all. Just my regular chamomile tea. I take it every evening before bed. Is that alright? Does chamomile tea interfere with anything?
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is… unlikely to interfere with anything. However, it is important to be thorough. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I understand. Please, go ahead. I… I’m ready when you are. I just hope I can be helpful. Everything feels so… disjointed, and I truly want to make sure everything goes smoothly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Please have a seat on the table. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen. Please disrobe from the waist up and put on a gown.
PATIENT: Of course. It’s… a little chilly in here, isn’t it? I hope I’m not being… difficult. I just… I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender. No palpable masses. There's some mild laxity of the abdominal skin, consistent with previous pregnancy, which you've likely noted. BMI is 36.7, indicating obesity. We’ll need to discuss the implications of this before proceeding.
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a little sensitive, actually. But I think that’s just because… well, I’ve always been a bit… self-conscious about my stomach. A BMI of… 36.7? Does that mean… does that mean I’m not a good candidate? I… I was hoping to finally feel better about myself, you see. I've always wanted this, and the idea of not being able to proceed… it’s quite disheartening.
DOCTOR: A BMI over 30 is considered obese, Ms. Brightful. While surgery can be performed, it significantly increases the risk of complications—infection, hematoma, poor wound healing. We would need to obtain a letter from your primary care physician stating that you are medically cleared for surgery, and you would be strongly advised to lose weight before proceeding. Furthermore, a psychological evaluation is warranted given your history of emotional distress and expressed body image concerns. I'm not saying it’s impossible, but it requires careful consideration and a realistic understanding of the risks involved. Do you have a primary care physician we can contact?
PATIENT: A psychological evaluation… oh dear. I… I hadn't anticipated that. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. A primary care physician… that’s… difficult. My husband always handled those things. After he passed… I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly. I… I vaguely remember a Dr. Silva, perhaps? But I don’t have her contact information. And I’m not even certain she’s still practicing. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? I just want to feel like myself again. It's… very important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the lack of a primary care physician and the history of emotional distress, a referral to a physician for a comprehensive medical evaluation and psychological assessment is mandatory before we can even consider proceeding with surgery. I will provide you with a list of qualified practitioners in the area. You will need to schedule appointments with both a medical doctor and a psychologist. Once you have received their evaluations, then we can reassess your candidacy. I understand this is not what you wanted to hear, Ms. Brightful. However, your safety and well-being are my primary concern. We cannot simply ignore potential risks.
PATIENT: I… I understand. You’re right, of course. Safety first. It’s just… so disappointing. I had such high hopes. Thank you for being honest with me, though. I appreciate that. Could you… could you please tell me what I should expect during these evaluations? What sort of questions will they ask? I… I just want to be prepared. It’s… it’s a little frightening, going to these appointments alone.
DOCTOR: The medical evaluation will be a standard physical exam, blood work to assess your overall health and identify any underlying medical conditions. They will likely discuss your medical history, current medications, and lifestyle habits. The psychological evaluation will focus on your emotional state, body image concerns, and any history of depression or anxiety. They will likely ask about your reasons for wanting the surgery, your expectations, and your coping mechanisms. They may also administer questionnaires or psychological tests. Be honest with them, Ms. Brightful. Transparency is crucial. They are there to help you determine if you are emotionally prepared for the surgery and to address any underlying issues that may impact your recovery. Here is the list of practitioners. I recommend scheduling these appointments as soon as possible. And remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns. While this may seem daunting, taking these steps is vital for ensuring a safe and successful outcome.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. I… I will schedule the appointments. As soon as possible. I… I appreciate your honesty and your kindness. I think… I think that’s all. I… I don’t want to take up any more of your time. Goodbye, Doctor.
