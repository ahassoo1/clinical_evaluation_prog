DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Hmm… what brings me in… Yes. It is… the words. They… they do not come so easy now. It is very strange. I forget… what I want to say, you know? It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words, and it's been a recent change. That can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this?
PATIENT: Noticed… when? Oh, dear. It is… a little while now, I think. Maybe… a few months? It is hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Some days are better than others, but… it is always there, in the back of my mind. I worry… I used to be very good with words. My job… Compensation, Benefits… it requires very precise language. Now… now I struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few months of intermittent difficulty, with some days being better than others, and a worry that it’s impacting your work… that's helpful information. And your work requiring precise language certainly makes this more noticeable. To get a clearer picture, could you describe how the difficulty manifests?
PATIENT: How it… shows itself? Yes. It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue, you know? I know what I want to say. I can… feel it. But when I try to say it… it is… gone. Or I say the wrong word. A similar word, but… not quite right. It is very frustrating. And sometimes… sometimes I just… stop. Completely blank.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like word-finding difficulty – the word is there, but not accessible, and you sometimes substitute the wrong word or have a complete block. That’s very helpful to know. To help me rule out different possibilities, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. My wife… she always handled those things. I remember… a little bit of high blood pressure, maybe? Years ago. Nothing serious, I think. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. But nothing else… I don’t think. It is very difficult to recall, Doctor. I am… getting older, you know? Things… slip away.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in the past and an appendectomy – thank you for letting me know. It’s perfectly normal for things to be less clear as we get older. Were you taking any medications for your blood pressure, or are you currently taking any other medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. For the blood pressure. Years ago, a small white pill. I cannot remember the name. And… now? Let me see… just a vitamin D supplement. My wife… she said I was lacking. I take one tablet each morning with breakfast. That is all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a vitamin D supplement daily. That's good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My balance… it has not been as good lately. I nearly fell last week, reaching for a book. And… sometimes I feel a little tired. More tired than usual, you know? But… that could just be my age. I do not sleep as well as I once did. And… … sometimes my head feels… foggy. Not a headache, exactly. Just… not quite clear.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Balance issues, increased fatigue, and a feeling of fogginess alongside the word-finding difficulty are all important pieces of the puzzle. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… yes. My mother… she was very healthy, lived to be 90. My father… he had some problems with his memory later in life. Not… not like me, I do not think. More… forgetting where he put things. My sister… she is still alive, healthy as can be. She lives in Germany. I have not seen her in many years. It is difficult to recall much else, Doctor. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A healthy mother, a father with some later-life memory issues – primarily misplacing things – and a healthy sister. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I do not drink alcohol. My wife… she did not approve. And I have never smoked. Always thought it was a foolish habit. And… no, certainly not any… recreational drugs. I am a simple man, you see. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open. That’s very good to know. To continue, have you experienced any recent head trauma or injuries?
PATIENT: Head trauma… no. Not that I recall. I… I bumped my head a little when I was moving some boxes last month, but nothing serious. Just a small bump. No bleeding, no dizziness. I do not think it is related to the words, Doctor. Just… a clumsy moment. I am not as agile as I once was, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A minor bump to the head a month ago, but nothing significant. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I do not think so. I can eat most things. I have never had a reaction to any medication. My wife… she always checked. She was very careful. I believe I am generally… allergy-free, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No known allergies. Now, to help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination… yes, of course. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to understand what is happening with the words. If an examination will help, please proceed.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 76, and temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Your reflexes are within normal limits. I notice a slight unsteadiness when you perform a tandem walking test. It's subtle, but present. Your cranial nerves are intact. You recall two out of three words immediately, and perform the calculations with some difficulty. Based on the examination, there’s some mild unsteadiness and slight difficulty with immediate recall. These findings, combined with your symptoms, suggest we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further… yes. That sounds… sensible. What sort of investigation, Doctor? Is it… serious? I am a little worried now. It is… unsettling to think something might be wrong. The words… they are very important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s perfectly natural to be worried when you're experiencing changes like this. At this point, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for common causes of cognitive difficulties, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and infections. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help us rule out any structural issues. The MRI is the most important next step. It will give us a lot more information. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it's important to investigate thoroughly to get an accurate diagnosis. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds reasonable. I do not mind a little blood being taken. An MRI… hmm. That sounds… more serious. Is it… painful? And will it take long? I have an appointment with my… with the book club next week, and I would not want to miss it. But if it is necessary to understand the words, then yes. I will proceed. Please tell me more about it. What will it involve?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the MRI, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s completely normal to feel apprehensive. The MRI itself is not painful at all. You’ll lie down on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It’s a bit noisy – it makes a thumping and clicking sound – and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We’ll give you earplugs to help with the noise. There are some contraindications - things that would prevent you from having an MRI - such as having certain metal implants. But based on what you've told me, I don't believe that will be an issue. As for missing your book club appointment, we can schedule the MRI for a time that minimizes disruption. I’ll have my assistant contact you to arrange a convenient time. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – for a consultation. They’ll be able to review the results of the tests and provide a more detailed assessment. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes. A specialist sounds… good. The more eyes looking at this, the better. The MRI… 30-45 minutes, you say? And no pain? That is… reassuring. As long as I can still attend the book club meeting… Yes. Please schedule it carefully. We are discussing a particularly interesting novel, you see. And I would not want to miss the discussion. Yes. Proceed with the tests and the neurologist. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule the MRI and the neurologist appointment. In the meantime, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, vision changes, or severe headaches, please contact the office immediately. We will get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have answered all my questions very thoroughly. I am… grateful for your time and attention. And… thank you again for explaining everything so patiently. I feel… a little less anxious now. I will await my assistant's call. And I will contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to hear. Here is a summary of our plan. We are ordering blood tests and scheduling an MRI of your brain. I am also referring you to a neurologist for a consultation. My assistant will contact you to arrange the appointments. Here is a printed summary of these instructions for your reference. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I shall await your assistant’s call. Have a good day.
