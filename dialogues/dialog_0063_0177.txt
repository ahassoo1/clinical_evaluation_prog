DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Genard. I am Dr. Jules. Now, I understand you’re here today seeking medical attention. Could you please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a problem. A private problem. Honestly, I don't like talking about this. But it’s… leaking. Down there. It’s been happening a little while now, I think. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It's… icky.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. “Leaking,” you say. I assure you, Mrs. Genard, we deal with these… delicate issues frequently. It’s hardly remarkable. Now, let’s attempt some precision. When did you first notice this “leaking”?
PATIENT: Precision? Oh, goodness. I don’t do precision. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days, you know? Let me think… It was… after the fiesta, maybe? Or before? Everything blurs together after a while. A few months, I guess. Could be longer. Time just slips away. It wasn’t constant, not at first. Just… now and then.
DOCTOR: A “few months.” Yes, well. Vague recollections are… unhelpful, Mrs. Genard. Is it associated with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Activity? What kind of activity? Oh… you mean that kind of activity? Well… I’ve been mostly by myself lately. Not much… company. No, it doesn’t seem to happen after anything special. Just… happens. Sometimes when I’m just sitting, sometimes when I walk… it’s very unpredictable. Honestly, it's embarrassing to even talk about it.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, you say. And has there been any change in the… volume of this leakage?
PATIENT: Volume? Doctor, I don’t measure things! What am I, a plumber? It seems like… more lately, maybe? A little bit more. Enough that I have to… well, you know. Change things more often. It's just… a nuisance, really. And frankly, it smells. A little. Not terrible, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: "Noticeable odor." Very well. Now, Mrs. Genard, have you experienced any pain, burning, or discomfort with this leakage?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. It’s… stinging, sometimes. Like a little… tickle. And when I wipe, it feels a bit raw. Not a sharp pain, just… irritated. And sometimes, when it’s been happening a while, it feels… warm. Just a little. But mostly just irritating.
DOCTOR: Irritation and a warming sensation. We're getting somewhere. Now, have there been any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary… habits? Oh, goodness. You’re asking a lot, Doctor. What does that even mean? I mean, I go to the bathroom like everyone else. Maybe… maybe I go a little more often now? It’s hard to say. I drink a lot of water, you know? Stay hydrated. But I don’t think I’m… having trouble, exactly. It just… feels like I need to go more frequently.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination, you say. Very well. Now, Mrs. Genard, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Doctor, really! What kind of question is that? I'm a 73-year-old woman! I haven't been… involved with anyone in a long time. A very long time. It’s… not something I discuss. And frankly, it's irrelevant. It's just this… leaking! Why do you need to know all this personal stuff?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, these questions are… standard procedure. We must rule out all possibilities. It’s simply… thoroughness. However, if you are truly unwilling to provide this information, we can proceed… with limitations. Now, do you experience any vaginal odor outside of this leakage you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, don't get me started on smells! As I said, the leaking smells a bit… unpleasant. And yes, sometimes… even when there's no leaking, there's a bit of a smell. Not always, but sometimes. It's not a fresh smell, if you know what I mean. It's… old. Like it’s been there a while. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I try to keep everything very clean, but…
DOCTOR: "Subject reports 'old' odor." Very well. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge other than this leakage?
PATIENT: Discharge… other than the leaking? Oh, goodness, Doctor, you're really making me uncomfortable now. Let me think… it used to be… clear, maybe? Or white? I don’t really pay attention to those things. Now it’s… yellowish sometimes. And… thicker. Not like cream, but… not watery, you know? It's just… different. And it's been happening since this leaking started.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge, thicker consistency… Very well. Now, Mrs. Genard, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. It’s necessary to determine the cause of these symptoms. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh. A physical examination? Doctor, honestly… I didn't expect this. Look, I really don't like being poked and prodded. I'm an old woman, you know? And… private. Is there really no other way? Can’t you just… give me something for it? Some kind of cream?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but a proper diagnosis requires a physical exam. I cannot prescribe medication without knowing the cause of your symptoms. It’s… irresponsible. Now, I assure you, I will be as efficient and discreet as possible. It will be a quick examination, and I will explain everything as I proceed. Do you consent to the examination?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I… I suppose so. But… be gentle, please. And explain everything. I really don't like surprises. And… try to be quick, like you said. I really don't want to be up there for too long. It’s… awkward, you know? And don't say anything embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would please lie down on the table, and we will begin. First, I will need to visually inspect the area. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. This is… not very dignified, you know. Please, be quick. And… don't look surprised if anything looks… old. I haven’t been checked in a long, long time.
DOCTOR: I observe some mild erythema of the labia majora and minora. No visible lesions. There is a small amount of yellowish discharge present. Now, this may feel slightly uncomfortable… Just try to relax, Mrs. Genard. I note a thin, yellowish vaginal discharge with a slightly fishy odor. The cervix appears normal, but there is some postmenopausal atrophy of the vaginal walls. Uterus is normal size and shape. No adnexal masses or tenderness. Alright, that concludes the examination.
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t as bad as I thought. Still… unpleasant. What does all that mean? Erythema? Atrophy? What’s wrong with me, Doctor? Is it something serious? And what are you going to do about it? I really just want this to go away. And I don't want any surprises, remember?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, your examination suggests a diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis, likely secondary to postmenopausal hormonal changes. The erythema refers to redness and inflammation of the vaginal tissues, and the atrophy indicates thinning and weakening of the vaginal walls. The discharge is likely a result of the inflammation and altered vaginal flora. It is not… serious in the sense of being life-threatening, but it can cause significant discomfort and affect your quality of life. We can treat this with topical estrogen therapy. A small amount of estrogen cream applied vaginally can help restore the vaginal tissues and alleviate your symptoms. I will prescribe a two-week course of conjugated estrogen cream. Apply a small amount nightly as directed. We can re-evaluate in six weeks to assess your response. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Estrogen cream? Oh… goodness. Isn't estrogen… dangerous? I've heard terrible things about hormones. I don't want to get cancer or anything! And… applying it myself? I’m not very good with… things like that. And six weeks? That’s a long time. What if it doesn't work? And what if I have a bad reaction? I really don’t like this, Doctor. Is there anything else I can do? Some kind of… natural remedy? Or maybe just a stronger cream?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, the risks associated with topical estrogen therapy are minimal, especially compared to systemic hormone replacement. The estrogen is applied directly to the vaginal tissues, so very little is absorbed into the bloodstream. The benefits – alleviating your discomfort and improving your quality of life – outweigh the risks in your case. As for "natural remedies," I do not recommend them. Their efficacy is not scientifically proven, and they may interact with other medications. We can try a higher-strength estrogen cream if the initial dose is ineffective, but I assure you, a two-week course is often sufficient. I will provide you with clear instructions on how to apply the cream. It is a simple procedure, and I am confident you will be able to manage it. Do you have any specific concerns about the application process?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I just… I’m afraid I’ll do it wrong. And I'm afraid it'll smell even worse! I don't want to make things worse, you know? And what if it leaks out? I don't want to get it on my clothes. And I really, really don't want to get it on my furniture! This is all very complicated, Doctor. Maybe I should just… live with it. It's just a little uncomfortable, after all.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, with all due respect, your anxieties are… disproportionate. The amount of estrogen cream applied is minimal, and the risk of leakage or odor is extremely low. I am providing you with clear instructions and a small amount of medication to alleviate your discomfort. I cannot address irrational fears. I will provide a written handout with detailed instructions on how to apply the cream and address any potential concerns. If you continue to experience significant anxiety, I suggest you consult with a therapist. Do you have any remaining questions regarding the medication itself?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No… I don't think so. I just… I wish things were simpler. And I wish you wouldn't look at me like that. It's embarrassing enough as it is, you know? Alright… fine. I'll try the cream. But if anything goes wrong… I'm calling you. And don't expect me to come back. .
DOCTOR: Very well. If you have any concerns, the nursing staff can address them. .
