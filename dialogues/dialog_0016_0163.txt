DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, it's rather a long story, but I’ve been…experimenting, shall we say, with some rather…vigorous dietary regimes lately. I thought it best to have a professional opinion, before I do anything…irreversible.
DOCTOR: “Vigorous dietary regimes,” okay. That sounds…interesting. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. You see, I’ve always been rather…interested in pushing boundaries. In my line of work—special effects, you know—it’s all about illusion, transformation. And I suppose that’s bled over into other areas of my life. Recently, I attempted a diet consisting solely of…well, primarily of liquids. Fruit juices, vegetable blends, that sort of thing. For a rather extended period. Before that, there was the cabbage soup affair. And before that…a somewhat alarming phase involving only foods of a single colour. It’s…complicated.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a series of quite restrictive diets, experimenting with different approaches. And how long have you been doing this, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see…the liquid diet was approximately six weeks, I believe. The cabbage soup, perhaps a fortnight. And the coloured foods…that was rather sporadic, on and off for a few months. It's been…building, I suppose, over the last year. Though I must say, the initial impetus was…well, a rather unflattering photograph taken at a friend’s birthday party. A rather rude shock to the system, you understand.
DOCTOR: A photograph can be quite motivating! And how have you been feeling during these diets?
PATIENT: Ah, that’s where things become…less ideal. Initially, quite a burst of energy, I must admit, the sort of feeling one gets from drastic change. However, that subsided rather rapidly. Weakness, naturally. A perpetual feeling of…chilliness. And, if I’m quite honest, a rather alarming susceptibility to irritability. My housekeeper, Mrs. Higgins, bore the brunt of that, I’m afraid. And the…digestive consequences were…unpleasant, to say the least. It became increasingly difficult to concentrate on my work, which, as you can imagine, is…problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, chills, irritability, and digestive issues – and difficulty concentrating. That sounds…not comfortable at all. And how about your weight?
PATIENT: Well, that’s…a bit of a fraught topic. Initially, rapid weight loss, which, naturally, was encouraging. However, it didn’t…remain stable. It’s a rather peculiar pattern, actually. I’d lose a considerable amount, then, upon resuming a more normal diet, it would…return with something of a vengeance. It’s rather like an elastic band, snapping back. And, if I’m quite frank, I’m now, perhaps, a touch heavier than I was before I embarked on any of this. A rather disheartening turn of events, I must say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so initial weight loss, then rebound weight gain. That sounds very typical of restrictive diets. Before we get into a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I suppose I’ve been rather…fatigued. Beyond the initial weakness, a sort of pervasive weariness. And, I’ve noticed my…hair. It seems to be…thinner. Not dramatically, you understand, but noticeable to a discerning eye. And, if I’m quite honest, my skin has lost some of its…elasticity. It's rather like a well-loved puppet, starting to show its age. Oh, and I've been feeling…rather cold, even when others are comfortable. A persistent chill, you see. Does that…illuminate the situation?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, hair thinning, skin changes, and persistent feeling of cold…those all sound concerning, particularly with the history of restrictive diets. I’m going to do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Quite alright, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I rather suspect a thorough examination is in order. Though, if you happen to discover any lingering traces of green paint, please do disregard them. It's a hazard of the trade, you see. Special effects, and all that.
DOCTOR: I'll keep an eye out for green paint. First, let's just listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit quiet, but nothing immediately concerning. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little on the low side, 110/70. Pulse is regular, but a bit slow, 60 beats per minute. Now, I'd like to take a look at your thyroid gland. It's in your neck, and it controls your metabolism. Hmm, the thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and it's a little bit tender. I'm also noticing some dryness of your skin. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a possible thyroid issue, potentially hypothyroidism - an underactive thyroid. However, we need to do some blood tests to confirm that. Would you be willing to get some blood work done?
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism, you say? An underactive thyroid? Hmm. Well, that certainly explains the persistent chill, and, now that you mention it, the…lassitude. And the dryness of the skin. Yes, that rings…alarmingly true. Blood tests, you say? Absolutely, Doctor. Most certainly. Anything to illuminate the situation. I trust your laboratory is…competent? I’ve had unfortunate experiences with inaccurate results in the past, involving a rather complicated costume design. But yes, please, proceed with the blood work. I’m…eager to ascertain the cause of this…malady.
DOCTOR: I assure you our lab is very competent. We'll check your thyroid hormone levels, as well as some other routine blood work to get a complete picture of your health. I’ll also order a complete blood count to check for any other deficiencies. I’m writing up the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn’t take long. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any further restrictive diets. Focus on eating a balanced diet with plenty of protein, fruits, and vegetables. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve been remarkably thorough. A balanced diet…protein, fruits, vegetables. It seems…almost…too sensible. After my recent…experiments, it’s rather daunting. But, yes, I shall endeavour to adhere to your recommendations. However, if I may ask…what precisely causes this…hypothyroidism? Is it a consequence of my dietary…indiscretions? Or is it simply…a regrettable inevitability of advancing years? And, if it is hypothyroidism, what…prognosis can I anticipate? I trust it’s not…fatal? I have several unfinished projects, you see. A rather elaborate automaton, and a particularly challenging sequence involving pyrotechnics.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Vantine. Hypothyroidism can have several causes. Sometimes it’s an autoimmune condition, where your body attacks the thyroid gland. Sometimes it’s due to genetics. And, while extremely restrictive diets can sometimes contribute to thyroid issues, it’s less common. It’s usually not the primary cause. As for the prognosis, it's generally very good. Hypothyroidism is very treatable with thyroid hormone replacement medication. Most people live completely normal, healthy lives with treatment. It's definitely not fatal. We'll get the blood work results back within a few days, and then we can discuss the best course of treatment for you. In the meantime, focusing on a balanced diet is a great start. And I assure you, you'll be able to finish your projects! Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: That is…exceedingly reassuring, Doctor. Remarkably reassuring. Treatment is available, a normal life is attainable…and I can complete my projects! Excellent. No, I believe that covers my concerns for the moment. I shall endeavour to follow your recommendations regarding the diet. And I shall await the results of the blood work with…a degree of optimism. Thank you, Doctor Maskal. You have been most…attentive and helpful. I am greatly indebted to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. And please, do try to enjoy your projects!
