DOCTOR: Right. Ellan Rannells, 74. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? Yes. It’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it'll help with… things. I’m not one for all that newfangled nonsense, but she’s quite insistent. And frankly, at my age, one is willing to consider options. Though I have my reservations, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. Right. Your daughter is encouraging you to try medical marijuana. And you’re… hesitant. I see. And what “things” exactly are you hoping it will help with?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not that I'm hoping. It's more… she thinks it'll calm my nerves. And perhaps… assist with sleep. I don’t suffer from insomnia, you understand, but a good night’s rest is always welcome. It’s just… I’m not one to take things I don't fully understand. And frankly, the whole idea seems rather… uncouth. Is it even legal? I wouldn't want to get myself into trouble.
DOCTOR: Legal status varies. We can discuss that later if necessary. So, you’re primarily concerned with anxiety and… occasional difficulty sleeping. How long have you been experiencing these issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? Well, the nerves… they've been with me for as long as I can remember, truthfully. A woman in my line of work sees things. Difficult things. As for the sleep… it comes and goes. Lately, perhaps a few weeks where I’m not as… restful as I’d like. It’s not every night, mind you. I’m not one to complain unnecessarily. It’s just… one wants to feel one’s best, you see? And my daughter says this… marijuana, might help. Though I still maintain it sounds rather… frivolous.
DOCTOR: Right. Long-standing anxiety, with recent fluctuations in sleep. And your daughter is the one suggesting this. Have you tried anything else to help with either of these issues?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I’m not one to rush into things without due diligence, you understand. I've tried… chamomile tea. Quite soothing, though it doesn't always work. And my husband, bless his soul, makes me a warm milk with honey before bed. That helps… sometimes. I’ve also always been a very… composed person. One doesn’t simply allow oneself to be overcome, you see? But even a composed person has their… moments. It’s just… lately those moments have been… more frequent, perhaps. And my daughter insists this… marijuana… is a more… effective solution. Though I remain skeptical.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea, warm milk. Coping strategies, then. And your daughter is still pushing for the marijuana. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had the measles as a child, of course. And a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but one recovers, doesn’t one? My blood pressure has been a little… elevated on occasion, but nothing a bit of careful watching hasn’t managed. I’ve always been… quite robust, truthfully. I spend a great deal of time on my feet, you see. It's rather demanding work, being a bailiff. Though, as I said, it comes with… certain sights. But I’m not one to dwell on unpleasantness. I've always prided myself on my resilience. Do you need a list? My daughter keeps excellent records. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. Measles, elevated blood pressure… Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I had my gallbladder removed… oh, goodness, must be fifteen years ago now. And I broke my wrist once, falling down the stairs. Rather embarrassing, actually. But it healed perfectly. Aside from that… no. I’ve always been very careful. I eat a sensible diet, and as I said, I’m always on my feet. It keeps one… active, you see? Though I confess, the work can be… stressful. My daughter keeps saying that's why I should try this… marijuana. But frankly, I still think it’s rather… a last resort. And I haven’t even begun to consider the… side effects.
DOCTOR: Right. Gallbladder removal, broken wrist. And your daughter continues to advocate for the marijuana. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, as needed. And occasionally, a bit of ibuprofen for aches and pains. Nothing… substantial. I don't believe in filling myself with all sorts of chemicals unnecessarily, you understand. My husband, he takes a statin, but I've always avoided them. I believe in a natural approach, when possible. Though, I confess, as one gets older… one is sometimes forced to reconsider. But I still remain skeptical about this… marijuana. Is it even… proper? I'm a respectable woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed. Okay. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything. Not to my knowledge, anyway. I’m quite robust, as I said. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I can eat anything, really. And I’ve never had a problem with… pollen, or dust, or animals, or anything like that. I pride myself on my… resilience. Though, I confess, my daughter insists I should be more careful. She worries constantly. But frankly, I think she’s overreacting. This whole marijuana situation… it just seems so… unconventional. And I'm not sure I'm comfortable with it.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Though I must warn you, I’ve been on my feet all day. It's rather demanding work, you see. But I assure you, I’m quite steady. I pride myself on my… balance. One must be, in my line of work. There. Perfectly steady. Though, perhaps a chair nearby would be… prudent. Just in case.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are diminished at the bases. Blood pressure is 148/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Overall, within normal limits for your age, though your blood pressure is a little elevated. Anything else you’ve been experiencing physically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my knees do ache a bit in the evenings. It's the standing, you see. And my hands get a little… stiff sometimes. But nothing unbearable. I just put it down to… age. One doesn't expect to be as nimble as one once was, you understand. And my sleep… as I mentioned, it's not terribly restful on occasion. I wake up feeling… a little… unrefreshed. But I wouldn't call it a problem. Just a minor inconvenience. Though my daughter, she worries terribly. She keeps saying this… marijuana… will solve all my woes. But frankly, I remain unconvinced. It just seems so… frivolous. Is it even… safe? And will it interfere with my work? I absolutely must be able to perform my duties.
DOCTOR: Aching knees, stiff hands, occasional sleep disturbance. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Look, I understand your reluctance. Medical marijuana can be helpful for some patients, but it’s not a miracle cure. And it does have potential side effects and risks. Given your history and concerns… frankly, I don’t think it’s the best option for you at this time. We can discuss other approaches for managing your blood pressure, sleep, and aches and pains. Physical therapy, medication adjustments… We have more conventional options. .
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… disappointing. Though, I suppose I expected as much. It just seems… so unconventional. My daughter will be quite upset, naturally. But if you believe it’s not in my best interests… I suppose I must defer to your professional judgment. Physical therapy… medication adjustments… yes, I suppose those would be… more sensible. Very well. What do you recommend, then? And will it interfere with my work? I absolutely must be able to perform my duties, you understand. Being a bailiff… it’s a rather demanding profession.
