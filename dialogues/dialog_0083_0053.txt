DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's...trouble going to the bathroom, mostly. It’s just…hard to start, you know? And it takes a long time, even then. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty initiating urination and a slow stream for about a month. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Yadao. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. More…a strain. Like I have to push a little. And sometimes, even after I think I’m done, it feels like there’s still some left. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But it's getting…annoying. I don't want to have to sit there forever every time.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Yadao, and you shouldn't be embarrassed at all. This is a common issue, and we’re here to help. So, straining to initiate urination, a sensation of incomplete emptying… Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream – like it’s weaker than usual, or does it spray in different directions?
PATIENT: Hmm…weaker, maybe? It's not like a powerful stream anymore, no. And I don’t think it sprays, not that I’ve noticed. It's just…thin. And it takes a while to get going, like I said. I have to wait a bit before it really starts. I also find myself going more often at night than I used to. Not a lot more, but enough that I wake up once or twice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have weakening of the stream, hesitancy – that’s the difficulty starting – a sensation of incomplete emptying, and increased frequency at night, which we call nocturia. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning or pain at all. Just the strain, and the waiting. It's really the waiting that bothers me the most. And having to go back to the bathroom shortly after I've already been. It's…disruptive, you know? I like to get things done.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Disruptive is a good way to put it. Alright, Ms. Yadao, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was just stress, and it went down with some changes in my life. Otherwise, no, nothing major. No diabetes, no kidney problems. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago and never bothered me since. Oh, and I have arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't really affect anything…much. I'm on Medicare, if that's important.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. High blood pressure in the past, gallbladder removal, and arthritis. Medicare is good to know for billing purposes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medication. It's called…let me see…Celebrex. And sometimes, if my hands are really bad, I take ibuprofen. But that's about it. No supplements, no vitamins, nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for arthritis and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about it, but I've never had a problem. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don’t think I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao, that's very good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – had any problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. My father had some trouble with his prostate when he got older, I remember that. He didn’t talk about it much, but my mother said he had to go to the doctor a lot. And my brother…I think he had some kidney stones once, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, no, not that I recall. My mother was healthy as a horse until the very end.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of prostate issues in your father and kidney stones in your brother. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That would involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological exam. We’ll also need to do a urine test to check for infection and other issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A urine test sounds sensible, and I don’t mind the exam. Just tell me if anything feels…strange. I’m not a fan of surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie back on the exam table. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes briefly. Those are also normal. Now, I'll need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll show you how to collect it. Just try to collect a midstream sample, if you can. That means letting a little bit go out first, then collecting the middle part.
PATIENT: Okay, midstream. Right. I think I remember that from…well, from other doctor visits. I’ll be right back. Hopefully, I can manage the midstream part. It's been a while since I’ve had to do this.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Yadao. There's no rush at all. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Here you go. I think I managed the midstream part okay. It was a little awkward, but I did my best. Hopefully, it’s enough for you to test.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is perfect. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few minutes to get the results back. While we’re waiting, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you drink a lot of fluids throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, I try to. I drink mostly water, and some tea. Maybe six or eight glasses a day? I used to drink more coffee, but the doctor said it wasn’t good for my bladder, so I cut back. I also try to avoid drinking too much before bedtime, so I don’t have to get up in the night.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Yadao. Staying hydrated is very important, and cutting back on coffee is a good idea. Now, do you have any trouble with constipation?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not regularly, but… it happens. I try to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables, but sometimes it’s…difficult. It's not a huge problem, but I wouldn’t say it’s perfect, either. I have to…push a little sometimes, you know? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that can matter, Ms. Yadao. Constipation can put pressure on the bladder and make it harder to empty completely. Okay, the lab results are back. Everything looks normal – no infection, and your kidney function is good. That's good news. Based on your history, physical exam, and the lab results, it sounds like you may have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlarged prostate. It’s very common in men as they get older, but women can experience similar symptoms. The symptoms you’re describing – hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia – are all consistent with that. Now, it's important to understand that BPH is not cancer. It’s simply an enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause the urinary symptoms you're experiencing. Would you like me to explain the treatment options?
PATIENT: Benign…Prostatic Hyperplasia? I'm a woman, Doctor. Is that…possible? I thought that was a men's problem. And I don't understand how I could have that. I'm a little confused. Could you explain that part a little more slowly? I feel like I'm missing something. I understand it’s not cancer, that’s good, but…an enlarged prostate? In me?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Ms. Yadao, and I apologize for the confusing terminology. That was a lapse in my communication. You do not have an enlarged prostate, as you correctly pointed out – that’s a male-specific anatomy. What you’re experiencing is very similar to what men experience with BPH, but it's caused by different factors. In women, it’s often due to a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder, and changes in the bladder itself as we age. The symptoms – hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia – are the same, and we often use the term “lower urinary tract symptoms” to describe it in women. It's sometimes also referred to as overactive bladder or pelvic floor dysfunction. Again, I apologize for the initial confusion with the term BPH. It was a mistake on my part to use that terminology with you. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes much more sense. Weakened pelvic floor muscles, changes in the bladder…that sounds more like me. I’ve never had children, if that matters. And I’ve always been…thin, so I don't have much padding down there, if you know what I mean. I always thought my muscles were pretty strong, but I suppose they can weaken with age. So, what can be done about it? You mentioned treatment options. What are those? I'd like to know what my choices are, and what you would recommend, given my situation.
DOCTOR: Yes, that information about not having children and your body type is helpful. There are several treatment options available, Ms. Yadao, and we can tailor a plan to your specific needs. The first line of treatment usually involves lifestyle modifications. These include pelvic floor exercises – often called Kegel exercises – to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. We can refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor therapy to teach you the proper technique. We also recommend timed voiding, which means going to the bathroom on a regular schedule, even if you don’t feel the urge, to retrain your bladder. It’s also important to maintain adequate hydration, but to avoid drinking large amounts of fluids before bedtime. If lifestyle modifications aren’t enough, we can consider medications. There are several medications available that can help relax the bladder muscles and reduce the urge to urinate. However, these medications can have side effects, so we would discuss those carefully before starting them. In more severe cases, or if medications aren’t effective, we can consider other procedures, such as pelvic floor stimulation or, in rare cases, surgery. However, those options are typically reserved for more complex cases. Given your situation, I would recommend starting with lifestyle modifications, specifically pelvic floor therapy. We can get a referral to a good physical therapist in the area, and you can work with them to develop a personalized exercise program. We can also discuss timed voiding and hydration strategies. We can reassess your symptoms in a few weeks to see how you’re progressing, and adjust the plan as needed. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Pelvic floor therapy sounds like a good place to start. I don't want to jump straight to medication if I can avoid it. And I’m willing to try the timed voiding and hydration strategies. A referral to a physical therapist would be great. Do they have a waiting list, usually? And is it…embarrassing to talk to them about this? I'm a bit worried about that part, to be honest. It's not easy talking about these things. But I want to get this sorted out, so I'm willing to try. Do you have any recommendations for finding a good therapist? Maybe one who has experience with women my age?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about embarrassment, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly normal to feel that way, and the therapists we refer to are very experienced in dealing with these types of issues and are very sensitive and discreet. They’re used to it, and they’re there to help, not to judge. They’ll create a comfortable and safe environment for you. As for waiting lists, it can vary. Let me give you the names and numbers of two excellent physical therapists in the area who specialize in pelvic floor therapy for women. One is Sarah Miller at [Phone Number] and the other is Emily Carter at [Phone Number]. I would recommend calling both and asking about their availability and experience with women your age. They both have good reputations, and I’m confident you’ll find someone you’re comfortable with. I'll also give you a handout with information about pelvic floor exercises and timed voiding strategies. It includes some diagrams and instructions to get you started. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've answered all my questions, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on and what my options are. I’ll call those therapists and see who has an opening. And I'll try the exercises and timed voiding. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here for you. I'll have the nurse print out that handout for you now. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
