DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I haven't got all day. It's these… well, my stools. They’re black. Been happening a bit lately. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. The doctor keeps saying they're fine, but still. Black stools aren’t normal, are they?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concern, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Black, tarry stools are indeed something we need to investigate. It’s good you’ve noticed this change. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It’s been… well, a few weeks now, I suppose. Maybe a month? It comes and goes. Not every time, thankfully. It’s just… worrying, you know? I don’t usually bother with doctors unless it’s something serious. And frankly, I’m not one for making a fuss. But black is just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Hatchard, and I assure you, it’s wise to get this checked out. A month of intermittent black stools is certainly worth investigating. To clarify, is the stool consistently black when it occurs, or does the color vary?
PATIENT: Consistently black. Like… oil, almost. Not just a little dark, black. And it smells… different. Hard to explain. Not the usual… you know. It’s not watery, either. More… formed. If that makes any sense. Honestly, I don’t see what good talking about stool consistency is going to do, but you're the doctor.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Hatchard, and you are right to question what information is relevant. The consistency and smell are important clues. You mentioned you take pain pills for arthritis. Could you tell me the name and dosage of those, please?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It's naproxen. Five-hundred milligrams. Usually two a day, sometimes three if my joints are really acting up. Been taking them for… well, years now, honestly. Since before I retired. The old doctor – Dr. Hemlock, lovely man – he said they were fine, long as I didn’t go over three. But he retired, you know. Now it’s this… younger one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That's helpful information. Long-term naproxen use can sometimes contribute to gastrointestinal issues. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is enough, if you ask me. Old age, mostly. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but I recovered just fine. Nothing else. Perfectly healthy, aside from the joints, naturally. I don’t go around complaining, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Hatchard. It’s good to know you've had a relatively healthy history otherwise. Now, could you tell me about any family history of gastrointestinal problems, such as ulcers, colon cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family? Let me think... My mother had indigestion, always complaining about it. But that was just… old age again, I suppose. My brother… he had something with his stomach once, but it was a long time ago and I don’t really remember the details. Honestly, my family wasn’t one for talking about… well, those things. It was all very hush-hush.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. Family medical history can sometimes be difficult to recall. To complete the picture, could you briefly describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh, don't get me started. I eat what I like, mostly. I like my meats, my potatoes... not one for all that salad nonsense. And I enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. I try to avoid sweets, but I’m not one for strict rules, you know? I don’t eat a lot of fruit, though. Too much fuss peeling it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief check of your vitals. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? Honestly, I don’t see what good it’ll do. But alright, fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it, will you? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range for your age. I am detecting some tenderness when I press on your lower abdomen. Is this where you typically feel discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. Right there. Not terrible pain, but… uncomfortable. Sort of a dull ache. It comes and goes, mostly after I've eaten. And sometimes it feels… bloated, you know? Like I’ve eaten too much. Which I haven’t, necessarily. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That's helpful. Given your symptoms of black stools, tenderness in your lower abdomen, and your long-term naproxen use, it’s important we investigate the potential cause. The most concerning possibility would be bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially from an ulcer or other source. I would like to order some laboratory tests to evaluate this further. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a fecal occult blood test to detect the presence of blood in your stool. Additionally, I recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize the lining of your stomach and duodenum. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests, tests, tests. More poking and prodding, and now looking inside me? Honestly, this is all a bit much. Anemia? Ulcers? It sounds dreadful! I don't like the sound of any of this. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But no guarantees, you hear? And the quicker the better. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Hatchard. These tests are designed to provide us with a clearer picture of what’s happening, and to rule out any serious concerns. I assure you, we will proceed as efficiently as possible. The CBC and FOBT can be done here at the clinic. We’ll schedule the upper endoscopy with a gastroenterologist – Dr. Ramirez is excellent, I’ll give you his information. It will require a fasting period beforehand. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily discontinuing the naproxen if possible, and we can discuss alternative pain management options. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Stop the naproxen? Oh, goodness. What am I supposed to do for the pain then? My arthritis will be awful! I can barely get around as it is. I don't like the idea of stopping it, not at all. But alright. If you insist. But you have to give me something else, you hear? Something to take instead. And quickly, please!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concern about managing your pain. We will definitely find an alternative. For the time being, I can prescribe a short course of acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, for pain relief. It’s less likely to cause gastrointestinal issues than naproxen. We can also discuss physical therapy options to help manage your arthritis pain long-term. I will write a prescription for the acetaminophen now, and schedule you for the CBC and FOBT. We’ll also arrange the upper endoscopy as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Just… old age. And a general dislike for doctors and poking and prodding. Honestly, this has been a dreadful morning. Are we finished now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. I've written the prescription for the acetaminophen. I’ll have the nurse schedule the laboratory tests and the endoscopy consultation. She’ll also provide you with instructions for fasting before the endoscopy. To summarize, we are discontinuing the naproxen temporarily and switching to acetaminophen for pain relief. We are also investigating the cause of your black stools with a CBC, FOBT, and an upper endoscopy. I will document everything in your chart, and we'll review the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get it over with. And quickly. Honestly, I have better things to do than sit around waiting for tests. Thank you... I suppose.
