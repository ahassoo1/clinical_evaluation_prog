DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up. Started a few days ago, and it just keeps getting bigger. It’s mostly on this side, <points to left foot> but it’s kinda achy all over now, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So, the swelling started a few days ago in your left foot and now it’s becoming achy all over. Can you tell me a little more about that ache?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, you know? More like… a dull throb. It’s there when I walk, definitely. And even when I’m just sitting, if I move my foot a certain way. It's hard to explain. It doesn’t feel broken, if that makes sense. I haven’t fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull throb that's worse with walking and certain movements, and no injury… That’s helpful. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the foot along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. <Looks down at foot, flexing ankle> It feels warm, maybe? Hard to tell, really. And yeah, there’s a little redness, now that you mention it. It’s not bright red, more… a kinda pinkish color, around the ankle bone mostly. I hadn't really paid attention to the color, just the size.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to help with the swelling or pain so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve been trying to keep my foot up when I can. And I put some ice on it a couple of times. Didn’t seem to do much, honestly. It feels a little better right after the ice, but it comes back pretty quick. I also took some of those over-the-counter pain pills, the ibuprofen, but they didn’t really touch the ache either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so elevation, ice, and ibuprofen haven’t provided much relief. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. Never had any trouble with sugar or anything, and my legs… they get tired, but no more than you’d expect, I guess. I work on my feet all day, so… is that something I should be worried about? Like, the circulation?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a loan interviewer, mostly. It's at a small office, helping people fill out paperwork and stuff. Lots of sitting, but also getting up and walking around to get files, talking to people… it’s not super physical, but I'm on my feet a good part of the day. It’s kinda stressful, too, dealing with people and money, you know? Doesn't really feel like it would cause a swollen foot, but… who knows?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can usually take most things, as long as it’s not something really strong. I don't take a lot of medicine normally. Just the ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your foot. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. <Starts to carefully get onto the examination table, wincing slightly> Be careful, it’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling around here. I notice some swelling, as you mentioned, and a little bit of redness and warmth. There’s also some tenderness when I move your foot this way and that way. I’m checking your pulse here… good, I feel a strong pulse. Is this painful when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit. <Grimaces> Not terrible, but I can feel it. It’s kinda a dull ache, like you said before. It’s worse when you bend it down like that. <Points towards plantarflexion> Feels… stretched, almost. Is that normal? Is something pulled? I'm getting worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay. It doesn’t feel like a typical muscle pull, but we need to rule things out. I'm going to check your other foot just to compare. Alright, your right foot feels normal. That’s good. Given your symptoms and what I’m feeling during the exam, it could be a few things. It could be a sprain, although you didn't have an injury, which makes that less likely. It could also be something called cellulitis, which is an infection of the skin. Or, less likely, it could be something related to your circulation, though your pulse feels strong. To be safe, I’d like to order a couple of tests. We'll need to check your blood count to see if there's any sign of infection, and I think an X-ray would be good to rule out a fracture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests sound… sensible, I guess. I'd rather know what's going on than just sit here worrying. Blood count and X-ray, right? Will that take long? And… will it be expensive? I don’t really have insurance, so… I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, a blood count and an X-ray. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the X-ray shouldn’t take much longer. As for the cost… I understand your concern about not having insurance. Our clinic does have a sliding scale fee based on income, and we can discuss that with the billing department. Let me write the orders and then we can go over the options with the front desk. I also want to be clear – if it is cellulitis, we'll need to treat it with antibiotics. I'll also recommend keeping your foot elevated and off of it as much as possible until we get the results back. <Starts typing on computer>
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. A sliding scale would be good, really good. And antibiotics… I guess if that’s what I need, that’s what I need. Elevating it, I can do that. It’s just… hard when I’m working. But I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, making me feel less scared, at least. I really appreciate it. <Looks down at swollen foot with a worried expression> I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet. Let's get these orders sent in, and then the front desk can set up the blood draw and X-ray. In the meantime, try to limit walking as much as possible, and if you notice any fever, chills, or increased pain, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. <Hands orders to patient> Here are the orders. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. I really appreciate your help. I'll go talk to the front desk now. <Carefully gets off the examination table, wincing slightly>
