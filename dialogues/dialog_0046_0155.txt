DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, you know? Just wanted to get it checked, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. A shaking, you said, primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, hands. Sometimes it feels like… like trying to hold water. Slippery, you know? And it’s worse when I try to… do things. Like, holding a cup, or… buttoning my coat. Things like that. Not always, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it impacts your ability to perform fine motor tasks, like holding a cup or buttoning a coat, and it’s intermittent – it comes and goes. Could you tell me a little bit more about when you first noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tough one. Honestly, Doctor, it's hard to say. A few months, maybe? Or was it longer? I… I used to work at the water plant, you see, and I was always pretty steady with my hands, doing calibrations and such. But now… I retired a couple years back, so it could've been starting then, maybe? Everything kind of blends together, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Jezik. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact onset of symptoms. A few months, or potentially longer, since you noticed it impacting tasks like calibrations. Has the shaking been gradually worsening since you first noticed it, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Not gotten much worse, exactly. Just… always there, bubbling under the surface. Some days it's quieter, some days it's louder. But it hasn't, like, doubled or anything. Just… annoying. And a little worrisome, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Annoying and a little worrisome" – that’s a very fair way to put it, Mr. Jezik. Aside from your hands, have you noticed any shaking in other parts of your body – your legs, your head, your voice, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little in my leg. Not a bad shake, like my hands. Just… a bit of a tremble sometimes when I’m sitting still. Mostly my hands though. My voice… no, I don’t think so. Though my daughter always tells me I mumble. But that’s just old age, I think!
DOCTOR: It could be! A little tremble in your leg, primarily when sitting still. And no changes in your voice. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get tired easier these days. But everyone gets tired, right? And my balance isn’t what it used to be. I almost tripped over the rug last week, but… I mostly just blame that on old age too, ha. Nothing serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased fatigue and a bit of unsteadiness on your feet. Have you experienced any stiffness in your joints, any changes in your coordination, or any difficulty with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Stiffness… sometimes my fingers feel a little achy in the mornings, but nothing like arthritis or anything. Coordination… I don’t know. Hard to say. I haven't been doing much lately. As for my memory... well, you've probably noticed already, it's not the best! It's frustrating, I tell you. Trying to recall names is a nightmare. But, that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that memory can become more challenging with age, Mr. Jezik. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doc told me years ago. I was on pills for it for a while, but… I stopped taking them. Didn't feel like I needed them anymore. I also had something with my prostate a long time ago, but that was treated, and it hasn’t bothered me since. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I haven't seen a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication that you discontinued, and a history of prostate issues that have since resolved. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And… a hernia operation a few years back. That's about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a hernia repair. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was pretty young, so I don't remember much. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always working. As far as I know, no one else had anything… well, no one talked much about health back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I used to love those Czech dumplings my mother made… but that's beside the point.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Jezik. And I appreciate you sharing that memory. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. And I don't really believe in all those vitamins and supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. I just drink my coffee and try to stay warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm retired now, so mostly I just sit around. Used to be active, working at the plant, but now… not so much. I live alone. Don’t really have many hobbies. Read the newspaper sometimes. And drink my coffee! What do you want to know? I just want to get this shaking figured out, if we can.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It's helpful to have that picture. Just trying to understand everything. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife smoked, bless her heart. But I always hated the smell.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. Used to have more, back when I was younger, but not so much anymore. Mostly just to help me sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use – a glass of beer with dinner. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Jezik. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with, then. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your neurological function. I’ll also look at your hands more closely, check your reflexes, and assess your gait. This will help me narrow down the possible causes of your shaking. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Arms out. Like this? It's a bit wobbly, you see? Always has been a bit shaky, even when I was younger. Not this bad, but… always a bit of a tremble.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. It’s present both when you are relaxed and when you try to move your hands. Now, could you please tap your fingers together rapidly, like this?
PATIENT: There... like that. See? Not very smooth, is it? It's like trying to control something that isn't quite under my control. Been getting worse lately, I think. Well, I feel like it has, anyway. It's hard to say, you know? This getting old is a frustrating business.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The movement appears slow and somewhat irregular. Now, could you please place your hands on your lap and I’ll check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Alright, hands on my lap. Just like this? What are you looking for, anyway? Never had anyone check my reflexes before.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but they're equal on both sides. Now, if you're able, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Watch out now, I might fall! See? Not very graceful, is it? My balance isn’t what it used to be. It’s like walking on a boat sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slightly shuffling gait and a somewhat wide base of support. That can contribute to feelings of instability. Okay, if you don’t mind, I'd like to check your range of motion. Now, can you raise your arms over your head?
PATIENT: There. Not as easy as it used to be, you know? A little achy in the shoulders. Getting old… it's all falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Jezik. That completes the physical exam for now. Based on your history and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It's important to run some tests to help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a metabolic panel. I also recommend a neurological consultation to evaluate the tremor more thoroughly. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Well, alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, if that makes sense. Just… get it figured out. The sooner the better, you know? So, yes. Blood work, a neurologist… whatever you think is best. Just… don't keep me waiting too long, if you could.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. I'll get the orders for the blood work sent to the lab right away. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the neurological consultation, I will have my nurse send a referral to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. They will also contact you to schedule an appointment. The results of the blood work will take a few days, and the neurology appointment may take a week or two to schedule. My nurse will keep you informed of the progress. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it done, you know? Get it figured out. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. And thank you for not laughing at me. It’s… embarrassing, admitting all this.
DOCTOR: You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, Mr. Jezik. It takes courage to come in and address these concerns, and I commend you for doing so. It’s my job to help you, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Here's some information regarding the tests and the referral. My nurse, Sarah, will be your point of contact if you have any questions or concerns. Again, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… get it done. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Take care, and please be careful. If you experience any sudden changes, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
