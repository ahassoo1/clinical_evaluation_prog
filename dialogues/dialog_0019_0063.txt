DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It’s been really bad. Hurts a lot. I think... I think it's worse than before. It's the same back, the one I told the other doctors about when they said… when they said I have the cancer. It just… keeps hurting more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I understand. Your back pain, and it's concerning because it seems to be worsening, especially given your history of… well, we’ll get all that documented properly. When you say “the same back”, are we talking about the middle of your back, lower back… or somewhere else specifically?
PATIENT: Lower back, Doctor. Right at the bottom. Sometimes it feels like it goes down my legs a little bit, but mostly just in my lower back. It’s… hard to stand for long, and sleeping is… not easy. I try to move, you know? But even just little things… like bending over… oof. It's bad.
DOCTOR: Right, lower back… and it radiates down your legs sometimes. That's good to know. And it's impacting your ability to stand, sleep, and with everyday movements like bending over. Now, when did you first notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about six months ago? It wasn’t this bad then. Just a little ache. I thought it was from lifting things at work. I work at the factory, you know? Packing boxes. It got slowly worse, little by little. But the really bad pain… that started maybe a month ago. It just… jumped.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago with a gradual ache, worsened over time, and then a significant jump in pain about a month ago. That’s helpful. Now, when you say it "jumped," was there anything specific happening at that time?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I can think of. Just… woke up one morning and it was so much worse. I didn’t do anything different, didn't lift anything heavy… just… pain. I took some of the pills the other doctor gave me, but they didn't help much this time. They used to work a little better.
DOCTOR: I see. So the pain medication isn't as effective as it once was, which is definitely something we need to address. And no specific event triggered this recent worsening. Let’s talk a little bit about that pain. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It's… maybe a seven? Sometimes it goes up to an eight when I try to stand up. It's a pretty steady seven, though. And like I said, bending over… oof. That makes it worse, shoots it up to an eight for a little bit. It’s just… constant. Even when I'm sitting, it's still there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a steady seven, spiking to an eight with movement, particularly bending. And constant even at rest. Now, Ms. Meigs, you mentioned seeing other doctors and a previous diagnosis. Do you recall what the diagnosis was, and do you know what tests were done?
PATIENT: Yes… they said it was… cancer. In my bones. They did… scans. Big machine, you lie down in it. And they took blood a lot. Lots of blood. I don’t remember exactly what kind of cancer, just… bone cancer. They said it was… in my lower back mostly, that's why my back hurts. They gave me some pills and told me to come back, but then… well, I moved, and I had to find a new doctor. It’s all a little blurry, to be honest. I’m sorry. It was a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Meigs. It is a lot to process, and it's understandable that things are blurry. We’ll go through everything carefully. You mentioned bone cancer diagnosed with scans and bloodwork. Now, to get a clearer picture, and with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your range of motion, reflexes, and see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. I want to know what’s going on, so… yes, please. I hope you can help me. It hurts, but… I need to know. Just… be gentle, please? It really hurts when they push on it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. Okay, I'm just feeling along your spine here… and I notice some tenderness right around the L4-L5 vertebrae. And there's some muscle spasm on that side as well. Your reflexes are… a little diminished on the right side, but not dramatically so. And can you tell me if this feels particularly painful?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! Right there, right where you’re pushing. That hurts a lot. And… yeah, that side feels… weak. Like I can't push as hard with that leg as the other one. It’s hard to explain… just… feels different. And the muscle… it feels tight. Really tight. It's always tight, but it's worse when you touch it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, I understand. Tenderness at L4-L5, muscle spasm, diminished reflexes on the right, and weakness. This is consistent with nerve compression, although we need more information to determine the exact cause. Given your history of a previous cancer diagnosis in the bones, it’s crucial we rule out recurrence or progression. I'm going to order some imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on with your vertebrae, the surrounding nerves, and any potential involvement of the bone itself. We’ll also repeat some of the bloodwork to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. MRI and more bloodwork… yes. I just want to know what’s happening, and I want to feel better. When can I get the MRI done? And… will it hurt? I don’t like being in those machines. They make me feel… trapped.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I completely understand your concerns about the MRI. The machine can be a bit claustrophobic, but we can talk about options to make you more comfortable. You can request anti-anxiety medication, and the technicians can often offer headphones and a mirror to help ease your anxiety. I'll have my assistant schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible – likely within the next few days. They'll let you know the exact time and location. It doesn’t typically hurt, but you will need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm and a mild pain reliever. We can also discuss some gentle exercises to help strengthen your core, but we’ll wait until we have the MRI results before starting anything more strenuous. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… okay. And talk about exercises later. Headphones would be good for the machine, please. Tell them I get… scared easily in there. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me. It's been… hard. And I’m worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. And you absolutely should be worried, and it’s okay to feel that way. We'll face this together, step by step. I've made a note of your anxiety regarding the MRI, and the technician will be aware of it. My assistant, Sarah, will come in shortly to schedule the MRI and go over the prescriptions with you. She’ll also give you a handout on gentle back exercises you can look at. Do you have any questions for me before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you again. I feel a little bit better just knowing we’re doing something. Maybe… maybe it’s not as bad as I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Meigs. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and find a solution. I’ll let Sarah know you're ready. .
