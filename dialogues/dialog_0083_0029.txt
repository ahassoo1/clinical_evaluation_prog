DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it’s this… feeling full real quick, you know? I don’t eat much as it is, but now… a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a whole feast. It’s been happening for a little while now, and my wife, Elsie, she got worried. She said I oughta get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I see. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food. And Elsie encouraged you to come in, which is good of her. How long has this been going on, Norval?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't sudden, just sort of crept up on me. At first, I just thought I wasn't as hungry as usual. But then it got to where even a little bit of salmon, which I love, fills me right up. Elsie makes a beautiful salmon chowder, you see... but I can barely have a bowl now. It’s just not right.
DOCTOR: That does sound frustrating, especially with Elsie's chowder! It's good you're paying attention to this change. And it's helpful to know it was gradual. Besides feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other changes in your eating habits?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I haven’t been wanting to eat as much. Not really hungry, like I said. And sometimes… sometimes my stomach feels a little… unsettled. Not pain, exactly, just… queasy. It doesn't happen after every meal, but it’s been happening more often lately. I used to have an iron stomach, you know? Could eat anything. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some nausea or queasiness. And would you say this queasiness is more frequent after you eat, or does it happen at other times as well?
PATIENT: Mostly after eating, yeah. Though sometimes, in the mornings, I wake up feeling a bit… off. Not sick, but not quite right either. It usually goes away after I get up and moving, though. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… a feeling. Like something’s not quite settled in my belly. I haven't thrown up or anything like that, mind you. Elsie gets worried about that, but no, no vomiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse after eating, but can happen in the mornings as well. No vomiting, that’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now. That’s… that’s a bit of a delicate subject, isn’t it? Elsie's been saying I haven't been going as regular as I used to. Not… not a lot, if you know what I mean. And… and sometimes it’s a little harder to… well, you know. Nothing awful, but definitely not like it used to be. I used to be like clockwork, you see? Now… it’s just not the same. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Norval. It’s important information. So, less frequent bowel movements, and some difficulty… …with passage. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Elsie’s been weighing me, she’s very good at keeping track of things. And she says… she says I’ve lost a few pounds. Not a lot, maybe five or six. But she says it’s enough to notice. I haven’t been feeling any weaker or anything, but I suppose she's right. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that's for sure! I like my food, even if I can't eat much of it these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, about five or six pounds of unintentional weight loss. And you haven't noticed any change in your energy levels. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that your primary care doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago now. Other than that… not much, really. The doctor always said I had a strong heart. High blood pressure, a few years back, but they got it under control with pills. I stopped taking them a while ago, doctor said it was okay. Elsie worries about that, but the doctor said I was fine. Otherwise… no, nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and previously managed hypertension that is currently off medication. And have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… I broke my wrist when I was a young man, working on a boat. Had to have surgery to set it. That was a long time ago, though. And… Elsie reminds me, I had a mole removed from my back a few years back. Just a little one, the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Other than that… no, I think that’s it. Nothing major, thankfully. I’ve never been one for hospitals, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, wrist surgery long ago, and a mole removal a few years back. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, Elsie makes me take a fish oil pill every day. She says it’s good for my heart. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. Just when it’s really bad, mind you. Other than that… no, not really. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I like to keep things natural, you see? Elsie keeps a close eye on everything, though. She reminds me if I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish oil daily and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Elsie's always asking me that, too. She’s very thorough, that woman. Never had a problem with any food or pills. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, you see? Growing up in Haida Gwaii, we ate a lot of salmon, berries, everything from the ocean and the land. Never had any trouble. So, no, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... Elsie always asks me about that too. My mother, she lived to be 85. She died of… well, it was old age, mostly. She had a bit of a weak heart towards the end. My father, he was a fisherman, strong as an ox. He died in a boating accident when I was young. As for brothers and sisters... I had two sisters. One died of cancer when she was in her sixties. The other is still alive, but she’s up in Prince Rupert. She’s a bit older than me. As for other illnesses… not that I know of. Mostly just old age, heart problems, a bit of cancer. Nothing too unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Norval. That’s very helpful. So, maternal history of heart problems, paternal history of accidental death, and a sister with a history of cancer. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Elsie always says I should listen to the experts. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. I'm just going to listen to your belly. It may be a little cool. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, especially on the right side. It's not severe, but it's worth noting. I also don't feel any masses or organ enlargement. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and your pulse. Your reflexes are normal, and your pulse is a little slow, but stable. Everything seems to be within normal limits, but the tenderness in your upper abdomen and the changes you've described – feeling full quickly, decreased appetite, weight loss – are concerning. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If blood work will help figure things out, then yes, please. Elsie always says it’s best to get to the bottom of things. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if there's anything special I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No special preparation is needed. You can eat and drink as normal. The lab will take a routine blood sample. We’ll check your liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It will also help us rule out any infection or inflammation. I’ll also order a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding, just to be safe. It may take a few days for the results to come back. Once I have them, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Elsie will be glad to hear we're getting blood work done. She worries so much. Just let me know when and where to go for the tests. And thank you for listening to me. It’s good to know someone is taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. I understand Elsie’s concern, and I’m happy to address your concerns as well. My nurse will give you the lab requisition form and instructions before you leave. The lab is located at the Suburban Medical Center, just down the street. You can go anytime during their regular business hours. We'll schedule a follow up in a week to review the results. If anything changes before then, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor Alanes. Thank you again for your time.
