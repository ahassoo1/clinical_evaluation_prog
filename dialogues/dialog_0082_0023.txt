DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it’s my chest. It… hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It’s… here. <points to chest> Feels like a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the chest. I see. And when did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a week? A little over a week, I think. Hard to say exactly. It wasn’t bad at first, just… something there. Now it’s… more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right, more noticeable recently. Does anything specific seem to trigger it – like activity, eating, or maybe certain positions?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I do roofing, so I’m moving around a lot all day. It doesn’t feel worse when I’m working, actually. And eating… no. Sleeping, sometimes. If I lie on my side. <shrugs> It's strange.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Roofing is… quite physical, you’re right. And it doesn't worsen with exertion. That’s good to know. When you say sleeping, on which side specifically?
PATIENT: My left side, mostly. When I roll over onto my left side, that’s when it hurts more. It’s not bad bad, just… uncomfortable. Like a pressure. My wife says I sometimes make a little noise when I move in my sleep, but I don't remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pressure on the left side, particularly when lying down. And your wife has noticed some noises when you move. Hmm. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel… normal, otherwise. No fever, no cough, no… anything else. I’m eating okay, sleeping okay, except for the chest thing. I haven’t noticed any… lumps or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No fever, no cough, eating and sleeping normally… Okay. It’s good that you haven’t noticed any lumps. It’s hard to say if it’s serious without a proper look, of course. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps feel around a bit. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s… a little worrying, you know? Not used to things hurting.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. It’s always best to get things checked out. Please, have a seat here, and we'll get started. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, breathe in… and out… good. And again. Your heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear, that's good. Now, I'm just going to gently feel around your chest, your ribs, to see if anything feels tender. Let me know if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Okay. <takes a few deep breaths as instructed> It feels… a little sore here. <points to the middle of his chest, slightly to the left> When you press there. Not terrible, but… yeah. Everything else feels normal, I think. Like you said, just there. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Hmm, tenderness in the middle of the chest, slightly to the left. Okay. It’s not necessarily bad, but it's good we’re identifying it. It could be a musculoskeletal issue - something with the muscles or cartilage in your chest wall. Given your line of work, that's a possibility. However, chest pain always warrants careful consideration. Do you have any history of injuries to your chest or ribs?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I've fallen a few times doing roofing, but nothing major. Just scrapes and bruises, you know? Never broke anything. My wife… she worries a lot, so she probably would have remembered if I had. She's good at remembering things like that. <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: No history of major chest injuries. That's good to know. And a mindful wife is a valuable asset! Alright, Mr. Bulaong, I'm going to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious—like a problem with your lungs or heart. It’s a standard precaution. Would you be able to get that done today?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yeah, I can do that. Where do I go? Is it far? I don't have a car, I take the bus. I can ask my wife to come with me if it's too far. Do I need… a special paper or something? I never had an X-ray before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll send the order to the imaging center down the street, at 14 Oak Avenue. It's about a fifteen-minute bus ride, the number 22 bus stops right across the street from the clinic. They accept walk-ins, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead just to check the wait time. The number is 555-1234. Here’s the referral form, and the address and phone number. No special preparation is needed for a chest X-ray. Just let them know you're here as a referral from Dr. Iuzzolino. They will call us with the results, usually within 24 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like shortness of breath, severe pain, dizziness, or sweating—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, 14 Oak Avenue… number 22 bus… got it. <takes the referral form> My wife can help me with the phone call. And I’ll remember about the emergency room. Shortness of breath… I haven't had that, but I will keep an eye out. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. <smiles slightly> I was getting pretty worried there.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It’s always best to be cautious. And I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. We’ll get those X-ray results back as soon as possible, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You answered all my questions. Just… try not to worry too much, right? It’s probably just a muscle, like you said. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go do the X-ray now.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It very well could be a muscle strain. Let's not jump to conclusions. Take care, Mr. Bulaong, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything changes. We'll be in touch. Have a good day.
