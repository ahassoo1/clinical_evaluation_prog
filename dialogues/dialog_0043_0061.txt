DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my… my boy, he says I gotta have a check-up. For… for the team? Something about a tryout. Old man needs a look-see, he says. I forget the name of the team though, sorry. It's been a long time since I thought about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s perfectly alright to forget things, Mr. Murph. It sounds like this check-up is for a sports team tryout – that’s wonderful! Just to be sure I have everything correct, and to get a good understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit more about yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, Doctor. What do you need to know? I'm Mannie… Mannie Murph. I'm… well, I'm seventy now, I think. Maybe sixty-nine? Time gets away from ya. I'm Spanish, originally. Lived here a long time though. I used to… used to take people around, show ‘em the sights. Tour guide, that was it. Now I mostly just… mostly just relax with my wife. We both got insurance, good insurance I think. Never had much trouble with that. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Murph. Thank you. So, you're seventy years old, of Spanish descent, and you used to work as a tour guide. And you and your wife both have private insurance. That’s excellent. Now, let's talk a bit about your current health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I get a little tired, you know, old age creeping in. But nothing bad. No big pains or anything. My wife keeps me going, makes sure I eat right. I sleep okay, I guess. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but who doesn’t? I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Everything’s always just kinda… worked. I don’t want to bother nobody if I don’t need to, ya know? But my boy, he was worried. Said I needed a check-up before tryin' out for… whatever it was.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Murph. It's admirable that you've been managing on your own for so long, and it's good that your son is encouraging you to get checked out. It's always best to be proactive about your health. To get a clearer picture of things, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. My wife handles most of that. I take… a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. Something blue. And sometimes, if my knee acts up, she gives me something for that. White pill, small one. I don't remember the names, sorry. She writes it all down. I just take 'em when she tells me to. I don’t really pay attention to what they are, just that they help. Is that bad? I never liked taking pills much to begin with.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad at all, Mr. Murph. It’s common for people to leave the details of medications to a spouse, especially if they’re managing well. It’s perfectly alright. Do you know why you are taking those medications – for example, were you diagnosed with high blood pressure at some point?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think so. The doctor a long time ago said somethin' about it. He said my numbers were… too high. Somethin' like that. I don't remember much else. He put me on the blue pill, and I’ve been takin' it ever since. My knee… that just started hurtin' after I got older, you know? From all the walkin' I used to do, I guess. Never went to a specialist or anything. Just a little cream and the white pill when it really bothers me. It’s never really bad bad, just… achy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Murph. That's very helpful information. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think real hard… I was a little boy when my appendix burst. That was a long time ago, of course. And… oh! My wife had to go in once, when she broke her arm. I stayed with her the whole time. But me? Not really. I broke a rib once, fallin' down the stairs, but I just went to the emergency room and they wrapped it up. Never had to stay overnight or anything. Just a little bit of pain and then it healed on its own. I try to stay outta hospitals if I can, ya know? Not a fan of those places.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand, Mr. Murph. It's good to know you haven't had any significant hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family, is there any history of serious medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… she had a bad heart. Real bad. She passed away when I was young, from heart trouble. And my father, he had… somethin' with his sugar. Diabetes, I think my wife said. He had to watch what he ate real careful. And my sister… she got sick, a bad sickness, a long time ago. Cancer, I think it was. But that was a long time ago. She’s… she’s not with us anymore. It feels like a long time ago. Does that help? It was a long time ago. They all lived a long life, though, even with those sicknesses.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Murph. It’s helpful to know about your family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. It sounds like you've experienced some loss in your family, and I'm sorry for that. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… well, I don't do much anymore. Mostly just relax at home with my wife. Watch TV, read the paper. Used to be real active, you know? Walkin' all day with the tourists. But now… not so much. I try to eat healthy, my wife makes sure of it. Lots of vegetables, not too much sugar. I used to drink a little… a little beer sometimes, but not much anymore. Doctor said it wasn’t good for my blood pressure. I don’t smoke, never have. Pretty quiet life these days. Just takin' it easy. I don’t need much excitement anymore.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Mr. Murph. It's good that you're prioritizing rest and healthy habits. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just try to be gentle, okay? Old bones ain’t what they used to be. Do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Murph. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. I’ll make a note of that. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? My heart sounds… funny? I don't feel nothin' wrong. Just a little tired sometimes, like I said. But a murmur… that doesn’t sound good. I hope it’s nothin’ serious. I don't want to cause no trouble.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be concerned, Mr. Murph. A murmur is simply an extra sound heard during the heartbeat. Many murmurs are harmless – they’re often caused by normal blood flow through healthy heart valves. However, it's important to investigate further to rule out any potential underlying issues. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong, but we'll need to do some further evaluation to be certain. Now, I'll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or organomegaly. Now, I’ll check your extremities for swelling and pulses. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. No edema noted. Alright, Mr. Murph. That concludes the physical exam. Based on my findings, I’d like to order a few tests to get a more complete picture of your health.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I don’t like tests. Are they gonna hurt? I don't do well with needles, and I don't want to have to lie in one of them machines. Just tell me what you need to know, I'll tell you! I don't want to go through a lot of fuss. My wife… she gets worried when I have tests. She always thinks the worst.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Murph, and I want to assure you I’ll only order tests that are necessary. We'll take things one step at a time. First, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These are all simple blood tests that will give us information about your overall health, including your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. As for the potential for needles, these are routine blood draws, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. I’d also like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us evaluate the murmur I detected. It involves placing small, adhesive electrodes on your chest and arms. Finally, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. This is a quick and painless imaging test. These tests will give us a clearer understanding of your health and help us determine if any further treatment is necessary. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… I guess so, Doctor. If you really think it’s necessary. I don't like it, but I don't want to cause you trouble. Just… just try to be quick, okay? And tell the lady with the needle to be gentle. My arm gets sensitive. And the machine… the one for my heart… will it be loud? My wife… she doesn't like loud noises. So, blood tests, a picture of my heart, and a picture of my lungs… and that’s it? No big fuss?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph, that’s correct. Blood tests, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. And I assure you, we'll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable and quick as possible. The phlebotomist is excellent, and I'll let her know about your sensitivity. As for the EKG, the machine does make some beeping sounds, but it’s not overly loud. The technician will explain everything before we begin. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and your wife. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it, Doctor. Just get it over with as soon as you can. And thank you… for bein’ patient with an old man. My wife… she’ll be glad I came. She always worries. She’ll want to know everything, though. She’s a worrier. And tell the lady with the needle again… be gentle. That’s all. Can I go now? I’m a little tired. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Murph. It was my pleasure. And I will certainly remind the phlebotomist to be gentle. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the EKG and chest X-ray. Here are the instructions for the blood tests. Please fast for 12 hours beforehand, and drink plenty of water afterward. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. You’ve been very brave today, Mr. Murph, and I appreciate your patience. Please rest, and we'll see you soon. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day.
