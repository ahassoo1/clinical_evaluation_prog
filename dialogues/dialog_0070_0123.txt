DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itchiness, you see. It’s been bothering me for…oh, I don’t know, a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer. It's all over, really. Mostly my arms and back, but everywhere feels a little…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Cassimatis. A generalized itchiness for a couple of weeks. That’s certainly bothersome. Could you describe the itchiness to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a rash, Doctor. There's nothing on the skin, you see? Just…itchy. It comes and goes, but it’s always there, kind of. Sometimes it’s worse at night, keeps me from sleeping good. It's not painful, just…irritating. Like when your clothes feel a little scratchy, but all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. An itch without a visible rash. And it's worse at night, disrupting your sleep. We'll certainly try to figure this out. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Not really. I haven't changed my soap, or laundry detergent. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. I haven’t been traveling. Oh! My grandson, little Miguel, he came to visit for a week last month. He’s got a dog, a fluffy little thing. I was playing with the dog a lot, hugging him, letting him lick my hands…could it be something from the dog? I don’t know much about allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's a very good observation, Mrs. Cassimatis. Exposure to a new animal could certainly be a factor. We'll need to consider that. Now, besides the itchiness, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. No fever, no tiredness…well, maybe a little tired, but that’s just because of the itching keeping me up. And I'm seventy, you know? I get tired easier these days! No bumps, no swelling, nothing like that. Just the itch. And it's…well, it's embarrassing, honestly. You want to scratch all the time!
DOCTOR: I understand it can be very frustrating, Mrs. Cassimatis. And embarrassing, yes. It's good you've told me it's only the itchiness and no other symptoms. Let's go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now. The doctor took me off the medicine about ten years ago. And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to walk every day, you know, to keep moving.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mrs. Cassimatis. Walking is excellent. So, controlled high blood pressure in the past and a hysterectomy long ago. No other significant medical issues. And have you had any surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Oh, years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was...oh, goodness, maybe twenty years ago? And I've had a few fillings, of course. But nothing major, really. Just the gallbladder and the hysterectomy, and the usual dental work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal and hysterectomy. And you mentioned a few fillings. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat everything. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicine I’ve ever taken. I take a little over-the-counter pain reliever for my arthritis sometimes, but that’s it. And I’ve never had a problem with that. I haven't been stung by a bee or anything like that either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. And just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even if they are over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Like I said, just the pain reliever when my arthritis acts up, Doctor. It’s called…let me see…ibuprofen. The regular kind you buy at the store. I don’t take it every day, only when I need to. Maybe a couple of times a week, if that. Sometimes not even that. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. But that’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and vitamin D supplements during the winter. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, when she got older. And her mother…my grandmother…she had arthritis, bad arthritis. And my brother, he’s got high blood pressure, like I used to. But other than that…not that I know of. No skin problems, no allergies… mostly just the usual old age things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes in your mother, arthritis in your grandmother, and high blood pressure in your brother. That gives me a good start. And finally, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Not me. I never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it, but I made him stop right away. And I don't drink alcohol either. It never agreed with me. And I certainly don't use any… recreational drugs! I’m a respectable woman! I drink chamomile tea before bed, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mrs. Cassimatis. Very good habits. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, with all that information, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold. My skin is a little sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Cassimatis. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mrs. Cassimatis, your skin looks remarkably clear. No visible rash or anything alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good there as well. Now, a quick neurological check...can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I’ve always had a good grip, you know. I used to help my father in the garden. Lots of digging and planting.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And very strong. Good reflexes. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, which makes it a little more puzzling. Now, given your symptoms and the lack of any obvious findings, it could be several things. It could be a mild allergic reaction, despite no visible rash, perhaps to something environmental. Dry skin can also cause itchiness, especially with age. And sometimes, itchiness can be a symptom of underlying conditions, though, based on everything you've told me and my exam, that seems less likely. To rule out some of the more common causes, I’d like to order some basic blood work. It will check your thyroid levels, liver function, and a complete blood count. This will give us a clearer picture and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I don't mind getting blood work done. It's just a little pinprick, right? I just hope it doesn't take too long to get the results. I want to stop itching!
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Cassimatis, it’s just a small pinprick. And you're right, we want to get this resolved as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes about three to five business days to return the results. In the meantime, I recommend using a hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to avoid scratching, as that can worsen the itchiness. And, to help with the nighttime itching, you might try an over-the-counter antihistamine like diphenhydramine, but be aware that it can cause drowsiness. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. Hypoallergenic moisturizer…I can do that. And I think I have some of that diphenhydramine at home. I used it when I had a little cold last winter. Um…yes, I do have one question. You said it could be something else… something serious? Should I be worried? I get a little anxious, you know.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Mrs. Cassimatis, and it's good you asked. While it could be a sign of an underlying condition, based on your medical history and the thoroughness of my examination, it’s much more likely to be something benign, like an allergy or dry skin. The blood work is simply to rule out anything more serious, just as a precaution. We’re being proactive, not reactive. I want to reassure you that I’m not overly concerned, but I always believe in being thorough. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a fever, severe fatigue, or notice any other unusual symptoms – please contact the office immediately. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…reasonable. Benign, you said? That’s a good word. As long as it’s not something serious. I can try the moisturizer and the diphenhydramine. And I will contact the office if anything changes. You have my word. Thank you, Doctor Abady. You seem like a very careful doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Cassimatis. I always strive to be. And thank you for your trust. Okay, I'll have the lab requisition printed for you. It’s just a standard blood draw, so you can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. The results will be sent directly to the office. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week sounds good, Doctor. Plenty of time for the moisturizer to work its magic, hopefully. And I'll try not to scratch too much. I always scratch when I’m nervous. Just let me know what lab to go to. I don’t have insurance, so I’ll need to find one that… well, that I can afford.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll print out a list of labs in the area with their contact information and, to the best of my knowledge, their pricing for basic blood work. We can discuss options if you’re concerned about the cost. Here you go. And don't worry too much about the scratching. It's easier said than done, I know. We’ll get this figured out. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mrs. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and not dismiss it as just…old age. I appreciate your patience. And I’ll make an appointment for next week, as soon as I get the blood work done. Have a good day, Doctor Abady. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Cassimatis. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well, and I hope you find some relief soon.
PATIENT: I will. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye. .
