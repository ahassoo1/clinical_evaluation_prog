DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, is it?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes, Wynell. Wynell Gunasekara. Though, truthfully, I haven't been called that by anyone but a doctor in… well, a very long time. What’s this about anyway? I don’t recall scheduling anything.
DOCTOR: Medicare sends us a lot of patients for annual check-ups, you know how it is. Just routine stuff. Though, frankly, at your age... well, let's just get on with it. What's been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Honestly, young lady, what makes you think anything is bothering me? I came because they sent me, not because I suddenly sprouted aches and pains. At my age, you expect things to be a little… worn, you know? It doesn't mean I need poking and prodding. It's just… presumptuous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Presumptuous. Fine. Let's start with the basics then. Any major illnesses you've had?
PATIENT: Major illnesses? Goodness. That’s… a long time ago. I had a touch of the flu, I suppose, years and years back. Nothing serious. And… my first husband, bless his soul, he always said I had a weak constitution. But that was just him being dramatic, probably. Honestly, I can’t recall anything major. It's all a bit of a blur, you know how it is when you’ve lived a long life. Are we getting somewhere with this? Because truthfully, I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes, there was… something with my foot, years ago. A bunion, I believe? It was terribly painful, I remember that much. Though, who did it, where it was… all a bit hazy. It was a long time ago, and frankly, doctors all look the same after a while, don’t they? Just poking around. It wasn't a pleasant experience. Is that what this is going to be? More poking?
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. That's a… complicated question. My mother was… a strong woman. Very proud. And my father… he was a sailor, I think. Spent a lot of time away. Honestly, I wasn't very close to either of them. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses or… anything, really. I had a brother, I believe, but he moved to America a long time ago and I haven't heard from him since. Is this important? What are you trying to find out? It all feels very intrusive.
DOCTOR: Social history. Do you drink?
PATIENT: Drink? Well, I used to enjoy a small glass of sherry with my dinner, now and then. Just a little something to… settle the stomach, you know? But that was years ago. I haven’t touched a drop in… oh, goodness, I can’t even remember how long. I’m not much of a drinker, never have been. A bit of a waste of money, if you ask me. Do you drink? You seem rather… focused.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, land sakes. Let me think. I don’t think so. I've always been fairly robust. Maybe a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but nothing serious enough to warrant… medication or anything. Honestly, all these questions are making me feel unwell. Is this really necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated, not examined.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, dear. Let me see... I take something for my…well, my joints. They ache a bit, you know, the usual. A little white pill. And something for my…blood pressure, I think. Another little pill. I can't recall the names of them, truthfully. My daughter used to keep track of all that for me, but she moved away… Honestly, I just take what the doctor tells me to take. It's all a bit of a blur. Is that helpful? I'm not very good with names and dates, you see. It's all rather…fading.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam then. Blood pressure first. 150/90. Not ideal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds… a little irregular. Lungs… clear. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Diminished. And finally, a quick check of your feet. Some swelling and… signs of neuropathy.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? What’s that? And what did you say my blood pressure was? 150… something? That sounds terribly high. What does “irregular” mean, exactly? Are you saying something is wrong with my heart? Honestly, all this poking and prodding and now you're telling me things I don't understand. I came here because they sent me, not to be frightened with medical jargon. .
DOCTOR: Look, we need to discuss your blood pressure and some potential nerve damage in your feet. But honestly, I’m double-booked, and this is going to take time. I’m going to write you a referral to a cardiologist and a podiatrist. You really need to see specialists. And frankly, I'm out of time. Here. Schedule appointments as soon as possible. Next!
