DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. My husband, Harold, insisted. Something about… a check-up? I just moved here, you see, and he worries terribly. It's all rather… unnecessary, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of Harold to be so attentive, and routine check-ups are often a good idea, even when we’re feeling well. They can help catch things early. So, even though you feel perfectly fine now, let's go through some standard questions just to get a good baseline of your health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Baseline? Really? At my age, dear, what baseline are we talking about? I’ve lived a long life. A very long life. And I assure you, I know my own body. But… fine. Ask your questions. Just try to be quick about it, please. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. And you are right to know your body – that's invaluable. These questions are just to make sure we haven't missed anything. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions over the years?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Harold keeps all those papers. He’s terribly organized. I… I had something with my… gallbladder, I think? Years ago. A very unpleasant affair. And… something with my blood pressure, perhaps? Honestly, it was so long ago, and frankly, it wasn't terribly serious. Doctors these days… always fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder and potentially some history of blood pressure issues. We’ll try to get those records from Harold if you're comfortable with that – it would be helpful to have specifics. Do you recall if you needed any surgeries at any point?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Good heavens, no. I’ve always prided myself on my good health. I was very active, you know. Used to dance. Beautifully, I might add. Although… there was that little thing with my… bunion. Harold insisted. Said it was affecting my gait. A perfectly ridiculous procedure, if you ask me. And terribly painful. But, yes. One bunion surgery. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, one bunion surgery. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that’s been common amongst your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, dear. That’s a long story. My mother… well, she lived a long life too. A very long life. And she was… rather stoic, you see. Didn't believe in doctors either. My father… he had something with his… digestion, I think. Always complaining about his stomach. And an aunt… I believe she had… the vapors? Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. It all seems so… morbid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to recall family medical history. Even a general sense – like if heart problems or certain illnesses were common – can be helpful. We can also sometimes access records if you’re comfortable with that. Let’s move on to something else. Could you tell me a bit about your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, just the usual. A little something for my… joints. Harold brings it home. And a tiny pill for… sleeplessness, sometimes. Though I don't really need it. I sleep just fine. Unless Harold is snoring, of course. And… something for my… water retention, I think. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. Harold manages all that. He likes to be in control.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for your joints, sleeplessness occasionally, and water retention. It’s good that Harold helps with that, but for my records, could we perhaps get a list of the exact names of these medications?
PATIENT: Goodness, you're persistent, aren't you? Honestly. I haven't the foggiest idea what they're called. Little white pills, mostly. And a pink one, I believe. Harold has them all organized in those… blister packs. It’s all very confusing. I'm a woman of… leisure, you see. I don't concern myself with such trivial details. Perhaps you should ask him.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly alright. Knowing the specific names helps us avoid any potential interactions or side effects, but we can certainly get that information from Harold. Now, just to finish up this part, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I eat everything. I've always had a strong stomach. Though… I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to some… shellfish, once. A very long time ago. But that was probably just a bad oyster. And… I think I sneezed a bit when I was around cats as a child. But I don’t really have allergies, dear. Honestly. I'm a very robust woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a reaction to shellfish and a possible mild sensitivity to cats. Thank you for letting me know. Now, Candice, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just to check your heart, lungs, and general health. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Really. I assure you, Doctor, I know perfectly well how my body functions. But… fine. Get it over with. Just try to be gentle. And don’t poke around too much. I have a luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll be quick. Okay, Candice, I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, but a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning at this age, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. And your pulse is 78, also within a normal range. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Okay, Candice. That concludes the basic exam. Everything seems generally well, but there are a few things we should discuss further.
PATIENT: “A few things?” I knew it. I knew you’d find something. Honestly, doctors always find something. A murmur, elevated blood pressure… it’s all very unsettling. I feel perfectly fine, you know. Perfectly fine. Well, get on with it. Tell me what dreadful ailment you’ve discovered. But please, be quick. My luncheon awaits. And don’t expect me to understand any complicated medical jargon. I'm a woman of simple pleasures, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's not necessarily an ailment, Candice. The slight murmur I heard is common with age and doesn’t usually cause any problems. However, your blood pressure is a little elevated. Consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, so it's something we want to address. Given your age and overall good health, I’d recommend we start with some lifestyle modifications – things like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and reducing stress. We can also monitor your blood pressure at home to see how it fluctuates. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: “Lifestyle modifications?” Honestly. You expect me, at my age, to start exercising and… and worrying about my diet? I eat perfectly well. Harold makes sure of that. And I have a very relaxing lifestyle, thank you very much. Luncheons, bridge… it’s all very civilized. And monitor my blood pressure? I haven't the foggiest idea how to do that. It sounds terribly complicated. Honestly, Doctor, I think I'll just stick to what I'm doing. It's worked for a very long time. Perhaps I should have just stayed home. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candice. It sounds like you have a comfortable routine, and changing that can be difficult. It’s not about making drastic changes, but rather about small, manageable steps to help keep your blood pressure in a healthy range. We can discuss options that fit your lifestyle. For example, a simple walk a few times a week, or making small adjustments to your diet – perhaps reducing salt intake. And I can have a nurse show you how to use a home blood pressure monitor – it’s very easy to learn. Alternatively, we can schedule a consultation with a cardiologist for a more in-depth evaluation and discuss medication options if needed. It’s ultimately your decision, and I want to support you in whatever you choose. Would you be open to either of those options?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Heavens, no. That sounds dreadful. And another appointment? I already have so many social engagements. Honestly, this is all becoming quite overwhelming. Very well. Perhaps… perhaps a nurse could show me how to use one of those… blood pressure machines. But only if it's quick. And easy. And doesn't interfere with my luncheon schedule. And I absolutely refuse to change my diet. Harold makes excellent meals, and I'm not about to complain. But I’m warning you, Doctor. If this becomes too complicated, I'm leaving. I have a very busy life, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. It will be quick and easy, and I'll make sure the nurse respects your time. We can schedule that appointment for a day that works best for you. And we absolutely won't change your diet. We’ll simply monitor your blood pressure for a week or two, and then we can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment. If your blood pressure remains elevated, we can explore other options, but for now, let’s start with monitoring. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you instructions on how to use the monitor. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Candice?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Just… please, tell the nurse to be quick. And don't let her bother me with too much medical jargon. I’m a woman of leisure, you see. Not a medical student. Honestly, I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon. But thank you… I suppose. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll let the nurse know to be quick and keep things simple. I appreciate your willingness to try this, Candice. Thank you for coming in today. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. And please, enjoy your luncheon. .
PATIENT: Very well. Goodbye. And please, tell the nurse to be brief. .
