DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my… my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It just takes me a long time, and it’s not a strong stream, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with your urination – difficulty starting, a weak stream, and it’s been happening for about a month. That definitely sounds bothersome. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, bothersome is a good word for it! It’s… well, I have to push a bit, sometimes. And I feel like I don’t empty my bladder completely, even after I’m done. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… frustrating. And I seem to be going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. It wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pushing to start, a feeling of incomplete emptying, increased frequency, and waking up at night to urinate. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Definitely not. And no pain, really. Like I said, it’s not painful, just… inconvenient. My lower tummy feels… normal, I guess. Nothing hurting there. My back is sometimes a little achy, but that's just my age, I think. I’m 66, you know. Old bones.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that there's no pain or blood, and it sounds like the back ache is likely just age-related, as you said. To get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take lisinopril, I think it's called. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, maybe thirty-five years ago. Is that important? I also have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, high blood pressure managed with lisinopril, and a hysterectomy thirty-five years ago. Medicare is good to know as well. And just to confirm, is the lisinopril working well to keep your blood pressure under control?
PATIENT: Yes, the lisinopril is fine. My doctor checks it every few months, and it’s always good. No problems there. I take one pill every morning. It’s… well, it’s routine. I also try to watch my salt intake, you know. For the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, controlled blood pressure with medication and a healthy diet. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Just the lisinopril, I think. Oh! And I take a calcium supplement. My daughter keeps telling me I need to strengthen my bones, you know, with my age. Just one little tablet every day. And sometimes, when my joints are aching, I take some ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lisinopril, a daily calcium supplement, and occasional ibuprofen for joint aches. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family had problems with kidneys, bladder, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some sort of bladder infection when she was older, I think. She was always a bit vague about it. And my brother, he had some problems with his kidneys later in life, needed dialysis for a while. But that was many years ago, and I don’t really know the details. My father was healthy as an ox, though. Never a sick day in his life!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of bladder infection in your mother and kidney problems requiring dialysis in your brother. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... well, I'm retired now. I used to work at the post office, sorting mail. It was a good job, kept me busy. Now I mostly stay at home. I like to read, do a little gardening, and visit with my daughter when she can come. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t do a lot of heavy lifting, you know, being an older woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, retired, enjoy reading and gardening, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and no heavy lifting. Just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had one in my life. I can eat anything, take most medicines… I’m pretty lucky that way, really. I’ve never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Kandy, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if you're comfortable with that. We'll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. An exam sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. This might be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain. No tenderness to palpation. Now I’ll just check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling and relax?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready. I always hated tests when I was younger. Hopefully, this won't be too bad.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And I’ll just check sensation in your feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little ticklish, maybe, but yes, I feel it. It’s a bit cool in here, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good sensation. And I'm just going to do a quick digital rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will allow me to check the size and tone of your rectum and assess for any masses or abnormalities. It’s a standard part of the exam when looking at urinary issues, but please let me know if you’re at all uncomfortable, and we can stop at any time.
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I understand you’re the doctor, but… it sounds a bit… invasive. Could we perhaps try something else first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Kandy, and I completely respect that. It is a bit invasive, and I apologize for not explaining it more thoroughly upfront. It's helpful in feeling the size and tone of the muscles that support your bladder and rectum, and can sometimes detect subtle abnormalities that we wouldn’t find otherwise. However, it's not absolutely necessary at this stage. We can proceed without it, but it might mean we need further testing to get a complete picture. Would you be comfortable with me ordering a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out infection as a first step?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. A urine analysis and a blood test… that I can do. No poking and prodding, that’s good. Yes, let’s do that. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Thank you for understanding.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll go ahead and write those orders for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. They’ll need a sample of your urine, and they'll draw a little bit of blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Fifteen or twenty minutes, that’s not too bad. I’ll go down to the lab now. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And for being understanding about… everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help. Just let the lab know you’re here for Dr. Ranjan’s orders. And please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this together.
