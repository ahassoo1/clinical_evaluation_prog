DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Gorga. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, gradually, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they’re drooping. It's more noticeable some days than others, but it's definitely happening. I noticed it myself, and a colleague at work mentioned it, too. It’s a bit concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… hmm. Gradual onset is important. And you said a colleague noticed it as well… alright. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you say weakness, can you describe that a little?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's… it’s not like a sudden inability to do things. More like everything takes more effort. Lifting things, even just getting up from a chair… it's like there's less… power, I suppose. And it seems to be worse in the evenings. I work in facilities management, so I'm on my feet quite a bit, doing repairs and maintenance. It's making that harder, naturally. It started with my arms, I think, but it’s spreading to my legs now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Weakness spreading, worse in the evenings… facilities management, so physical work is involved. Right. Any trouble with vision?
PATIENT: Trouble with vision… not really, no. Everything seems clear enough. Though, now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired lately, overall. I sometimes feel a bit… double vision if I'm very tired, particularly towards the end of the day. But I thought that was just from being worn out. It hasn’t been constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent double vision with fatigue is… relevant. And the tiredness, that’s helpful to know too. Any changes in your voice or swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, not that I've noticed. My voice… hmm. That’s a good question. No, I don’t think so. Perhaps a bit quieter lately, but I just put that down to… well, not feeling particularly energetic. I haven’t been singing, if that matters. I used to enjoy a bit of karaoke, but… haven’t felt up to it recently. It's been a while, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover some basics... any fever, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And weight loss… perhaps a little, but I haven’t been eating as much, given how tired I’ve been. Nothing dramatic. As for bowel habits… no changes there. Everything’s been… regular, for lack of a better word. I apologise, I’m not very good at describing these things. I just know I don’t feel right.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, you're doing fine. Alright. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I had a bout of really bad flu a couple of years ago, but recovered fully. No surgeries, no major injuries. I've never been hospitalised, except for the tonsils when I was a child. A very standard procedure, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. Tonsils removed as a child, otherwise healthy. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years ago, from… complications, really. Heart problems, I believe. My father is still living, he’s eighty-seven, but he's not particularly… forthcoming with information about his health. He doesn't like to talk about it. As far as I know, there's no history of muscle weakness or anything similar on either side of the family, but I wouldn't swear to it. I don’t have much contact with my extended family, so I wouldn't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother passed due to heart complications, father is still living, limited information available. Now, let’s quickly cover your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I did try it once, when I was younger, but I didn't enjoy it. I also don’t drink very often. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’m not a regular drinker. I'm divorced, as you can see on the form, and I live alone. I work quite long hours, so I don’t have much of a social life, to be honest. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, but it's difficult when you're tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Non-smoker, occasional drinker, divorced, lives alone, long work hours. And just one more thing before we move onto the physical exam... Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I had a penicillin shot once, a long time ago, and was fine. I've never experienced any food allergies or skin reactions, not that I recall. I’m usually quite careful about what I eat. I haven't taken anything regularly for a while, just the occasional painkiller for a headache. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for all that information. It gives me a better idea of what might be going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I understand. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I’m… rather anxious to find out what’s going on, if I’m honest. Anything that might help is appreciated.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, and relax as much as possible. First, let's check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature... Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Now, let’s look at your eyes... Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Good. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength… Okay, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. I’m trying, Doctor. It feels… a bit harder than it used to. I think. I suppose it’s hard to quantify, really. It’s not painful, exactly, just… requiring more effort. I hope that’s helpful. Is that what you meant? I'm a bit worried, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. And it is noticeable, some weakness in both hands, slightly more pronounced on your left side. Okay, now, push against my hands like you're trying to stand up... And again, with the other leg... Alright. And finally, I want you to lift your arms out to the sides and hold them. Just hold them there for a few seconds...
PATIENT: There. It’s… becoming difficult, Doctor. They feel very heavy. And… they're starting to shake. I can feel the effort it’s taking to keep them up. It’s not comfortable, to be honest. I apologise, I'm not very strong at the moment. I think my left arm is a bit weaker, but it's hard to tell. I just feel… exhausted now. Is that what you needed to see?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for your cooperation. Your arms are noticeably fatigued and have a slight tremor, more pronounced on the left side. The weakness is subtle, but consistent with what you’ve described. Now, I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll discuss some possible causes and next steps. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Alright. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including a condition called Myasthenia Gravis, or a possible nerve issue. It’s too early to say definitively, but these are things we need to investigate.
PATIENT: Myasthenia Gravis? Nerve issue? Those… sound serious, Doctor. Are they… treatable? And what kind of investigation would be required? Will I need… scans, or tests? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. I just want to know what’s going on, and if there’s something I can do about it. I haven't been feeling myself for months now, and it's frightening not knowing. I hope it’s not something too… debilitating. I have a job to consider, and I need to be able to function.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. Those conditions can be serious, but they are often manageable with treatment. It’s good that we're looking into it now. And yes, we'll need some tests to confirm the diagnosis. First, I want to order a blood test to look for specific antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis. We’ll also need to perform a nerve conduction study, which measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles. It’s a painless test, though it can be a little uncomfortable. We might also consider an MRI of your brain, just to rule out other possibilities, but that’s something we can discuss after the initial tests. I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist, who specializes in nerve and muscle disorders. They'll be able to interpret the test results and recommend the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. And if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Neurologist… right. So, more appointments, more tests… It feels like a long road ahead. Difficulty breathing? That is frightening, Doctor. I haven't experienced that yet, thankfully. What about… work? Will I be able to continue working? I need to be able to support myself. And… is it possible this could be something else entirely? I mean, are there other conditions that cause similar symptoms? I'm just trying to prepare myself, if possible. And… how long will it take to get these test results? I understand you're busy, but the uncertainty is… difficult to cope with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schaust. It is a lot to process, and the uncertainty is definitely the hardest part. Regarding work, it's hard to say definitively until we have a diagnosis. However, many people with Myasthenia Gravis are able to continue working, especially if their symptoms are well-managed. We can discuss accommodations with your employer if needed. As for other possibilities, yes, there are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as certain autoimmune disorders, infections, or even medication side effects. That's why it's so important to get a thorough evaluation. As for the test results, the blood test should take about a week to come back. The nerve conduction study will take a bit longer, perhaps two weeks, as it requires scheduling an appointment with a specialist. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please try to stay positive and focus on taking care of yourself. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: A week for the blood test, two weeks for the nerve study… alright. That’s something, I suppose. Something to work towards. I… I think I'm good for now, Doctor. Just… staying positive, as you said. And trying not to worry too much. It's easier said than done, of course. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it. I will await your call. I hope it’s not something too… serious. But I’m glad I came in, and I’m grateful for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. And you did the right thing by coming in. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before my call. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, and try to rest. .
