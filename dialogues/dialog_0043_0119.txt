DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’ll be your physician today. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually complain about these things, you understand. But it’s… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. And it’s… well, down there. From him.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these concerns, and you’ve come to the right place. Many patients experience similar issues, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: More about it? What more is there to say? It… comes out. It’s not a pleasant color, I assure you. A sort of… yellowish-greenish hue. And it has a… smell. A very unappealing smell. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous about hygiene, so this is most unsettling. He's a… a perfectly respectable man, you understand. It just… started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Ms. Wartick. That’s helpful. When you say a few days ago, can you recall approximately how many days ago it started?
PATIENT: Let me see… it must have been… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday. We had… paella for dinner. A lovely paella. So, Tuesday would make it… three days? Perhaps four. It’s difficult to be precise, Doctor. I don’t spend my days… inspecting things, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Wartick. It’s alright if you can’t be precise. Aside from the color and odor, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… there's a slight… burning sensation. Not constant, you understand. Just… occasionally. And a little… discomfort. He’s been a bit… irritable lately, if I’m being honest. Though that could be the heat, of course. It’s been dreadfully hot. And… now that I think of it, he’s been going to the restroom rather frequently. But he drinks a lot of water!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Wartick. To clarify, when you say he’s been going to the restroom more frequently, is it painful when he urinates?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not painful, Doctor. Just… more often. He doesn't scream when he goes, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s just… inconvenient. And rather undignified, frankly. He’s a man of some standing in the community, you know. This whole situation is… upsetting. Really upsetting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick. It’s good to know there’s no pain with urination. Now, have you or he experienced any fever, chills, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Doctor, honestly! We are not savages! Of course not. He’s a very healthy man, normally. I take very good care of him. And I certainly haven’t been feeling unwell. As for pain… well, my back does ache a little sometimes, but that’s just from gardening, you understand. I have a rather lovely rose garden. But that's unrelated. Completely unrelated to… all of this. I simply do not understand why you are asking such… personal questions! It’s most improper!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem personal, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, they are all necessary to understand the full picture and ensure we arrive at the correct diagnosis. I am simply trying to rule out any other possible causes for these symptoms. Now, moving on, have either of you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Doctor! How dare you! That is a most scandalous question! I am a respectable woman, and he is a pillar of the community! I will not answer such an impertinent inquiry! I came here because of a discharge, not to be subjected to… to insinuations! This is outrageous! I demand to see another doctor!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, please accept my sincerest apologies. I did not intend to cause any offense or discomfort. I understand your reaction, and I assure you, it was not my intention to imply anything untoward. I recognize that I may have approached the questioning too directly, and I apologize for that. I will proceed with more sensitivity. To move forward, could you please tell me about any relevant medical history, either yours or your husband's?
PATIENT: Well… he had a bout of… indigestion last year. Quite a bad bout, actually. Required a special diet. And… he had his prostate checked a few years ago. All perfectly normal, the doctor said. As for me… I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. I take some herbal remedies for it. And I had the flu once, many years ago. Really, we are both quite healthy people. This… this discharge is most perplexing. And embarrassing! I simply cannot imagine what could be causing it!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Wartick. It's good to know you both generally enjoy good health. Now, do either of you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I'm aware of. He gets a bit of a rash sometimes after eating shellfish, but that’s not an allergy, per se. Just… a sensitivity. And I once had a slight reaction to some rose fertilizer. A bit of redness on my hands, nothing serious. But other than that… no. We are both very resilient people, you see. We don’t succumb to trivial ailments. Honestly, I suspect this whole thing is just a temporary… irregularity. A little stress, perhaps. Or the heat. It’s been dreadfully hot, as I mentioned before.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wartick. Now, could you tell me about any medications that either of you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Well, as I mentioned, I take some herbal remedies for my arthritis. Mostly glucosamine and chondroitin, and a bit of willow bark. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, you understand. Just… natural remedies. And he takes a multivitamin, just to keep his strength up. Oh, and sometimes he takes an antacid after a particularly spicy paella. But that’s all. We don't believe in flooding our bodies with chemicals, you see. Natural is best. Always best. It's just...this discharge is so unlike us. It's very unsettling, Doctor, very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Wartick. Now, I’d like to ask to conduct a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me to better assess the situation. Specifically, I would like to check your husband’s vital signs, and perform a brief examination of the affected area. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! You want to examine him?! A strange doctor, in a strange office, examining my husband?! That is entirely inappropriate! I came here to discuss a discharge, not to have him… prodded and poked! I think I’ve heard enough, Doctor. I believe I’ll seek a second opinion. A much more… discreet opinion. Good day!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize for making you feel uneasy. I assure you, my intention was solely to provide the best possible care. However, I recognize that I may have pushed too far, too quickly. I respect your decision to seek a second opinion. Here is my card. Should you change your mind, or if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I wish you and your husband all the best.
