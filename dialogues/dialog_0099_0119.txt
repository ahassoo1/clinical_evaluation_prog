DOCTOR: Right. Jinnie Wartick, 57 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Yes. It’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? It’s… a problem. A personal problem, with… discharge. A man has been… exhibiting some… unpleasantness. And it’s concerning. It just isn’t hygienic.
DOCTOR: A…personal problem, you say. Concerning hygiene. Right. I see. And you're concerned about discharge… from this man?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Precisely. From him. It’s… quite noticeable, and frankly, unseemly. It’s not something one expects, is it? I mean, a gentleman should maintain a certain… standard. And this is… well, it’s falling short. I’ve tried to… gently suggest better cleanliness, but he doesn’t seem to understand the gravity of the situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's clarify. Are you experiencing this discharge yourself, or are you concerned about a partner?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. It’s… a gentleman friend. A recent acquaintance. I am merely concerned for his… well-being, and, frankly, my own peace of mind. It’s very unsettling, you see. One doesn’t want to be… exposed to anything untoward.
DOCTOR: So, you are concerned about a male partner exhibiting discharge. And you’ve attempted to… counsel him on hygiene. Is this discharge new, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: It’s… relatively new. We’ve only been… associating for a few weeks. Perhaps a month? It started about a week ago, I'd say. At first, I thought it might be… a temporary thing. But it hasn’t cleared up. And frankly, it’s getting worse. I worry it might be… contagious. Though I assure you, I have maintained strict boundaries.
DOCTOR: A month of association, a week of discharge… and you're concerned about contagiousness. Has he mentioned any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: No, he hasn’t. He’s… not a very communicative man, to be honest. Rather reserved. He grunts a lot. And when I do attempt to discuss… personal matters, he changes the subject. He’s a bit… rough around the edges, you see. Not the type to openly discuss… bodily functions. Which is precisely why I’m here. Someone has to take charge.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no reported symptoms from him beyond the discharge. And limited communication. Is this discharge… what color is it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Color… Well, it’s… not a pleasant shade. It’s… yellowish. A sort of… murky yellow, with… bits in it. Honestly, it’s quite disturbing. I didn’t get a very close look, naturally. One doesn’t simply stare at such things. But it wasn’t… clear. Definitely not a healthy color. More… sickly, if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: Murky yellow discharge with bits… And you say it's new, occurring within the last week. Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. He doesn’t strike me as the type to be bothered by a little discomfort, honestly. And I haven’t observed any… abdominal pain. He mostly sits and watches television. Very stoic, you see. Doesn’t complain. Which is… admirable, in some ways, but also makes it difficult to assess the severity of the situation.
DOCTOR: Right. Stoic. Doesn't complain. So we have a male partner, relatively new association, with a week of murky yellow discharge. Given the color and your description, it's quite likely this is some form of sexually transmitted infection. I’m going to need to examine him to confirm, and we will need to run some tests. Are you willing to… facilitate this?
PATIENT: Oh. That. Well. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. I hadn’t considered… a transmission. I assumed it was merely a lack of proper hygiene. But if it requires a… medical intervention… then yes. I suppose I can… encourage him. Though I doubt he’ll be pleased. He’s not one for doctors, you see. Thinks it’s all a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll need his full medical history, any medications he’s taking, and a urine sample. And, of course, a physical exam. Do you know if he's ever been tested for STIs before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… I haven’t the faintest idea. We haven’t discussed… personal matters of that nature. He’s very private, you see. Medications… possibly? He takes something for his… knees, I believe. An ache, he mentioned. But beyond that… no. And STI testing? Absolutely not. He’d never have entertained such a thing. Honestly, I don’t even think he knows what an STI is. This is going to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. No medical history, possible knee medication, and likely no STI testing. This makes things… significantly more complicated. Look, I understand he's private, but without a history and testing, we’re operating in the dark. We need to rule out serious infections. I strongly advise that he sees a urologist, immediately. I can provide a referral. I’m not comfortable proceeding with a physical exam without a proper background, and frankly, I suspect he'd be unwilling to cooperate fully. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A urologist… Well. That sounds… drastic. I suppose if you insist. He’s a rather stubborn man, you see. Getting him to see any doctor will be a challenge, let alone a specialist. But… I suppose you’re right. Better to be safe than… exposed to something unpleasant. Yes. A referral would be helpful. Though I make no promises that he'll actually go. Honestly, I’m starting to regret ever mentioning this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a referral to Dr. Alistair Finch, a highly-regarded urologist in the area. I’ve noted the concerns about possible STI and the discharge. I strongly urge you to encourage him to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. If he refuses, frankly, I’m limited in what I can do. I’ll also give you a pamphlet on common STIs, just for your information. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For your… patience. And the referral. I truly hope this isn’t… anything serious. And I apologize for bringing such a… delicate matter to your attention. It's just… unsettling. I’ll do my best to… persuade him. Though I fear it will be a difficult undertaking. Perhaps I shouldn't have said anything at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Understandable. It’s always better to be proactive. And don’t hesitate to call if his condition worsens, or if you have any further concerns. I’ll make a note to follow up in a week to see if an appointment was scheduled. Have a good day, Ms. Wartick.
