DOCTOR: Hi Murry, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Rosanova, right? Yes, yes. Well, it’s this… pain. When I breathe deep. It hurts. Not all the time, just… when I try to take a good breath. It’s been… a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days. I just want to figure out what's going on so I can get back to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain when you breathe deep. I understand. And you said it's been going on for a little while. Can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough… roughly? Oh dear. Maybe… a couple of months? Three, four? It's hard to say for sure. I’ve been busy with some… construction work, you see. Keeps my mind occupied. Doesn’t leave much room for remembering little things like… when the pain started. It just… appeared one day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months. And you've been doing some construction work. That’s good to know. Does the pain feel sharp, dull, achy… or something else?
PATIENT: It’s… not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a tightness. A deep ache, maybe. Like something is stretched too far. It’s in my chest, I think… but it's hard to tell. Everything feels a little… worn out, you know? Old. Like me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tightness and a deep ache in your chest. And it feels worse when you take a deep breath. Have you noticed anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse… or better? Let me think. When I’m working, it’s usually okay. Keeps me moving, I guess. But when I sit for too long… or try to lie down… that’s when it feels the worst. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep, sometimes. Not that I sleep much anyway. Old age, you know? Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with sitting and lying down, particularly at night, and better when you're active. Have you had any coughing, fever, chills, or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Coughing… not really. A little bit now and then, but just the usual old man cough. No fever, no chills that I can recall. Shortness of breath… sometimes, when I climb stairs. But I’ve always been a little winded. I’m not a young man anymore! It’s probably just… getting old. I don’t know. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad that you’re noticing changes, it's good you're telling me about them. We just want to make sure everything is okay. Have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes at work?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was younger, foolish, you know? Stopped… oh, maybe thirty years ago? As for dust and fumes… well, construction work. Always dust. And sometimes… fumes. Can’t avoid it. Never bothered me much before, but… maybe that’s it? I don’t know. I just want this pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you smoked in the past, and have some exposure to dust and fumes with your construction work. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health problems like asthma, COPD, pneumonia, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That was a long time ago, Doctor. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but… I don’t remember much of what they said. I had… something with my lungs once, a long time ago. Pneumonia, maybe? When I was a young man, during the war. But that was… a long, long time ago. As for asthma or heart problems… I don’t think so. Never been told, anyway. Everything’s a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had pneumonia a long time ago. That’s helpful to know. And no known asthma or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I think I had something on my knee fixed, years ago. When I was working on a building, fell and hurt it bad. But that was a long time ago. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just… the usual bumps and bruises of a working man. I don’t remember much detail. It was a long time ago, Doctor. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix and knee surgery. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never been much of a pill-taker. Just… a little something for my aches and pains sometimes, when they get really bad. Something I get at the store. But nothing regularly. I like to keep things natural, if I can. Don't believe in loading up on pills unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had any trouble with food. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but nothing serious. As for medications… I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. But again, it was a long time ago, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Can we get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Murry, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and feel your chest. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. Just… be gentle, please. Old bones, you know. And hurry, if you can. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but a little quiet. Your lungs sound a bit… diminished, and I hear some wheezing. I'm going to feel your chest now. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, a little tenderness there. That might be from your work. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen is a little low, at 92%. Normal is usually above 95%. This, along with what I heard listening to your lungs, makes me think you might have some mild COPD, possibly related to your past smoking and exposure to dust. It’s not a definitive diagnosis yet, but it’s something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: COPD? What’s… COPD? Sounds serious. Is that… bad? And low oxygen… I knew I hadn't been feeling well. So, what does that mean? Do I need pills? I really don't want to take pills. I just want this pain to go away. I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It’s a common lung disease, often caused by smoking or breathing in irritants like dust. It makes it harder to breathe, and can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. It can be serious, but it's manageable, especially if we catch it early. Your low oxygen just means your lungs aren't getting enough oxygen into your blood. You're right to be concerned, and you're right, we want to get this pain under control. We'll need to do a lung function test, called spirometry, to confirm if you have COPD. That involves breathing into a machine. We’ll also likely need a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. As for pills, we might need to consider a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways. It’s not the same as taking a pill every day, it's something you would use as needed when you're feeling short of breath. We can discuss all your options. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A machine… an X-ray… inhalers… It’s a lot, Doctor. Too much. I just came in for a little pain in my chest. I don’t want all this fuss. I'm an old man, I've lived a long life. Is it really worth it? Can’t I just… take it easy? Maybe avoid lifting heavy things? I don't want to spend my last years going to doctors and taking tests. Can we just… try that first? Before all the machines and pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Murry. It is a lot to take in, and you're right, it's not ideal. And I respect your wishes. We can try a more conservative approach first. We can focus on avoiding irritants – dust, fumes, anything that makes you cough or feel short of breath. And you're right to think about avoiding heavy lifting. We can also talk about some breathing exercises to help strengthen your lungs. However, I want to be upfront with you. If the pain gets worse, or if you start feeling more short of breath, it's important to get those tests done. COPD, if left untreated, can get progressively worse. For now, let's try those lifestyle changes. I'm going to write you a referral for pulmonary rehabilitation. They can teach you those breathing exercises and help you manage your symptoms. I'll also give you a handout with some information about COPD and how to avoid triggers. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can see how you're doing. If things don't improve, or if they get worse, we can talk about those tests again. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Breathing exercises… okay. And a follow-up. Two weeks. Alright. As long as I don't have to go near those machines just yet. I just want to be able to work. I need to keep busy. Sitting around doing nothing is… no good. So, no machines. And I’ll try to avoid the dust. I’ll do the breathing exercises. And I’ll come back in two weeks. Just… please don’t make me take too many pills. I don't want to be dependent on anything. I think… I think that’s enough for today, Doctor. I’m tired. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Murry. You've got it. We'll take things one step at a time, and I promise to work with you to find the best solution. No pressure for tests right now, and we'll definitely avoid unnecessary medication. Here’s the information for pulmonary rehab, and this handout has some helpful tips. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Yes, you can go now. Get some rest, try those exercises, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
