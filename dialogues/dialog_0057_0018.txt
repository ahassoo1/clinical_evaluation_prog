DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… going to the restroom rather frequently lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s a bit bothersome, and I thought it best to have someone take a look, just to be sure everything is alright. I don’t recall exactly when it started, perhaps a few weeks ago? It’s difficult to say with certainty, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be disruptive, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, I believe. It’s not a sharp change, more of a… gradual increase. And it’s not just frequency, either. The volume seems larger than it used to be with each visit, if that makes sense. I do drink a fair amount of water, naturally, but this feels… beyond that.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and thank you for clarifying. A gradual increase in both frequency and volume is helpful information. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this – anything like increased thirst, feeling tired, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Increased thirst… now that you mention it, perhaps a little. Not dramatically, but I’ve been reaching for water a bit more often, yes. Tiredness… well, I am getting on in years, Doctor. It’s difficult to say if that’s related or simply… age. No pain or burning, thankfully. Just the… constant need to visit the restroom. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Mr. Verbos, and I appreciate you being so open with me. No pain or burning is good. Let's explore this a bit further. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. I suppose it’s… normal? Perhaps a little paler than usual, now that I think about it. And the smell… I haven’t paid particular attention, to be honest. I wouldn't say it's different, but I don’t typically analyze my urine, Doctor. I apologize, I’m not a very observant patient, it seems. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos, it’s not your job to be a medical expert! Pale urine can sometimes be a sign of drinking a lot of fluids, which you mentioned you do. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Existing conditions… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was a long time ago and hasn't caused any trouble. Otherwise… I don’t believe so. My general practitioner always said I was remarkably healthy for my age, but I haven’t seen him in a while. Diabetes… I don’t think so, but I suppose it’s possible? I really don’t recall. Is that something I should be particularly worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the gallbladder removal. We will definitely consider diabetes as a possibility, given the increased thirst and urination. It’s not necessarily something to worry about right now, but it’s important to rule it out. Do you have a family history of diabetes, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a good question. My mother, bless her soul, she had some health issues later in life, but I don’t recall specifically diabetes. She had problems with her… circulation, I think. And my father was quite robust, lived to a good age with no major complaints. Kidney problems… no, I don’t believe so. Nobody that I recall. It was a very long time ago, and families don't always discuss these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Okay, good to know. Now, a few questions about your daily habits. How much fluid would you estimate you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I enjoy my tea, certainly. Perhaps… three or four cups throughout the day? And I drink water with my meals, and occasionally throughout the afternoon. I wouldn’t say I excessively drink, but I stay hydrated, naturally. Perhaps… six to eight glasses total, if I had to estimate? It’s hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight glasses isn't excessive, that’s fairly normal. And finally, are you taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a small dose of aspirin daily, as recommended by my previous doctor, for… well, for general health, I suppose. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol. Nothing else, really. No supplements, no herbal remedies, nothing like that. Just the aspirin and the occasional paracetamol.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Aspirin and paracetamol are helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief abdominal exam. It will just take a few minutes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I do hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I don’t feel any masses or unusual swelling. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Everything seems within normal limits on the initial exam, Mr. Verbos. However, given your increased urination and thirst, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes and assess your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A urine analysis and a blood glucose test… absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this. So, how do we proceed with those tests? Will I need to come back for another appointment? And… will there be any discomfort involved? I always worry about needles, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to be concerned about needles, Mr. Verbos. We'll get through this. For the blood glucose test, we’ll just need a small sample of blood, drawn from your arm – a standard blood draw. The urine analysis will require you to provide a sample of urine. We have a private restroom available for that. The blood draw will have a brief pinch, but it's usually very quick. We’ll send the samples to the lab and I should have the results back in a couple of days. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for August 5th, to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that date work for you?
PATIENT: August 5th… yes, that should be fine. A brief pinch… I can manage that, I suppose. It’s just… I don’t care for needles. But if it’s necessary, it’s necessary. And the restroom is nearby, you say? Excellent. So, to be clear, I’ll provide a urine sample and have some blood drawn, and then we’ll reconvene on August 5th? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid drinking fluids, perhaps? Or a specific diet?
DOCTOR: Exactly, that’s correct. You’ll provide a urine sample and we’ll do a quick blood draw. And no, you don’t need to restrict fluids or change your diet before the tests. Please just continue with your normal routine. It’s best to have a baseline that reflects your typical habits. I’ll have the nurse come in and show you where the restroom is for the urine sample, and then she’ll take you to the lab for the blood draw. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I’m ready whenever the nurse is available. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind before the nurse arrives. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Let me just make a quick note of our discussion for the chart… ...Okay, perfect. I’ll have the nurse come in right away.
