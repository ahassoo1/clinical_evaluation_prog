DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I am here for… a check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? It is required, I understand. I do not like wasting time, so we should be quick.
DOCTOR: A required check-up, alright. And you’re correct, getting it done promptly is sensible. However, even a “required” check-up benefits from a thorough understanding of your overall health. To be efficient, let’s start with the basics. Do you have any specific concerns besides fulfilling the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not really. I feel… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. What more is there to discuss? This seems like a lot of questions for something simple. Are you sure this is all necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, “feeling fine” is a good starting point, but it doesn’t negate the need for a proper assessment. We need to establish a baseline for your health, even if you aren’t actively ill. It’s preventative medicine. Now, let's proceed. Have you had a recent physical exam by another physician?
PATIENT: No. Not recently. It has been… many years. Back home, things were different. We only went to the doctor when something was wrong, not just to… check. Is this a normal thing in America? To have doctors look at you when you are not sick? It seems a waste of money.
DOCTOR: It is common practice here, Mr. Barban. The goal is to identify potential issues before they become serious – early detection improves outcomes significantly. It's a different approach, certainly. Alright. In that case, we have quite a bit to cover. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Chronic… what did you say? No. Nothing. I have never been told I have any… conditions. My father had… problems with his stomach, but that was a long time ago. I do not know the name of it. I work with food, you see. Sometimes I have a little… discomfort, but that is normal, yes? From the spices.
DOCTOR: I see. “Chronic conditions” refers to long-term illnesses. Alright, stomach discomfort is noted. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I am a healthy man. I do not go to hospitals. Too many… germs. And expensive, yes? I avoid them. I fix things myself, if I need to. I do not need people cutting me open.
DOCTOR: Very well. No surgeries. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: My family? Hmm. My father, like I said, stomach. My mother… she lived a long life. Old age, mostly. My sister, she has… children. They are healthy, I think. We do not talk much about health. It is bad luck to speak of such things, you know? It makes it happen.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes cultural beliefs influence how we discuss these things. Alright. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. It is a foolish habit. Bad for the lungs. My father used to… a little, when he was younger. But I do not. It is expensive, and smells terrible. I prefer tea. Very strong tea.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you consume?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not much. Sometimes, with dinner. A small glass of wine. Or a beer with friends. I do not drink to get… drunk. Just to relax. It is not a habit. I do not need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. All kinds of spices, fruits, vegetables… everything. I have never had a reaction. I am a strong man. My stomach handles it all. Perhaps a little… discomfort sometimes, but not an allergy. I do not believe in allergies. People are too sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I do not take anything. I do not like putting things into my body that I do not need. Maybe… sometimes I take something for a headache. But it is rare. Just… a pill from the store. I do not know the name. It is… red and white, I think? It is not important.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your reluctance to share details, but even seemingly minor things can be important. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam to get a baseline assessment. Could you please step onto the scale so I can get your weight?
PATIENT: A physical exam... fine. But do not take too long. I have things to do. Yes, the scale. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright, 90 kilograms. And your height is documented as 188 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 25.5. A little above the ideal range, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please remove your shirt and lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? In front of you? Is this necessary? I do not understand why you need to see my… body. I am a respectable man. This is… uncomfortable. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, it is standard procedure to auscultate your heart and lungs for any abnormalities. It is a necessary part of a physical examination, even if you are feeling well. We are not looking for anything specific, but it is important to establish a baseline. If you are uncomfortable, we can proceed with the exam with your shirt on, but it will limit my ability to assess your condition accurately. However, I assure you, this is a routine procedure performed daily. If that is not acceptable, we can stop here, and I will document the incomplete exam. It will, however, limit the scope of care I can provide. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. And do not look. This is ridiculous. I feel like I am being treated like a child.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will need to check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. This is taking too long. I have important things to do, you know. And be gentle. I do not like pain.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not critically high. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back with your knees bent. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Hmmph. This is uncomfortable. A little discomfort here… sometimes. From the spices, you know. I work with food. It’s normal. Don’t press so hard. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but I’m noting some mild tenderness in the epigastric region. It’s likely related to your occupation, as you mentioned, but we should investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed.
PATIENT: Hmmph. Stop that. It feels… strange. Is this really necessary? I am perfectly healthy. You are wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are normal. Examination complete. Based on this limited assessment, and your reported history, your blood pressure is slightly elevated and there is mild tenderness in your upper abdomen. Given your occupation, this tenderness is likely related to your work, but elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. I recommend a blood test to assess your cholesterol, glucose, and kidney function. Additionally, a complete blood count would be beneficial. Would you like me to order these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More… poking and prodding? No, thank you. I do not want any more needles. I feel perfectly fine. This is ridiculous. Just tell me I am healthy and be done with it. I do not understand why you need to do all this. It is… unnecessary. I think I will find another doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your reluctance, but I have a professional obligation to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes identifying potential health risks. While you may feel fine now, these tests can help us establish a baseline and detect any underlying issues before they become serious. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, I respect your decision. I will document the incomplete examination and your refusal of further testing. If you change your mind, please do not hesitate to schedule another appointment. .
