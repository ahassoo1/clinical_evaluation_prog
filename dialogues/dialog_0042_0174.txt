DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. I’m here because, frankly, I haven’t been myself lately. I just… I feel very low. It's been going on for a bit now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t really do talking about feelings, if you understand. But my daughter insisted.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Nani. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you being here. It’s very common for people to feel this way, and it's good you have a supportive daughter encouraging you to seek help. "Feeling low" can mean a lot of different things. Could you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s not… sadness, exactly. Though there is some of that, I suppose. More like… a heaviness. A lack of… joy, for want of a better word. Things don't feel good anymore. Even things I used to enjoy. Ski patrol used to be exhilarating, and now… it’s just work. A job. And I sleep a lot. More than I should, I think. It’s difficult to get up in the mornings. And I’ve lost my appetite. Do you… do you understand? It's a bit hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nani, I absolutely understand. What you’re describing – that heaviness, the loss of joy, increased sleep, and decreased appetite – those are all important things to tell me. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life. You mentioned ski patrol - how long have you been doing that?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Nearly forty years, now. Started when I was a young woman, fresh off the boat from Nigeria, really. Needed something to do, you know? Something active. It kept me… grounded. And the mountains… they were beautiful. But like I said, it’s just not the same anymore. It feels… draining. And I worry. I used to be so sharp, so alert. Now… I forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast… nothing serious, but it's unsettling. It's probably just old age, though. Is it not?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve been so active for so long, Nani. That's wonderful. And it’s perfectly normal to have some changes in memory as we get older. However, since you’re noticing a change and it’s concerning you, it's good we're talking about it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m wandering off lost or anything! It's just… little things. Like yesterday, I made a cup of tea, went to find the biscuits, and completely forgot where I put the tea. And then this morning, I couldn’t remember if I’d taken my medication. My daughter reminded me. Small things, really. But they're… frequent. And it worries me because my brother, he… he had problems with his memory towards the end. It wasn't the same, of course, but… well, it’s in the family, you see? I don't want to end up like him.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nani, especially with your brother's experience. It's good you're aware of your family history. It’s helpful information. We’ll definitely take that into consideration as we explore what’s going on. Let's talk a bit more broadly now. Have you noticed any changes in your mood besides this feeling of heaviness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I suppose I've been more… irritable. Snapping at my daughter, which I feel terrible about afterwards. And I don’t really enjoy socializing anymore. Used to love having friends over for cards, but now… it feels like too much effort. I just… prefer to be alone. And I cry more easily, now. Not sobbing, but… a little teary-eyed at silly things. A sad song on the radio, a photograph… things like that. It’s all very… undignified. I used to be a very strong woman.
DOCTOR: It sounds like there’s quite a bit going on, Nani, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. It takes strength to acknowledge these changes, and you are being very strong. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms along with these emotional changes?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms… let me see. Well, my back aches. It always has, with the skiing, but it's been worse lately. And I've been rather tired, even when I do sleep. More than just… sleepy. A deep fatigue. And… my stomach hasn’t been right. A bit queasy, sometimes. Nothing major, just… off. And I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven't been eating much, so that makes sense, doesn't it? It's all probably just old age, I keep telling myself. Though my daughter says I should get it checked out. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: It's good your daughter is looking out for you. While some of these symptoms could be related to aging, it’s important to investigate, especially with the changes you're describing. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure, years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time. And I had a hysterectomy, oh, must be thirty years ago now. Other than that… nothing major. I've broken a few bones skiing over the years, but they all healed properly. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat a balanced diet, get some exercise… well, I used to get more exercise. I haven't been to the doctor much, to be honest. I don't like doctors. Always poking and prodding. But my daughter… she’s made me promise to be more diligent about these things. She's a good girl, that one. A very good girl.
DOCTOR: It's good that your blood pressure is well-controlled, and it’s understandable you don't enjoy coming to the doctor. We'll try to make this as comfortable as possible for you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… just the blood pressure tablets. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… sometimes, a pain reliever for my back, ibuprofen. But not every day, just when it’s really bad. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement. My daughter said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. She worries about everything, that one. Always reading things on the internet. I don't trust the internet. It's full of nonsense. But she means well. Very well.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you are reasonably careful about your health, despite not enjoying being at the doctor. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Nani. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any problems. I eat everything. And I haven't had any reactions to any of the medications I've taken over the years. I’m a fairly robust woman, you see? Strong constitution. Though I suppose that doesn't mean I can't develop allergies, does it? I just haven't had any yet. It's probably just old age, everything getting a bit… sensitive. But I haven't had any allergies, no. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, my brother… he had some trouble with his memory towards the end. Dementia, I believe it was. Not sure what kind. He passed away a few years ago now. My mother lived to be a good age, ninety-two, but she had heart problems. My father… he died young, in an accident. He was a strong man, a farmer. And… I have a daughter, of course. She's very healthy. Always been a strong girl. No major health problems in the family, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. But my brother’s memory… that worries me, you see. It’s in the family, and that’s why I came to see you. I don’t want to end up like him. It's a frightening thought.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nani, and it's good you're aware of your family history. It’s completely natural to be worried. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Still working as a ski patrol, as I mentioned before. Though I’m thinking of slowing down a bit, now. It’s getting harder. And I used to work as a lifeguard in the summers, but I haven’t done that for a few years. It’s too much running around. I live alone now, since my divorce. My ex-husband… well, that’s a long story. We don’t speak much. And I have a daughter, of course. She lives nearby, thank goodness. She visits often. But mostly, I keep to myself. I have a few friends, but we don’t see each other much anymore. It’s… difficult to get out, you see. And I don't enjoy socializing much anymore. It's all a bit… tiring.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Nani. It sounds like you've lived a very active life. Now, have you ever smoked or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I don't like the smell of it. And my mother always said it was bad for you. So I stayed away from it. Never had any desire to smoke, to be honest. And I don't drink much alcohol, either. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But I don't drink regularly. It doesn't agree with me. I prefer a cup of tea. Always have. A nice, strong cup of tea. That’s my vice, I suppose. But no smoking, no. Never.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. Now, finally, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been having trouble sleeping properly, even when I’m tired. I wake up a lot during the night, and then I can’t get back to sleep. And I’ve been feeling… restless. Anxious, I suppose. It's hard to explain. Just a general feeling of unease. And… I’ve lost interest in things I used to enjoy. Reading, gardening, even watching television. It all seems… pointless, now. And I cry more easily, as I mentioned before. Silly things, really. A sad song on the radio, a photograph… It’s all very undignified. And I worry about my memory, as you know. It’s probably just old age, but it worries me nonetheless. Is that… is that everything? I’m probably rambling now. I tend to do that when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: You aren't rambling at all, Nani. You’ve shared a lot of important information with me today, and I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you’re experiencing a number of symptoms that are impacting your quality of life. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I suppose so. But please be quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And don’t be surprised if I wobble a bit. My balance isn’t what it used to be. Skiing takes its toll, you know. But please, be gentle. And try to keep it brief. I have things to do, you see. Though I can’t quite remember what they are… Never mind. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your balance is slightly unsteady, as you mentioned, but no significant deficits detected. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… I can see it. Though it’s a little… blurry. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, either. I need to get a new prescription, I suppose. But it's difficult to get out, you see. And I don't trust those opticians. Always trying to sell you something you don't need. But yes… I can follow your finger. It’s just… a little blurry. And my neck feels a bit stiff. I think I slept awkwardly last night. It's probably nothing. Just old age. Everything aches, you know? Everything feels a bit… out of sorts. Is that enough poking and prodding for now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's quite enough for now, Nani. Thank you for your patience. You’re right, your neck does feel a little stiff. And I noted the slight blurriness you mentioned. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of factors that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. We need to do some further investigation to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. And finally, I think it would be helpful to get an ECG to assess your heart function. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: More tests? Really, Doctor? It's all so… exhausting. But I suppose I have to do what I have to do. My daughter would be furious if I refused. She's very insistent on these things. Yes… alright. Blood tests, cognitive assessment, ECG… whatever it takes. But please, could you explain everything to me in plain English? I don't understand all that medical jargon. And try to keep it brief, if possible. I have things to do, you know. Though I can’t quite remember what they are… Never mind. Just… please explain it in plain English. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I will explain everything in plain English. The blood tests will just involve taking a small sample of blood to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, which can cause fatigue and memory problems. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can also cause similar symptoms. The cognitive assessment is a simple set of questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. It’s not a pass or fail test, just a way to get a baseline and see if there are any areas we need to investigate further. And the ECG is a quick, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart to make sure it’s functioning properly. It doesn’t involve any needles or injections. All of these tests will help us get a better understanding of what's going on and determine the best course of treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Blood tests, check my thinking, check my heart… Alright. But what about… what about my feelings? I told you I feel low, I told you I cry easily, I told you I’ve lost interest in everything. Will these tests tell you that? Will they tell you why I feel so… empty? Or is it just old age? Is that all it is? Everything falling apart? Is that what you’re going to tell me? Because if it is, I don’t know… I don’t know what I’ll do. My daughter… she thinks I’m just depressed. She wants me to see a… a therapist. I don’t like the sound of that. Is that what you’re going to recommend? A therapist?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Nani. And the answer is, yes, these tests can help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Things like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems can sometimes cause symptoms of depression, so it’s important to rule those out first. However, it’s also possible that you are experiencing depression, or another mood disorder. If that’s the case, there are effective treatments available, including therapy and medication. I wouldn’t make any recommendations without getting the results of the tests first. But it's important to know that feeling low, crying easily, and losing interest in things are all signs that something isn’t right, and it’s perfectly okay to seek help. And yes, sometimes therapy can be very beneficial, but we’ll discuss all of your options carefully before making any decisions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Tests first, then… then we’ll see. I suppose I have no other choice. My daughter… she's already looking up therapists, I think. She's very… proactive. But please, could you explain the tests to me again? In plain English? And tell me how long they’ll take? And where will I have to go? I don’t like going to hospitals. They always smell of… disinfectant. And I don’t like needles. I never have. But tests first… Alright. Tests first. Just… please explain it to me again. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. Let me walk you through it step-by-step. First, the blood tests. We’ll take a small sample of blood – about two or three vials. The phlebotomist, the person who draws the blood, will use a small needle, and it's usually over very quickly. It will take about 15-20 minutes, including the time to fill out some paperwork. We can do those right here in the office, in the lab. The cognitive assessment is a simple test that takes about 30-45 minutes. I’ll ask you some questions about your memory, thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. We can also do that right here in the office, in my consultation room. Finally, the ECG will take about 10-15 minutes. We’ll place a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and a machine will record the electrical activity of your heart. That will also be done right here in the office. We’ll schedule all of these tests for you, and we’ll try to get them done as quickly as possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood, thinking, stickers… All here in the office, you say? That's… that's good, I suppose. Better than going to the hospital. But please, could you write all of this down for me? I tend to forget things, you know. And I don’t want to get confused. Write down the tests, write down the times, write down the names of the people who will be doing them. And write down your name and your phone number, just in case. And please… please write it in plain English. I don’t understand all that medical jargon. Just… write it all down for me. And quickly. My daughter will be furious if I forget anything. She's very organized, you see. Very, very organized.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I will write everything down for you in plain English. Here you are. It includes a list of the tests we discussed, the approximate times they’ll take, the names of the staff members who will be performing them, my name and phone number, and some brief instructions. Please read it over carefully, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call my office. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results of the tests. I’m confident that we can get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes… thank you. This is… this is very helpful. Yes. Thank you. I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please, please remind me to bring my glasses to the next appointment. I always forget them. And tell my daughter to stop looking up therapists on the internet. It's… it's unsettling. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. Very, very patient. Alright. I think I’ll go home now. And try to get some rest. Though I doubt I will. And Doctor… thank you. For listening. It helps, you know. Just… being listened to. .
DOCTOR: .
