DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow-looking, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s been happening a couple of times now, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness and a yellowing of the skin… and this seems to correlate with the consumption of fava beans. That is interesting, and certainly warrants investigation. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just feeling a bit sleepy, you know? It's… it’s like all my energy is just gone. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me completely breathless. And it doesn’t get better with rest, really. It’s more than just being tired, it feels… weak. And the yellowing… it starts in my eyes, I think, and then my skin gets it too. It’s quite noticeable, my friend even commented on it last time it happened.
DOCTOR: I see. Profound fatigue, not relieved by rest, accompanied by breathlessness with minimal exertion… and the jaundice, starting in the sclera – the whites of your eyes – then progressing to the skin. And you mentioned this is related to fava bean consumption. To clarify, Ms. Haggar, how many fava beans are you typically eating when this occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s not a huge amount, honestly. Maybe a cupful? Sometimes a bit more if they’re particularly good. My mother used to grow them, and I really like them. I hadn’t realised they could do this. I usually have them with some salad, a summer thing, really. It’s only happened a couple of times in the last few months, but it’s enough to make me worried. I’ve never had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: A cupful, or slightly more, and it’s a seasonal occurrence… That’s helpful to know. And you're right to be concerned, Ms. Haggar. It is unusual. Given the correlation with fava beans, and the jaundice, we need to consider a possible enzyme deficiency. Have you ever been told you have anemia, or any problems with your blood?
PATIENT: Anemia? No, never. No one in my family has, as far as I know. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but nothing serious. I’ve never had any blood tests done before, not that I remember, anyway. Should I have been? I always thought if something was wrong, the doctor would tell me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It’s not uncommon to have never had specific tests done if you’ve been generally healthy. However, given your symptoms and the association with the fava beans, I'd like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll check your complete blood count, liver function, and a few other things to assess for a condition called G6PD deficiency. Have you taken any new medications or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Oh, G6PD… that sounds complicated! No, I haven’t started any new medications or anything. Just my usual vitamins, a multivitamin, really. Nothing special. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. So, blood work, you said? Is that just a little prick of the finger? I’m not terribly afraid of needles, but I don’t enjoy them either. And what does this G6PD thing mean, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: No, not just a finger prick, Ms. Haggar. We’ll need a slightly larger sample, drawn from a vein in your arm. It’s a routine procedure, and our nurses are very skilled. As for G6PD deficiency, it’s a genetic condition where your body doesn’t have enough of an enzyme called G6PD. This enzyme protects your red blood cells. Without enough of it, certain things – like fava beans, or even some medications – can cause your red blood cells to break down prematurely, leading to anemia and jaundice. It’s more common in certain populations, and we want to rule it in or out. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good at all. So, the fava beans are actually causing the problem? And I need a blood draw… Okay. I understand, I think. Red blood cells breaking down… That's why I feel so tired, then? And the yellowing? It's not something serious, is it? Can it be treated? I’m sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions, I’m just a bit flustered, to be honest. I always thought a nice bowl of salad was good for you!
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Haggar. It's perfectly natural to be concerned and want to understand what's happening. You are right, the fava beans may be triggering the problem in this case, if it is G6PD deficiency. The breakdown of red blood cells is what leads to the fatigue and jaundice. It is treatable, absolutely. If it is G6PD deficiency, the main treatment is avoidance of triggers – like fava beans and certain medications. We'll discuss a complete list if the test comes back positive. In some cases, a blood transfusion might be necessary if the anemia is severe, but that's not usually the case. Before we proceed with the blood draw, let me quickly review your past medical history. Have you ever had any major illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager, climbing a tree, but that healed fine. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky. I haven’t had any other illnesses or surgeries. No allergies that I know of, either. I eat everything. Really, I can’t think of anything else. I just hope this isn't something serious. I really don’t want to have to give up my summer salads!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Haggar. No significant medical history, no allergies… That simplifies things. And we’ll do our best to manage this so you can still enjoy your summer salads! Let's proceed with the blood work. I'll write the order now, and then the nurse will come in to draw the sample. It will take just a few minutes. After the results come back, usually within a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. Do you have any questions before we get started?
