DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it’s this unsteadiness, really. I… I’ve been feeling rather off-balance. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not constant, but it’s concerning. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, precisely. It feels like it’s been a little while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that's perfectly alright. It's common for these things to creep up on you. "A little while" is helpful, but let's try to narrow it down if possible. Was it more sudden, like it started after a specific event, or more gradual?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a specific event… You know, that’s… that’s a good question. My husband… he passed away about six months ago. I suppose it could have been around then… everything was rather… blurred, truthfully. I truly don’t remember noticing it before that, but my memory… it isn’t what it used to be. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilyanna, that is very helpful. Experiencing a loss like that is incredibly difficult, and it absolutely can manifest in many different ways, physically and emotionally. It’s not unusual at all for changes to occur around a time of significant stress or grief. So, this unsteadiness… can you describe what it feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… dizziness, not exactly. It’s more like… my feet aren’t quite there, you know? Like they don’t feel firmly planted. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like I’m going to sway, even when I’m just standing still. It's… unsettling. I haven't fallen yet, thankfully, but I've had to grab onto things a few times to steady myself. It’s most noticeable when I’m… walking for longer periods, I think. Or when I’m tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, "feet not quite there" and a sensation of swaying, especially with prolonged walking or fatigue… that gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I’ve been rather tired, as I mentioned. More so than usual, I suppose. And… occasionally, my vision feels a little… blurry. Not constantly, but it comes and goes. Oh, and my hands… they sometimes tremble slightly. It’s not a big tremor, but it's noticeable. Is that… is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilyanna, all of that is relevant. Fatigue, intermittent blurry vision, and hand tremors… those are all pieces of the puzzle. Now, let's go through a quick review of your systems to get a broader understanding. Have you experienced any changes in your hearing or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Changes in my hearing… No, I don’t think so. My hearing seems… normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t noticed any ringing, no. I do sometimes feel a little… muffled, perhaps, when I’m very tired, but I assumed that was just… exhaustion. It's difficult to say, really. My husband used to always say I didn’t listen to him anyway! But no, no ringing specifically.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilyanna. And thank you for sharing that. Now, how about your balance?
PATIENT: My balance…? Well, that's what we're discussing, isn’t it? It’s not good. It feels… off. I used to be quite steady, I believe. I worked… I work with rotary drills, for oil and gas. It requires a fair bit of balance, you see. But lately… it’s been harder. I've been more careful, naturally. I haven't had any falls, but I am… less confident, I suppose. I haven’t been doing as much work lately, because of it. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant, Lilyanna. Thank you for clarifying. It’s good to know about your work – that gives me a better sense of your baseline. Now, let's move onto some other systems. Have you noticed any difficulties with your speech or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No difficulties with my speech, thankfully. And no trouble swallowing either. I eat… normally, I believe. Perhaps a little less than usual, as I haven’t been feeling very hungry lately, but nothing… concerning. I can drink my tea just fine, and I haven’t choked on anything. My taste… it hasn't been quite as strong lately, perhaps, but I assumed that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Honestly, Doctor, it’s… difficult to recall. I used to see a doctor regularly, of course, but… after my husband passed, everything became a bit… hazy. I don’t believe I have any major conditions. I’ve always been… reasonably healthy, I thought. I might have had high blood pressure at one point, but I’m not certain. It was a long time ago. I'm taking some vitamins, but that's about it. I wish I could be more precise, but my memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It's understandable, especially given everything you've been through. We can try to access your records to get a clearer picture, if you're comfortable with that. But for now, let's proceed as best we can. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. And I haven’t been hospitalized, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, in that regard. I’ve broken a bone or two as a child, I suppose, but nothing… serious. Nothing requiring a hospital stay. I’ve always tried to be careful. My husband… he had some heart trouble, a few years ago, and he was in the hospital a couple of times. But I… no, not me. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had some trouble with her joints, arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, later in life. He passed away from a heart attack, I think. My siblings… they seem to be reasonably healthy, as far as I know. No… I don’t recall any neurological conditions. Nothing like… Parkinson’s or anything like that. It’s difficult to say, really. My family… we weren’t very close, to be honest. We didn’t talk about medical things much. I wish I could be more helpful, but my knowledge is… limited.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. You’ve given me a good starting point. Now, let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And… no, I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I always believed in taking care of my health. It’s important, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Lilyanna. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I haven’t ever had a problem with any medications. I’ve had a few vaccinations over the years, of course, but I haven’t ever had any adverse reactions. I’m quite fortunate, in that regard, I suppose. It seems I’m rather… unproblematic, medically speaking. Though, clearly, this unsteadiness is a problem!
DOCTOR: You’re not unproblematic, Lilyanna, and it’s good that you’re seeking help for this. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. I'm hoping we can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, your blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's move on to the neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. And please tell me if you experience any dizziness or double vision while doing this.
PATIENT: Yes, I can follow it… perfectly well, I believe. No dizziness… and no double vision. It’s… quite a simple exercise, isn’t it? Though, my vision does feel a little… strained, perhaps. But that’s likely just from focusing so intently. It’s not related to the exercise, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to assess your balance. I'd like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for as long as possible. I'll time you for 30 seconds. If you feel unsteady, please let me know.
PATIENT: Alright… I can do that. It’s… a little difficult, to be honest. I feel… a bit wobbly. Oh… I think I’m losing my balance… It's worse with my eyes closed, Doctor. Definitely worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that's alright. It’s good you let me know. Your balance is significantly impaired with your eyes closed, and you do exhibit some unsteadiness. Now, I'm going to perform a Romberg test. I'll be watching for any swaying or loss of balance. You exhibit some swaying, and after approximately 20 seconds, you are unable to maintain your position without support. Okay, Lilyanna, that completes the physical exam. Based on my findings – normal blood pressure and pulse, clear lungs, intact reflexes, but impaired balance and unsteadiness, especially with your eyes closed – it suggests a potential problem with your vestibular system, which controls balance. However, there are several other possibilities. We need to rule out other causes before we can make a diagnosis.
PATIENT: Vestibular system… That sounds… complicated. What does that mean, exactly? And what other causes could there be? I’m a bit anxious, to be honest. I’ve never been very good with medical terms. What are the next steps, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Lilyanna, and I'm here to explain everything as clearly as possible. The vestibular system is located in your inner ear and plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation. Problems with this system can cause dizziness, unsteadiness, and difficulty with coordination. However, unsteadiness can also be caused by other things, such as: Neurological conditions: Like multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, although those typically have other symptoms. Medication side effects: Although you're not currently taking any medications, it's good to keep that in mind. Low blood pressure: But your blood pressure was normal during the exam. Vitamin deficiencies: Particularly Vitamin B12. Inner ear infections: Which we can rule out. To get a clearer picture, I recommend the following: 1. Blood work: To check for vitamin deficiencies and rule out other underlying conditions. 2. Vestibular function testing: This is a specialized test to assess how well your inner ear is working. 3. Possibly an MRI of the brain: To rule out any neurological causes. Do those steps sound reasonable to you, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Yes, those steps sound… reasonable. Though, an MRI sounds… a bit daunting, to be honest. But if it’s necessary to rule things out, then I suppose I’m willing. Blood work and a vestibular function test… those sound less intimidating. When can we schedule those, Doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m hoping we can figure this out quickly. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the MRI, Lilyanna. It’s a completely normal feeling. It’s a non-invasive procedure, and we can provide you with information and support to make you feel as comfortable as possible. We can also discuss options for managing any anxiety you might have beforehand. We can schedule the blood work today, and the results should be back within 2-3 business days. I’ll write you a requisition form now. As for the vestibular function testing, I’ll have my nurse schedule you an appointment with the audiology department. They typically have availability within the next week. As we await the results, I recommend avoiding activities that could increase your risk of falling, such as climbing ladders or walking on uneven surfaces. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as double vision, severe dizziness, or difficulty speaking, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding activities that could increase my risk of falling… I can certainly do that. And I will come back immediately if I experience any new or worsening symptoms. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so understanding. I appreciate your help. Now, about that requisition form…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. This will need to be taken to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. I'm also going to have my nurse print out some information about vestibular disorders, just so you have a better understanding of what we’re investigating. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That's all very clear. I appreciate you providing information about vestibular disorders. I’m sure it will be helpful. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I’m looking forward to getting the results, and hopefully figuring out what’s going on. Thank you again for your help, Doctor Gegan. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help, and I’m optimistic we’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well, and please be careful. Take care.
PATIENT: .
