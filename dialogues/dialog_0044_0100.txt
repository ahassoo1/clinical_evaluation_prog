DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um… well, they told me something about a screening? A drug test, I think? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s something the… the company asked me to do, I believe. Something about making sure I'm… safe to operate the equipment. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like this is a workplace-required screening. No worries about the memory – it’s very common. Let me just pull up your information here… Okay, Lytisha Hughston, age 51. And yes, I see a note here about a drug screening requested by your employer. Before we get started with that, is there anything else you're hoping to discuss with me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, 51 already? Time flies, doesn’t it? Um… no, not really. Just the test, I think. Honestly, I don’t come to doctors much. Everything's usually… alright. I mean, I work outside a lot, so I’m fairly active, I suppose. Just… the test. If you need to know anything specific about… what I do, let me know. It's a bit loud, you know, with the machinery.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. We’ll focus on the screening then. And it’s good you’re active – that’s excellent. Just to be thorough, and because I'm always happy to hear about my patients' overall health, could you tell me a little bit about what kind of machinery you operate?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s mostly paving equipment. You know, the big rollers, the tampers… sometimes we do asphalt, sometimes concrete. It’s… loud, like I said. And a lot of vibrations. Been doing it for… oh, a long time now. Longer than I care to admit, really. It’s good, honest work, but it’s… hard on the body, I suppose. That’s why they want these tests, I guess. To make sure I’m still… capable. Is that making sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lytisha. And you're explaining it just fine. Working with heavy machinery like that, the noise and vibrations… those are things we need to consider. It’s good your employer is taking these precautions. Before we proceed with the drug screening, and just to get a good overall picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a bit of a blank, honestly. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… well, a long time. I had… something with my knee a few years back, I think. Work-related, of course. They gave me some pills, and it got better. And… my husband, bless his soul, he always handled the medical stuff. I just… didn’t really pay attention, I suppose. Is there anything specific you need to know? I take a vitamin every day, if that counts. And… I get a little tired sometimes, but that's probably just the work, right?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lytisha, don’t worry about it. Many people aren't regular doctor-goers. We’ll just take things slowly. The knee injury is good to know—do you remember what happened with it, and roughly when it was?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… oh, maybe five or six years ago? I was maneuvering one of the rollers—a big one—and my foot got caught on a bit of uneven ground. Twisted my knee pretty badly. They said something about a sprain, maybe a torn ligament, but I don't really remember the details. They gave me some painkillers and told me to take it easy for a few weeks. And I did, as much as I could. It healed up alright, mostly. Sometimes it aches a bit, especially when it’s cold, but it doesn't stop me from working. I suppose. Do you need to know what kind of roller it was? I don’t even remember the model number, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, the model number isn't important. A sprain or possible ligament tear five or six years ago, and it generally feels okay now with occasional aches in cold weather – that’s helpful. Now, thinking about medications – just the daily vitamin, or anything else you take, even over-the-counter things for headaches or occasional aches?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin, I think. Oh! Wait… sometimes I take something for… heartburn. Tums, I think they're called. Or something similar. It’s only when I eat something… spicy. Or maybe too much tomato sauce. It doesn’t happen often, thankfully. Just when I treat myself to something nice. Not exactly a regular thing, though. I try to avoid spicy food if I can. It's probably just stress, you know? Working outside, worrying about the machinery… it can give you indigestion, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Stress can definitely cause indigestion. Vitamin and occasional Tums for heartburn – good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like food or insects?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm bitten by mosquitoes, but that’s just normal, isn't it? My husband, he was allergic to… bee stings, I think. I remember him carrying an EpiPen. But I've never needed one myself. Nothing serious, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. Just the usual aches and pains from work, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies, just the usual work-related aches and pains. Now, before we move on to the screening itself, just one last thing. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Well… I used to drink, a little. With my husband, mostly. A glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. But… not anymore. Not since he passed away. It just doesn't… feel right. And no, I definitely don’t smoke. Never have. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no. Never been interested in those. I just want to keep working, keep things running smoothly. That’s all. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lytisha. That’s perfectly fine, and I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you’ve made healthy choices. Alright, then. That gives me a pretty good picture of your overall health. Now we can proceed with the workplace drug screening. It will involve a simple urine test. Do you have any questions about that process before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine test. I suppose I knew it would come to that eventually. No, not really. Just… is it a difficult test? Will it take long? I have to get back to work this afternoon, you know. We’re behind schedule already. I just want to get this over with, if that makes sense. I don’t like being away from my work for too long. Things tend to… break down when I’m not there.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple test, Lytisha, and it won’t take long at all. We’ll just need a small sample, and you’ll have privacy in the restroom to collect it. It should take about five minutes total. I understand wanting to get back to work quickly, and we’ll do everything we can to make it efficient. I’ll leave you with some instructions, and there's a collection cup in the restroom. Just follow the directions, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Five minutes, you said? Privacy in the restroom… good. That’s good. I just hope I can… do it properly. It's been a while since I've had to… do anything like this. Alright. Five minutes. I can manage five minutes. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Lytisha. And don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all. I’ll be right here.
