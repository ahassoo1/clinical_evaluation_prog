DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Doctor Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully tired lately, even with the machine I use at night. My regular doctor suggested I come see you about it – something about still being sleepy even though I’m being treated for sleep apnea. It’s just…wearing me down, you know? It’s hard to enjoy things when you’re dragging all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It’s frustrating when treatment isn’t fully resolving the issue. So, you’ve been diagnosed with sleep apnea and are currently using a machine – a CPAP, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A CPAP. It’s…well, it helps, I think. I definitely snore less, my wife says so, bless her heart. But it hasn’t really solved the tiredness. I still find myself dozing off during the day, even after a full night’s sleep, or what should be a full night’s sleep. It’s just…unsettling. I used to be so sharp, you know? Now, I feel like I’m wading through molasses sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like the CPAP is mitigating some of the symptoms, which is good, but not fully addressing the daytime fatigue. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I wake up…usually around 7:00, 7:30. I get up, have a little coffee with my toast, read the newspaper – I still like a real paper, you know? Then I usually do a little work – I’m retired now, but I still do some consulting, mostly reviewing papers for a few universities. I try to get a walk in, weather permitting. Lunch is usually something simple. And then…well, after lunch is when it gets tricky. That’s usually when I start to feel the sleepiness creeping in. Sometimes I’ll try to push through, but often I find myself…well, nodding off in my chair. It’s embarrassing, really. Evenings are pretty quiet – a little television, maybe a phone call with my daughter. I try to be in bed by 10:00. And then I put on the mask and start all over again. It’s…a routine, you know? A tiring routine.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed account, Mr. Paske. It's helpful to understand your daily rhythm. You mentioned feeling sleepy despite using the CPAP. Have you noticed any particular situations that make the sleepiness worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. It’s definitely worse after I eat, especially a bigger meal. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, just the amount, I suppose. And…sitting still for too long, definitely. Like if I’m reading, or watching television. That’s when it really hits me. Driving is okay, thankfully. I think the alertness needed keeps me awake. But if I’m a passenger, especially on a long trip…that’s another story. I have to be very careful. And…social events, sometimes. If I’m talking to people, I can usually manage, but if it's a quiet gathering, or a long lecture…that’s when I have to really fight it. It’s just… frustrating. I used to be able to stay up all night talking, you know? Now, I’m lucky if I make it through an afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. That paints a clearer picture. It sounds like your sleepiness is positional and related to meal size, which is valuable information. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... My regular doctor keeps a pretty good record, but I’ll tell you what I remember. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, that was no fun. And…I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a while back, but it’s been pretty well controlled with medication for years now. I don’t have diabetes, as far as I know. I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which makes walking a little difficult sometimes, but that's about it, I think. Oh! And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully from that. Nothing else major, I don’t believe. I try to stay active, you know? Keep the old machine running as long as I can.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, controlled hypertension, a history of gallbladder removal and pneumonia, and some arthritis. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. For my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, in the morning. And I take a little something for the arthritis – it’s called Meloxicam, 15 milligrams, also once a day. And…sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take Tylenol, as needed. That’s about it, I think. I try to keep it simple, you know? Too many pills can’t be good for you. I also take a multivitamin, but that doesn't really count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a multivitamin doesn’t usually factor into these things. So, Lisinopril 20mg daily, Meloxicam 15mg daily, and Tylenol as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s gone away now. I can eat anything, take any medicine… no allergies at all, as far as I know. My wife always checks when I try something new, just to be safe, but she hasn’t found anything yet. She's a good woman, that one. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. No known allergies is good. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. My father…he had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his 70s. My mother, she had high blood pressure, like me. And… my sister, she has diabetes. She’s doing okay, managing it with medication and diet. As for sleep apnea… not that I know of. Nobody in my family ever snored much, as far as I know. And… cancer, thankfully, nobody in my immediate family has had cancer. My aunt on my mother’s side had it, but that was a long time ago. It’s a bit of a gloomy topic, isn’t it? I try not to dwell on it. You know, live each day as it comes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It is a bit of a gloomy topic, but important information nonetheless. So, family history of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. I never took to smoking, never had the taste for it. And I haven't had a drink in… well, decades. Not since my divorce, really. It wasn't doing me any good. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I was always a bit of a bookworm, you know? Preferred a good story to… well, to anything like that. I keep pretty regular hours, eat a sensible diet, try to get some exercise… I’m a pretty boring fellow, really. A quiet life is a good life, I always say. It’s kept me going this long, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed it has, Mr. Paske. A quiet, healthy lifestyle is admirable. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t felt quite right lately, so I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's check your thyroid. Please extend your neck slightly. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules detected. Finally, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat and check your tonsils. Please open wide and say "Ahhh." Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Tonsils are normal size. Everything appears normal so far. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. My wife always says I have a strong constitution, so I wasn’t expecting anything too dramatic, you know? I always figured the tiredness had to be something else. Happy to hear everything sounds normal so far. Go ahead with the reflexes, Doctor. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your reflexes are within normal limits, good response in all extremities. Now, just one final quick check – let’s do a brief neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Good. Now, I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Excellent, good tracking. Everything appears normal neurologically as well. Based on the physical exam, there are no immediate red flags. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well, that’s all very reassuring, Doctor. No red flags is good to hear. Honestly, I was a little worried it was something serious. But… if everything looks normal, then what is causing this tiredness? I mean, I’m using the machine, I’m getting enough sleep, or at least I think I am… It’s just… frustrating to feel so worn down all the time. Could it be something to do with the machine itself? Maybe it’s not fitted properly, or the settings are wrong? Or… is it just my age, finally catching up with me? I’m not a doctor, you know, so I’m just grasping at straws here. What do you think?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Paske, and a common concern. It's good you're asking these things. While the physical exam is reassuring, it doesn’t always tell the whole story. Several possibilities could be contributing to your fatigue despite CPAP use. It could be related to the CPAP itself – the mask fit, pressure settings, or even the type of machine you're using. We need to rule those out. It's also possible this is related to something else entirely, like a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue , or even early signs of heart failure, despite your current blood pressure control. Given your age and symptoms, and the fact that this has been ongoing, I recommend a few further investigations. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. I’d also like to review the data from your CPAP machine to ensure it’s functioning correctly and the pressure settings are optimal. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this. Check everything you need to check, run all the tests you need to run. Whatever it takes. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to feel like myself again. Review the machine data, check my blood, check my thyroid... do it all. When can we get this started? I’m ready to schedule whatever appointments are necessary. I just… want to feel better, you know? It’s wearing me down, this constant tiredness.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand, Mr. Paske, and we'll get started right away. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood for the labs today. She’ll also schedule you a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. I’ll also send a request to your sleep center to forward me the data from your CPAP machine. In the meantime, continue using your CPAP as prescribed. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, and ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. I'm also going to give you a handout with some tips for managing fatigue while we await the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant swelling in your legs or ankles – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. That all sounds very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain things so clearly. A regular sleep schedule…dark, quiet, cool bedroom… I can manage that. And I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. Thank you for taking this seriously. I feel a bit more hopeful now, just knowing we’re looking into it. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, get you feeling like yourself again soon. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: .
