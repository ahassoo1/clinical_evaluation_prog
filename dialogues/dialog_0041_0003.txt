DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? Tremor. My hand shakes. Been happening… well, I don’t rightly know when it started. A while. It’s annoying, that’s what it is. Mostly when I try to… eat, I guess. Or write. Not that I do much of either anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor, mostly noticeable when you’re eating or writing. “A while” is… understandable. It's tough to pinpoint sometimes. Just trying to get a better sense of things. Could you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: More about the shaking? What do you want to know? It shakes! It's not like a big earthquake, if that's what you’re thinking. Just… a little wobble. Gets worse if I’m nervous, maybe? Or tired. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. My wife… bless her soul… she always said I worried too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wobble, not a large shake. It seems to be affected by nervousness or tiredness. And you mentioned it’s been going on for a while… has it been gradually getting worse, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Gradually? Look, I don't sit around measuring the wobble every day, you know? It comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, others… well, it’s a nuisance. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. Everything falls apart eventually. Don’t tell me it’s something serious, because I really haven’t got the time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's hard to keep track, and you’re right, things can change with age. We want to rule out anything serious, just to be safe. Do you notice the tremor anywhere else besides your hand?
PATIENT: Elsewhere? Hmm… I don’t think so. Maybe a little in my leg sometimes, but that’s probably just restless legs or something. I always liked to fidget, even when I was a young man. It’s just… my hand is the worst of it. It makes things… difficult. Especially when I try to… hold a glass. Or sign something. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the hand, potentially some mild sensation in the leg. And it affects activities like holding a glass or signing your name. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What are you fishing for now? Look, I’m an old man. I ache. I get tired. I forget things. What does that have to do with my hand shaking? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming in here. It’s just a tremor! People get tremors.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I'm just trying to get a full picture, and sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms can be important. I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. Let me ask this, have you had any changes in your balance, any stiffness, or any difficulty with your speech?
PATIENT: Balance? No, I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk just fine, thank you very much. Stiffness… a little in my back, maybe? But that’s arthritis, plain and simple. And speech? What are you implying, I’m mumbling? I’m speaking perfectly clearly, as you can plainly hear! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: You're right, you are speaking perfectly clearly. And thank you for clarifying about your balance and the arthritis. I just want to be thorough. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, boy. Where do I begin? I’m 80 years old! I’ve got high blood pressure, I think. Or maybe it was my wife’s. I take a little pill for it, or something. And arthritis, as I said. I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… look, I don’t remember all of this! It was a long time ago. And frankly, it's not important. This is about the tremor, right? Can we just focus on that?
DOCTOR: Of course, we’ll focus on the tremor. Let me see what I have documented here... Yes, I see a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a cholecystectomy several years ago. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. And… something for my stomach, I guess. I don't even know what they are anymore! My daughter fills the prescriptions, she handles all of that. I just take what she gives me. I really don’t pay attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for arthritis and something for your stomach, managed by your daughter. It’s helpful that she assists with that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I used to love shellfish, even. No allergies. Honestly, this is taking forever. Are we getting anywhere with this tremor, or are we just going to keep asking questions? I’ve got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide. We’ve gathered a lot of useful information, and now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at the tremor and assess your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Look, I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind. I'm an old man! What good is a physical exam going to do? It's just a tremor, right? Can't you just give me something for it? A pill, maybe? I'm sure there's a pill for everything these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. A physical exam will help me rule out other potential causes and get a more accurate picture of what's going on. It’s quick, and I’ll be gentle. It will help me determine the best course of action, and whether a medication is appropriate. I'd like to check your reflexes, coordination, and muscle strength. It won't take long. If you're uncomfortable at any point, please let me know, and we can stop. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And be gentle, like you said. I don’t want any broken bones. This is ridiculous, you know. I came in for a tremor, not a full-body inspection. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your arms. Could you please extend both arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? See? They shake! This is what I've been trying to tell you the whole time. It's just a tremor. It's not like I'm paralyzed or anything. Now, can I sit down? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. It appears to be a resting tremor, primarily in your right hand, and it's present even when you're relaxed. I also notice a slight rigidity. Now, could you please tap your fingers together with each hand, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: There! See? It’s slower on this side. Like I said, it’s just a tremor. Everything’s slower on this side. It’s old age, I tell you. Everything’s falling apart. Can we be done now? I'm starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: I see. A slight slowing and decreased coordination in your right hand. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. I walked. Now, can I sit down again? This is getting ridiculous. I feel like I'm in a circus. Just tell me what's wrong with me, and give me a pill. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight shuffling gait. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it seems you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to order some further testing to confirm this. Specifically, I would like to order a DaTscan, which is a specialized imaging test that can help assess the function of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. I will also order blood work to rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s? What?! Oh, for goodness sake. My wife… she had something like that. It was… awful. Pills didn't do much good. And the shaking just got worse. You’re telling me I have that? I don’t want that. A scan? More tests? Look, I’m 80 years old! What’s the point? I don’t need any fancy scans. Just give me something for the tremor, and let me live out my remaining years in peace. I really don’t want to hear any more about this. This is… upsetting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. It is upsetting to hear something like that, and I apologize for the distress this is causing. I want to assure you that a diagnosis isn't a sentence. There are many treatments available that can help manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and improve your quality of life. The DaTscan will simply help us confirm whether or not your symptoms are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing cells. It's a non-invasive test, and it will give us valuable information to guide your treatment plan. I also want to emphasize that we don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet. It’s important to rule out other potential causes of your tremor before we make any conclusions. Would you be willing to consider the DaTscan and blood work?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But I don’t want any more tests after that. I'm too old for this nonsense. And I don't want to hear about… about what happened to my wife. Just… do the tests, and tell me what the results are. Quickly. And then give me something for the shaking. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. I’ll get the orders for the DaTscan and blood work scheduled for you right away. We’ll have the results back within a week or so, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I can prescribe a low dose of medication called Carbidopa-Levodopa to help manage your tremor. It’s the most commonly prescribed medication for Parkinson’s disease, and it can provide significant relief. However, it does have some potential side effects, so we’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Pills, scans, whatever. Just… get it done. I don’t want to sit around waiting and worrying. The sooner this is over, the better. And make sure your nurse explains those side effects properly. I don't want any surprises. Now, can I go home? I’m exhausted.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to explain the side effects of the Carbidopa-Levodopa and schedule the tests for you. She’ll also give you a written summary of our discussion and the medication instructions. Here's a summary of what we discussed today: You presented with a tremor, primarily in your right hand, that has been ongoing for an unknown duration. After a thorough history and physical exam, I suspect you may have Parkinson’s disease, but further testing is needed to confirm this. We’ve ordered a DaTscan and blood work. I’m prescribing Carbidopa-Levodopa to help manage your tremor in the meantime. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get me out of here. Honestly, this whole day has been a waste of time. Just… thank you. I guess. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. .
PATIENT: .
