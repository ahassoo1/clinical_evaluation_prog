DOCTOR: Hi Delron, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. It’s… well, the military. They want me to take a test, a check-up thing before I can… you know… join up. Said I needed a doctor to sign off on it. Seems like a lot of bother, honestly. I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A pre-enlistment physical. It is thorough, but definitely important. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, we want to make sure everything is as it should be and get a good baseline. It’s good you’re taking it seriously. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you’re joining up now?
PATIENT: Why now? Hmm. Well… things haven’t been… great, you know? The factory… it’s not what it used to be. And my boy, he’s always talking about… serving. Said it gives a man purpose. Frankly, I could use some purpose. And a steady paycheck wouldn’t hurt. It’s… practical.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Delron. It sounds like a thoughtful decision. Purpose and stability are important. Let’s focus on getting this physical done so we can move forward. To start, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve ever been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with? Not really. Had the usual childhood things. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. Broke my arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that healed up fine. Nothing the doctors ever… officially said was wrong with me. I’ve always been strong. Don't get sick easy.
DOCTOR: Good to know. That’s helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I told you, I don't get sick. No need for cutting people open. What kind of a question is that? You'd think they'd check this stuff before sending me all the way here.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Delron, to go through everything thoroughly. It ensures we have the most complete picture. I apologize if it feels redundant. Okay. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father, he had… problems with his breathing, later in life. Old age, mostly. He smoked too much. Mother… she was fine, mostly. A bit weak, maybe. But nothing… serious. Nothing anyone ever bothered with a doctor about, if you get my meaning. They were… practical people. Didn't complain much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so father with breathing problems related to smoking, mother with general weakness. That's good to know. And how about you currently?
PATIENT: Currently? I feel fine. Seriously. A bit tired maybe, everyone's tired these days. The work is hard. But no aches, no pains, no… problems. I eat alright, I sleep alright. I wouldn’t be here if something was wrong with me.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Delron. It's good you're so aware of your body. Just to be comprehensive, let's quickly run through a few systems. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Perfectly fine. Always been good. Can see further than most, I reckon. Read the paper every day. No trouble with that. What are you getting at? You think I'm blind or something?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Delron. I'm simply going through a standard checklist. It's important to rule everything out. How about your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing’s good. Always has been. Can hear my wife shouting from the other room, that's for sure. Though I don't always want to. It's good hearing, perfectly good. What is this, some kind of trick? You trying to find something wrong with me so I can't join up?
DOCTOR: Delron, I understand your frustration, and I assure you this is not a trick. I'm a doctor, and my job is to make sure you are healthy and fit for duty. The military requires a thorough assessment, and I'm just following protocol. It's in your best interest to be completely honest and let me do a quick exam. Let’s move on to your lungs and heart. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? What are those? Sounds… fancy. Look, I told you, I work hard. Sometimes I get winded, after lifting something heavy. But that's just… normal. A bit of sweat, a bit of ache. No pain, no… palpitations. I'm a strong man. You're wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Let's just listen to your heart and lungs, quickly. It won't take long, and it will give us a clearer picture. Please sit back and relax. Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but your rhythm is normal. I’m hearing a very slight wheeze in your lungs. Do you have a history of asthma, or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma? Allergies? Good heavens, no. I told you, I'm a strong man. I work with machines all day, grease, metal, dust… you think I'd be here if I had allergies? I get a bit of a cough sometimes, in the winter. But that's just… the cold. Everyone gets a cough in the winter. A wheeze? Never heard of it. You're making things up now.
DOCTOR: I'm not making anything up, Delron. A wheeze is a whistling sound when you breathe, and it can indicate some narrowing of the airways. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Doctors. Always looking for something wrong. Never heard of either one. I eat a normal diet, mostly. Meat and potatoes. Don’t bother with fancy salads or… whatever it is people eat these days. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I’m wasting my whole afternoon here, for nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delron. It sounds like you’re very proud of your health and strength, and that's wonderful. However, even strong people can have underlying conditions. It's my responsibility to make sure you're completely fit for duty, and that requires a thorough assessment. Let’s move on to your bowel and bladder habits. Have you noticed any changes in your stool or urination?
PATIENT: Now you're just being… personal. What does that even have to do with joining the military? I'm not discussing that with you. This is outrageous. I came here for a simple check-up, not a… an interrogation. I think I've had enough.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable, Delron. It’s standard medical procedure to ask about these things to get a complete picture of your health. I understand you're not comfortable discussing it, and we can skip that part. However, given your slightly elevated heart rate and the wheezing I heard, and the fact that you mentioned feeling tired, I would recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung condition. And a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I came here for a sign-off, not a battery of tests. You're trying to find something wrong with me. I'm perfectly healthy. I've told you that repeatedly. I don’t need X-rays, I don’t need blood panels, and I certainly don’t need a doctor trying to tell me what’s wrong with my body. I think I'm done here. Waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Delron, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, I have a professional obligation to advise you on what I believe is in your best interest. Without these tests, I cannot confidently sign off on your pre-enlistment physical. I would be happy to provide you with a written summary of my findings—the slightly elevated heart rate and mild wheezing—and explain why I believe further investigation is necessary. It's ultimately your choice, but I want to ensure you are fully informed. And, if you change your mind about the tests, please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Tests. Always tests. I've wasted enough time here. I'll… I'll figure it out myself. .
