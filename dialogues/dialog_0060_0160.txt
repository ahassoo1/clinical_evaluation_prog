DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's this… tiredness. It's just getting worse, and it's… embarrassing, really. And I've started… well, eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I don’t even like dirt! It just… tastes good sometimes. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we'll figure this out. "Tiredness getting worse," you said. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More? Honestly, what isn’t more? It’s just… constant. I sleep, and I’m still tired. I wake up tired. I try to do things around the house, and I have to sit down every five minutes. It’s been going on for months, maybe even longer, I just thought I was getting old, but now this dirt thing is happening and… it’s unsettling. I used to be so active. Now? Forget it. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this tiredness… does it interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfere? That's putting it mildly! I barely leave the house anymore. Used to love gardening, now I can't even bend over to pull a weed. I used to volunteer at the church, helping with the meals, but I just… stopped. Couldn't keep up. Even cooking is a struggle. I mostly just… exist, to be honest. And this eating… it happens when I'm really, really tired. Don't ask me why. It's shameful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's try to get a better picture of things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Well, my stomach has been a little… off. Not terrible, just… unsettled. And I get headaches, but I always get headaches. I’ve always had a weak constitution, I suppose. Oh! And my skin feels… dry. Really dry. Even with lotion. It’s like I’m turning into a lizard. And I’m always cold, even when it’s warm. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. This is probably a waste of your time.
DOCTOR: No, it's not a waste of my time, Ms. Hardenburgh. We need to rule things out. Now, about this stomach trouble – is it more nausea, pain, diarrhea, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not pain, exactly. More… just queasy. Like I might be sick, but I never am. And sometimes my bowels are a little… loose. Not terrible diarrhea, just… not firm. It comes and goes. It's probably just something I ate. I haven't changed my diet, though. I eat pretty much the same thing every day. Soup, mostly. And toast. And… well, whatever I can manage. I don't have a lot of energy for fancy cooking. This is all so silly. I’m probably just a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had the flu, of course, many times. And a bad case of shingles years ago. Oh, and I used to have terrible migraines when I was younger, but they mostly went away. The doctor gave me some pills for them, but I stopped taking them after a while. Made me feel… foggy. And I’ve had high blood pressure for a long time, but it’s usually under control with medication. I think. I just… take the pills they give me. I don't really pay attention to what they are. It’s all just a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you tell me what medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… There's a little white pill for my blood pressure, I think. And a multivitamin, because I heard it’s good for you. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. That’s it, I think. Oh! And I have some cream for my skin, but that’s not a pill. It’s… a tube. I keep them in a little box in the kitchen. Honestly, I don’t really remember what they’re for, I just take them when I need something. This is probably a complete waste of your time. I should just stay home and rest.
DOCTOR: It's not a waste of my time, Ms. Hardenburgh. We're getting there. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be very careful about what I ate, but now… what does it matter? I'm not getting any younger. Oh! I used to be allergic to dust, when I was a little girl, but I outgrew it. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve had an allergy in decades. This is silly. I should just go home and take a nap.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had… well, she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he died of old age, I suppose. He just wore out. And my sister… she had diabetes, I think. She lost a leg. It was very sad. And… well, that’s about all I remember. We didn’t really talk about medical things much. It wasn’t considered proper. Honestly, I doubt any of it matters. I'm just an old woman. This is a waste of your time. .
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of my time, Ms. Hardenburgh. We’re trying to put all the pieces together. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also check your abdomen and skin. Is that alright?
