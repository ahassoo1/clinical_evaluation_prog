DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter about some test results from a GI endoscopy I had done. The doctor who performed it said things didn’t look quite right, and I was advised to follow up with someone… and that led me here. I’m a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis. It's perfectly normal to feel that way when you’re waiting for answers. We'll get to the bottom of this together. So, you had a GI endoscopy recently, and the doctor recommended a follow-up. Do you happen to remember what specifically the doctor said didn’t look quite right, even if it was just a general impression?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Dr. Ramirez, the one who did the test, mentioned something about… inflammation, I believe. And a bit about the lining not looking smooth. He used words like “erythema,” but I confess, I don’t really understand all the medical terms. He said it wasn’t anything immediately alarming, but he wanted another opinion, just to be safe. He was very kind, but… I’m not a medical person, you see. I mostly work with my hands, metal and plastic, not… insides.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. You’re right to follow up, and that’s what I’m here for. “Erythema” just means redness, so inflammation and redness are consistent. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for the past few months, I’ve been having… discomfort. A sort of burning sensation in my stomach, mostly. And sometimes, a bit of nausea. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough to worry me. Then there were the… changes in my bowel habits. Not entirely unpleasant, but definitely… different from what I was used to. My late husband, God rest his soul, always said I should get it checked out, but I put it off. Old habits, you see. I try to be strong and handle things myself. But it got to the point where I couldn’t ignore it anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you finally came in to get it checked out. Burning sensation in the stomach, nausea, and changes in bowel habits… those are all things we need to investigate. When you say changes in bowel habits, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it’s a bit difficult to talk about, but I’ll try. For a long time, everything was… regular, if you understand. Then it became… looser. More frequent. And sometimes… darker in color. Not black, thankfully, but a very deep brown. And occasionally, I noticed… a bit of blood. Not a lot, just a few streaks. That’s what really frightened me, to be honest. That’s when I knew I couldn't wait any longer. I apologize for being so… graphic. It’s not a pleasant subject.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Denis. You’re providing me with important information, and it's my job to listen. It's very common for these things to be uncomfortable to discuss, and you're doing exactly the right thing by being open with me. So, looser stools, more frequent bowel movements, darker color, and some streaks of blood. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That does make me feel better. Hmm… let me think. I have been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And a bit of a loss of appetite. Not that I haven’t been eating, but I don’t feel as hungry as I used to. And occasionally… a feeling of fullness, even after only a small amount of food. It’s a strange sensation, like something is blocking me, if that makes sense. Oh! And I have been losing weight, a little bit at a time. Not a dramatic amount, but enough for my clothes to feel a bit looser. That’s about it, I believe. I hope I haven't forgotten anything. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You haven't forgotten anything important at all, Denis. Tiredness, loss of appetite, feeling of fullness, and some weight loss… all of these are things we need to consider. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had pneumonia when I was quite young, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that… I’ve always been quite healthy, for the most part. I’ve always tried to eat well and stay active, although my arthritis does slow me down a bit these days. I take medication for the arthritis, naproxen, I believe it’s called. And occasionally, something for the pain, when it gets really bad. Other than that… no, nothing serious. I haven’t had any surgeries or hospitalizations in many years. I’m not really one for doctors, you see. I prefer to avoid them if possible. But I’m glad I came to see you today.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. So, no major medical conditions, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, arthritis managed with naproxen, and occasional pain medication. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit harder, to be honest. My parents both passed away a long time ago. My mother died of… I believe it was heart disease, when I was still quite young. My father… he died in an accident. And I didn't know them very well, to be honest. They were… distant people. As for my siblings… I had one brother, but he emigrated to Argentina many years ago, and we lost touch. I haven't heard from him in decades. I don't know anything about his health, or the health of any other relatives, to be honest. I wish I did, but… I don't have much family history to share, I'm afraid. It’s a bit sad, really. I always regretted not keeping in touch with my brother. But… life happens, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. It’s common for people not to have much information about their family history. It sounds like you don’t have any known family history of gastrointestinal issues, which is helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My husband was a smoker, for many years, and I always hated it. It smelled dreadful, and it worried me terribly. I always made him smoke outside, and I encouraged him to quit, for years. He finally did, thankfully, just before he got sick. But no, I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, occasionally, but that’s about it. I’m not much of a drinker, to be honest. I prefer tea. And water. Lots of water. I believe it’s very important to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Denis. No smoking and very limited alcohol consumption are both positive. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the naproxen for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. Just the naproxen, and sometimes a pain reliever when the arthritis flares up. Oh! And I take a multivitamin, every morning. Just a general one, nothing special. And occasionally, some herbal tea for my sleep. Chamomile, mostly. It helps me relax. Other than that… no, that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many medications, if possible. I believe in natural remedies, when they work. But I understand that sometimes, medications are necessary. But no, just the naproxen, the multivitamin, and the chamomile tea. That’s it. I promise. I'm a very simple person, you see. Not much fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. So, naproxen, a multivitamin, and chamomile tea. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had any problems. I’ve never had a rash, or any difficulty breathing, or anything like that. I’ve never had any allergies, to my knowledge. My late husband was allergic to bee stings, but I wasn’t. No, I don’t have any allergies. I’m very lucky, in that regard, I suppose. It’s another thing I’m grateful for. But no, no allergies. I promise.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Denis. No known allergies. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently examine your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. My stomach has been a bit sensitive lately. But yes, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Another deep breath… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back, and relax. I’m noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Not a sharp pain, but definitely some discomfort when I press here. Your abdomen is also slightly distended, meaning it’s a little bit larger than usual. There’s no rebound tenderness, which is good. And I don’t feel any masses. Overall, your abdomen is tender, distended, and I hear some active bowel sounds. It doesn’t feel acutely surgical, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s where I’ve been feeling the discomfort. It’s not a constant pain, but it’s definitely there, especially after I eat. And yes, I have noticed my stomach feels… bloated, sometimes. Larger than usual. It’s a strange sensation, to be honest. I’m glad you noticed it too. I wasn’t sure if it was just my imagination. So… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I confess, I'm getting a bit anxious again. I understand you need to do more tests, but… could you give me a general idea of what might be causing this? Even just a possibility? I appreciate your honesty, whatever the answer may be.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis. It’s perfectly normal to be worried. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The tenderness, distention, and changes in your bowel habits, along with the weight loss and loss of appetite, could be indicative of a few different things. One possibility is a condition called diverticulitis, which is an inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. Another possibility is irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, although that typically doesn’t cause weight loss. And, given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out more serious conditions like colon cancer, although that's not to say that's what we're expecting. The endoscopy report you received is important here, and I’d like to review that carefully. It will give us more information about the lining of your colon. I will also order some blood tests to check for inflammation, anemia, and other markers. Depending on the results, we might need to consider a CT scan of your abdomen to get a more detailed picture. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis… IBS… colon cancer… Oh dear. That is a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I understand you need to consider all possibilities, but… colon cancer is a frightening thought. So, the blood tests and the CT scan… those will help you narrow down the possibilities? And the endoscopy report… you'll look at that too? I confess, I don’t understand all the medical terms. What exactly does the endoscopy report tell you? Is it just about the redness and inflammation? And… how long will it take to get the results of these tests? I know you're busy, and I don't want to rush you, but… I’m just anxious to know what’s going on. It’s hard to live with this uncertainty. I apologize for being so… demanding. I'm just a bit frightened, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re not being demanding at all, Denis. It's perfectly natural to be anxious and want answers. I'm happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. The endoscopy report provides a detailed look at the lining of your colon and stomach. It will tell us if there are any abnormalities, such as polyps, ulcers, or inflammation. The redness and inflammation we discussed are important, but the report will also look for more subtle changes. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and look for signs of infection or anemia, which can be a sign of bleeding in the colon. As for the CT scan, it provides a detailed image of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to see the colon and other organs in greater detail. It can help us identify any blockages, masses, or other abnormalities. Regarding the timeline, the blood tests usually take a few days to come back. The CT scan results typically take a bit longer, around a week. I will review all the results carefully and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. I’ll also call you if anything urgent comes up. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a bland diet, avoiding anything spicy or high in fiber, to help reduce the irritation in your colon. And I'll prescribe a mild stool softener to help with any constipation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, Doctor. A bland diet and a stool softener… I can do that. It’s good to have a plan, even if it’s just a temporary one. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better informed, and less anxious. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I know you’re very busy, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. So, just to be clear… you’ll call me if anything urgent comes up. And I should wait for your call before scheduling a follow-up appointment? I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. That's exactly right. I’ll call you immediately if anything urgent comes up with the test results. And please, do wait for my call before scheduling a follow-up appointment. I want to discuss everything with you in detail and answer any questions you may have. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Remember, we’re going to work through this together. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. For now, focus on resting and following the dietary recommendations. And try not to worry too much. Take care, Denis.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will do my best to rest and follow your recommendations. And I will try not to worry… although that may be easier said than done. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing that I’m in good hands. Goodbye, Doctor Sieh. And thank you again.
