DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It’s my ear, alright? It just…stopped working. On one side. And my face feels a little droopy on that same side. It happened yesterday morning. I woke up and…nothing. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time and experiencing some concerning symptoms. Ear stopping working and facial drooping – that is inconvenient, and we definitely want to figure out what's going on. Yesterday morning, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday morning. August 1st. Though honestly, dates aren't terribly important as long as we fix it. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. It’s not as if I have all day to sit around discussing the precise when of things. Is this something serious? Because I really need to know if I can still travel next week.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern about your travel plans, and getting to the bottom of this quickly is a priority. The timing is helpful, but your concern about the symptoms themselves is much more important. Facial drooping and sudden hearing loss can be signs of a few different things, some of which do need prompt attention. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me a little more about the drooping?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s subtle. Not like I'm completely paralyzed or anything. It’s… harder to smile on that side, I suppose. And when I try to raise my eyebrows, it doesn't go up as high. I noticed it when I was brushing my teeth. It’s quite irritating, really. I don’t do irritating. Is it…Bell’s palsy, or something? I read something about that once.
DOCTOR: Okay, harder to smile and raise your eyebrow on one side—that’s helpful. Bell's palsy is a possibility, definitely. It affects the nerves in the face, and can cause weakness or paralysis. However, there are other things it could be, so we need to do a bit more investigating. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s talk a little more about the ear. Did you have any pain with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Pain? No, absolutely not. No pain whatsoever. Just…silence. A very unwelcome silence, I might add. It’s like someone flipped a switch. And no dizziness or ringing, thankfully. It’s just…gone. And I haven’t been sick recently, if that matters. No colds, no flu, nothing. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you see.
DOCTOR: No pain, no dizziness, no ringing, and no recent illness – that's good information to have. A sudden onset of hearing loss without pain can point to a few different causes. Let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I'll just take a look in your ears, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. It won't take long. Could you look straight ahead for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this poking and prodding feels rather unnecessary, but fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Just…be quick about it. And try not to touch anything too forcefully. I have very sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal inside your ear. No obvious blockage or infection. Your reflexes are intact, but I do notice some slight weakness on the left side of your face—the same side as the hearing loss and drooping. It's subtle, as you mentioned. Do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very strict diet and exercise regime. I’m in excellent health. None of those…common ailments. My doctor always praises my vitals. And no family history of those things either, thankfully. We’re a very healthy lineage. Honestly, I suspect this is just a bizarre fluke. Though a very inconvenient one, I must say.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A healthy history definitely narrows things down. Given the sudden onset, the unilateral hearing loss, and the facial weakness, even with your excellent health history, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. While Bell’s palsy is still a possibility, we should also consider the possibility of a more serious issue, like a stroke, even though your other symptoms aren't typical. To be safe, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, that sounds rather… drastic. I had a perfectly good check-up last month! Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just try some…medication first? Perhaps some steroids? I’ve heard those can help with inflammation. I really don’t have time for extensive testing. I have a conference next week, you understand. A very important conference. And an MRI…that takes hours, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't think it was important. You're right, an MRI does take some time, usually about 30-60 minutes. However, it's the best way to rule out anything serious, like a stroke or a tumor, which could be causing your symptoms. Steroids can be helpful for Bell's palsy, but we need to know the cause of your symptoms before we start any treatment. Starting steroids without a diagnosis could mask a more serious problem. Given your busy schedule and the importance of your conference, it's even more important to get this figured out quickly. The MRI will give us the answers we need to make the right decision about treatment and ensure you're safe. We can usually get an appointment within 24-48 hours. What do you think?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is incredibly frustrating. Fine. An MRI, but you need to expedite it. And I expect a full report immediately. I do not have time to wait days for results. I need to know if I can travel. And if this is something serious, I expect you to be available for a consultation at your earliest convenience. This conference is non-negotiable. Can you guarantee a same-day report? Because if not, I may have to seek a second opinion. I don’t have time for delays.
DOCTOR: I understand your urgency, and I will absolutely do everything I can to expedite the MRI and get you the results as quickly as possible. I can arrange for the scan to be done this afternoon, and I will personally review the report as soon as it’s available. While a guarantee of same-day results is difficult – it depends on the radiologist’s workload – I will push for it and will call you immediately with any findings. I can also schedule a follow-up consultation for tomorrow morning, regardless of the results, to discuss the findings in detail and formulate a plan. We'll get this sorted out. I’ll have my assistant schedule the MRI and the follow-up appointment right away. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. That’s… acceptable. Get it done. Quickly. And make sure the technician understands I do not have time for unnecessary chatter. I prefer a professional environment. And…where do I go for this scan? And do I need to bring anything with me? Honestly, this is all rather inconvenient, but I suppose it’s necessary. Just…make it as painless as possible. And call me immediately. Immediately.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. My assistant, Sarah, will call you within the next hour with all the details – the address of the imaging center, what to expect during the scan, and any preparation instructions. You shouldn’t need to bring anything with you, but Sarah will confirm that. I’ve also made a note on your chart regarding your preference for a professional environment. And rest assured, I will call you personally as soon as I have the results. Here’s my direct line. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don’t worry. We’re doing everything we can to get you answers quickly. .
