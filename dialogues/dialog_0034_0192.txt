DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Yeah, well, the army... they want me to take a test. Some kinda exam before they even think about letting me join. Seems silly, but you gotta do what you gotta do, right? Figure I should get a check-up first, just in case. Don’t want to fail on some little thing.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Mr. Hartness. It’s always best to be thorough, and a pre-placement exam is quite standard. So, to clarify, you're here for a general check-up to fulfill requirements for joining the army. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or have any particular concerns you'd like to discuss while we’re at it?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Concerns? Not really. I mean, I work with engines all day. Hands get greasy, sometimes banged up. Back gets a little sore, you know? That's just life. Nothing a good night's sleep can't fix, usually. I’m a strong guy. Always have been. Don’t go getting any ideas about me being weak or somethin’. I just want to make sure I pass the test. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hartness. No ideas at all – you sound quite capable. It’s good you’re proactive about this. We'll do a comprehensive exam to ensure everything is in good working order for the army's requirements. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries... hmm. When I was a kid, maybe ten, fell outta a tree. Broke my arm, I think. Healed fine, never bothered me. Other than that... nothin’ serious. Maybe a few sprains playin’ football in school. Nothing that kept me down long. And illnesses… the usual childhood stuff, you know? Chickenpox, measles... Had the flu a couple times. But I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Not a sickly man, I can tell you that much. My wife, Ingrid, she handles all that stuff when she gets sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a child, some school sports injuries, and typical childhood illnesses. And it sounds like Ingrid takes good care of the family’s health. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. No need for 'em. I keep myself in good shape. Strong hands, strong body. Don’t go messing with things that aren’t broken, that’s my motto. Ingrid tried to get me to see about gettin’ my knees looked at a few years back, but I told her no. Waste of time and money, I said. She didn’t like that much, but she gets over it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Hartness. It's helpful to know your thoughts on that. Alright, moving on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a single one. I don’t believe in fillin’ my body with all that stuff unless absolutely necessary. A bit of coffee in the mornin’, that’s it. Ingrid sometimes tries to get me to take somethin’ for my back, but I tell her a hot bath does just fine. All those pills just seem like trouble, you know? Weakens you up.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for avoiding medication. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Not really. I mean, I don’t like bees, if that counts. Got stung when I was a kid, swelled up a bit. But I wouldn’t say I’m allergic. And food... I eat pretty much anything. Ingrid’s a good cook. Sometimes she makes somethin’ a little… fancy. But I’ll eat it. Don't go bein' picky, that's what I always say.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other major illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my father… he had a bad heart. Worked too hard, always stressed about somethin'. Died young, I reckon. Mother… she lived a long time, but her memory wasn't so good towards the end. Always forgettin' things. Ingrid's side... pretty healthy folks, mostly. Her father was a farmer, strong as an ox. Can't think of anythin' else really. They weren’t ones for talkin’ about illnesses much. Just dealt with ‘em.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Hartness. That gives me a good starting point. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. A lot. Engines don’t fix themselves, you know. I’m on my feet all day, hands busy. Come home, have dinner with Ingrid, watch a bit of television. Weekends, I do some work around the house, maybe help a friend with somethin’. I used to go fishin’ a lot more, but I just don't have the time these days. I don't smoke, never have. Drink a beer or two sometimes, with dinner. Nothing fancy. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonably active and straightforward lifestyle, Mr. Hartness. Finally, just to be completely thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Mental health… look, I work with my hands. I do things. I don't sit around worryin'. Sometimes I get frustrated with a stubborn engine, but that's not a condition, that's just life. Ingrid gets a little stressed sometimes, but she's a worrier by nature. Never been to see anyone about my head, if that’s what you mean. Strong mind, strong body. That's how I was raised.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for being so open with me. Alright, with that, I think we have a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and ensure you meet the requirements for joining the army. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know. Don’t want to be wastin' a whole day on this. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. If you could please step onto the table, we'll start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. We will also check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your height. Please stand up straight, looking forward. Okay… 187 centimeters. And now your weight… 53 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… ...15.1. That's below a healthy weight range. Now, if you could please remove your shirt, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Do you have any areas of pain or discomfort that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: What? 53 kilograms? That’s… ridiculous. I’m a strong man. Always have been. You gotta be messin' with somethin'. Ingrid will be furious if she hears this. No pain or discomfort. Just… thin. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I'm not making any errors. The scale is calibrated and functioning correctly. It's important to have accurate measurements for a proper assessment. I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. Your BMI being below 18.5 does indicate you are underweight, and that’s something we need to address. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Address? Address what? Look, I told you, I’m a strong man. I work hard every day! It's probably muscle. It's… denser muscle. Ingrid always says I’m built solid. She knows best. What’s the point of all this anyway? Is this gonna stop me from joining the army? That's all that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. And I appreciate you telling me about Ingrid’s assessment. However, a low BMI can indicate underlying health concerns, such as malnutrition or an eating disorder, even in someone who feels strong. We need to investigate this further to ensure you are physically fit for the demands of army service. Reflexes are normal. Ears appear clear. Throat is clear, no swelling or redness. I’m concerned about your weight. I recommend we run some blood tests to assess your overall health, including your nutrient levels and thyroid function. And I’d like to discuss your diet with you in more detail. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Diet? Look, I eat what Ingrid makes. She’s a good cook. And I don't have an eating problem. I just... don’t put on weight easily, okay? It’s a family thing. My mother was thin too. Always had to nag me to eat more when I was a kid. This is ridiculous. Are you trying to tell me I can't join the army because I’m a little skinny? Because that’s what it sounds like.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I'm not saying you can't join the army. I'm saying we need to rule out any underlying medical issues that could affect your health and performance. The army has strict physical requirements for a reason, and it's my responsibility to ensure you meet those requirements safely. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health, including your nutrient levels, thyroid function, and any potential vitamin deficiencies. And discussing your diet with you will help me understand your eating habits and identify any areas where you might be lacking essential nutrients. Would you be willing to schedule those tests today?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do your tests. But don’t go makin’ a big deal outta nothin’. I'm fine. Ingrid will be furious if you tell her I was here complaining about bein’ too skinny. Just… get it over with. And make it quick. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hartness. I’ll respect your privacy. I will not discuss your concerns with anyone without your explicit permission. Alright. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. The lab is just down the hall. You can go there now, and they'll draw the samples. It should take about 30 minutes. Here's the form. Please take this to the lab technician. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to incorporate more nutrient-rich foods into your diet. And if you have any concerns or experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get this over with. Ingrid's gonna kill me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. You take care. And remember, if you have any concerns at all, please don't hesitate to call.
