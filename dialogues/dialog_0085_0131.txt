DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure lately. It’s been a bit high, and my regular doctor thought it would be best to get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. It’s always wise to get things checked out. High blood pressure is something we want to take seriously. First, let’s talk a little more about this. When did you first notice your blood pressure being higher than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably around… March, I guess? Maybe April. It was after I started helping my aunt with her garden. Lots of bending and lifting, you know? I just figured it was from that at first, but it hasn’t really gone down even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around March or April, coinciding with starting to help your aunt with gardening. And it's remained elevated even at rest. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about how you know your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Well, my neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, she has one of those machines. She lets me use it sometimes. She’s a retired nurse, you see. She said it was getting a little high a couple of times when I checked it with her machine. And then I went to the pharmacy, just to be sure, and they did a quick check and said the same thing. I don’t have one myself, just borrowing hers and using the one at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had a couple of readings from a neighbor’s machine and at the pharmacy that indicated elevated blood pressure. That’s good that you’re being proactive. Do you happen to know what those numbers were, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… numbers aren’t my strong suit. I think Mrs. Thompson said it was something like… 140 over… 90? Or maybe 95? I honestly don’t remember exactly. And the pharmacy lady just said it was a little high, she didn't give me specific numbers. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful with that.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mykeisha. It’s perfectly fine – numbers can be confusing. 140/90 is a good starting point to know. Let’s get a reading here in the office just to be certain, and then we can talk about what that means. Would you mind if we took your blood pressure now?
PATIENT: Not at all, go right ahead. I’m happy to get it checked properly here. Hopefully, it's not too bad!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. And your pulse is 78. That’s a bit elevated, as you suspected. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with the higher blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… not really anything major. Sometimes I get a little bit of a headache, especially in the back of my neck. And I feel a bit tired, but honestly, who doesn’t feel tired these days? Nothing I’d really point to as being because of the blood pressure, if that makes sense. No dizziness or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Headaches and fatigue can be caused by many things, so it's good to know you're not experiencing anything more concerning like dizziness. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, I think. My regular doctor always says my check-ups are good. I did have a bit of trouble with my knees a few years ago, but that's about it. Just a little arthritis, nothing serious. I don't take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No prior diagnoses and no medications. And the arthritis in your knees… is that something that causes you much pain or limits your activities?
PATIENT: It’s mostly just a little stiff in the mornings, or if the weather is bad. I can still get around just fine, thankfully. I try to keep moving, you know? Staying active helps. It doesn't stop me from gardening with my aunt, anyway!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear – staying active is excellent. Now, do you have a family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had high blood pressure. He was on medication for it for years. And my aunt, the one I help with the garden, she has it too, and she's been taking pills for it for a while now. So yeah, it runs in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure on both sides of your family. That certainly makes it even more important to address this. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work part-time at a senior center, mostly helping with activities and meals. It’s pretty low-stress, which I like. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. I try to eat healthy, but I do like a good sweet treat now and then! I walk a lot, especially when I'm gardening or going to see my friend.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Part-time work, no smoking, limited alcohol, attempts at a healthy diet, and regular walking. That's a good foundation. And just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've never really had to worry about allergies, which I'm grateful for! I don't have any trouble with food allergies either, I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mykeisha, that gives me a good overview. Given your elevated blood pressure readings, your family history, and your lifestyle, it looks like we’re dealing with what we call Stage 1 Hypertension. Now, let’s talk about what that means and what we can do about it. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Stage 1… Hypertension? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Honestly, I'm a little worried now. What does that mean exactly? And what kind of things can we do about it? I’d really appreciate it if you could explain it to me in plain English, if you don’t mind. I don't want to get too overwhelmed with medical terms.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's good you're asking questions, and I want to make sure you understand everything. Stage 1 Hypertension simply means your blood pressure is a little higher than normal, but not dangerously high. Think of it like a warning light on your car – it's telling you something needs attention, but you're not broken down on the side of the road yet. Your blood pressure is consistently above 130/80, and yours is currently around 148/92. Now, high blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels over time, which can lead to problems like heart disease, stroke, and kidney issues. But the good news is, it's often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. We’ll start with lifestyle modifications first, since you’re already doing some good things. That includes things like continuing to eat a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, managing stress, and limiting alcohol. We can also discuss a low-sodium diet. Would you like me to explain what that entails?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. A warning light… I like that analogy. It's good to know it's not an emergency, but it’s something I need to take seriously. And I'm happy to try lifestyle changes first. That sounds a lot better than medication, to be honest. Yes, please, could you explain what a low-sodium diet is? I know I probably eat too much salt, I do like to cook, and I use it a lot for flavour. What kind of things would I need to cut back on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A low-sodium diet simply means reducing the amount of salt in your food. It's one of the most effective ways to lower blood pressure. The goal is to aim for less than 2300 milligrams of sodium per day, and ideally, even lower – around 1500 milligrams. Now, the biggest sources of sodium aren't usually the salt shaker on your table, but hidden sodium in processed foods, canned goods, and restaurant meals. Things like canned soups, processed meats , frozen dinners, and fast food are very high in sodium. Restaurant meals can also be surprisingly salty. To reduce your sodium intake, you can try a few things. Read food labels carefully and choose low-sodium options. Cook more meals at home using fresh ingredients. Use herbs, spices, and lemon juice to flavour your food instead of salt. Rinse canned goods before using them. And be mindful of portion sizes – even healthy foods can contribute to your sodium intake if you eat too much. Would you like me to provide you with a handout that lists low-sodium food choices and recipes?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, thank you! I had no idea processed foods had so much salt in them. I do eat a lot of canned beans and stuff, I thought they were pretty healthy. And you’re right about restaurant meals… I do like to go out with my friend sometimes. A handout would be really helpful, so I can remember everything you've told me. It's a lot to take in! And maybe some ideas for flavouring food without using salt, too? I do like to cook, so I’d want to make sure things still taste good.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you are. This handout includes a list of low-sodium food choices, tips for reducing sodium intake, and some recipes. It also has a section on using herbs and spices to flavour your food without salt. Some good options include garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, basil, and rosemary. Lemon juice and vinegar can also add flavour without the sodium. Now, we'll want to monitor your blood pressure regularly to see how these changes are working. I’d like you to check your blood pressure at home, if possible. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. If you’re unable to get one, you can come back to the clinic in two weeks for a follow-up appointment, and we’ll check it here. Do you have any questions about how to check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: That's perfect, thank you so much! This is really helpful. I think I might get one of those home monitors, that seems like a good idea, so I can keep track of things. And yes, actually, I do have a question about that. How often should I be checking it? And what numbers should I be looking for? Should I be worried if it’s a little high one day, and then lower the next? I don't want to get too stressed out about it!
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's smart to think about managing stress! Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. If you get a home monitor, I’d like you to check your blood pressure at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you eat or take any medication. Sit quietly for five minutes before taking the reading, and take two readings, one minute apart, and record the average. Ideally, your blood pressure should be below 130/80. It’s normal for your blood pressure to fluctuate throughout the day, so a slightly elevated reading one day doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be worried. However, if your blood pressure consistently stays above 140/90, you should contact me. We can then discuss adjusting your lifestyle changes or considering medication. Also, it's important to remember that a single reading isn't necessarily representative of your overall blood pressure. I’ll look at the trends over time, not just one isolated number. Do you feel comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Checking it at the same time each day and looking at the trends over time… that sounds much less stressful. And knowing that a single high reading isn't an emergency is really reassuring. Okay, I think I can manage that. I’ll get a home monitor and start checking my blood pressure tomorrow. And I'll try to be mindful of the sodium in my food and use more herbs and spices. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and I feel much better about this now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, managing your blood pressure is a team effort, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. So, to recap, we’re starting with lifestyle modifications – reducing sodium intake, increasing flavour with herbs and spices, and monitoring your blood pressure at home. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Two weeks is good. I'll do my best to stick to the plan. And thank you again for being so patient and helpful. I really appreciate it. I think I’ll go get that monitor now! Have a good day, Dr. Lahn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. You have a good day too, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I'm confident you can manage this.
