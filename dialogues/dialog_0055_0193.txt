DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having… a lot of gas. More gas than usual, you understand. It’s been happening for, oh, maybe a month now? I just thought I would get it checked.
DOCTOR: Gas, you say. A month, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It’s not painful, exactly, but… disruptive. And sometimes a little smelly, if I’m being completely honest. It happens… after I eat, mostly. But sometimes even when I haven’t eaten anything for a while. It's just... a lot. I worry it might be something more serious, even though it doesn’t feel serious.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Disruptive gas for a month. And it occurs… irrespective of food intake, at times?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Not always after eating, no. Sometimes it just… happens. I eat a pretty normal diet, I think. Nothing too fancy. Sandwiches, soups, things like that. I don't drink a lot of soda, and I only have coffee with breakfast. I don't smoke. I did have a bit of a cold last month, but I’m all better now. Could that have something to do with it, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A cold last month… interesting. And you describe a ‘normal’ diet. Could you elaborate on a typical day’s intake for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… Usually, for breakfast, I have a cup of coffee with a small piece of toast. For lunch, it’s often a sandwich – maybe ham and cheese, or tuna. Sometimes I’ll have a soup instead, if it’s cold outside. And then for dinner… well, it varies. Sometimes pasta, sometimes chicken with vegetables. I try to have something with a bit of protein. I don’t eat a huge amount, if that makes sense. I’m not a big eater. And I always have a glass of water with my meals. Oh! And a small piece of fruit, usually an apple or an orange, for a snack.
DOCTOR: So, a rather… unremarkable diet. And no recent changes to it?
PATIENT: No, no changes at all. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things for… well, for years, I suppose. Nothing new has been added, and I haven’t cut anything out. I haven’t traveled anywhere, either. Everything is just… normal. It's just this gas that’s not normal. I feel a bit silly even talking about it, to be honest. It’s not a dignified complaint, is it?
DOCTOR: Dignity is… relative, Mr. Goodstein. However, we must rule out more serious etiologies. Now, do you experience any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits alongside this… flatulence?
PATIENT: Well, no pain, no. And I wouldn’t say bloating, exactly. Maybe a little fullness after a big meal, but nothing unusual. No nausea either. As for bowel habits… they’re… regular, I think. Not faster, not slower. Same as always, if that makes sense. It’s all just… gas. A lot of it. And sometimes a bit… unpleasant smelling. I apologize for being so graphic, Doctor. I just want to explain everything clearly.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Detailed information is… useful. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no blood at all. Absolutely none. Everything looks… normal in that regard. Truly. I… I check, you understand, just to be sure. It’s just the gas, and the… occasional odour. And the disruption it causes. It’s a bit embarrassing when I’m out, if you catch my drift. I worry it might offend someone. It's a silly worry, I suppose, but… it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Goodstein, given your… unremarkable medical history and your description of the symptoms, it is likely this is a functional gastrointestinal issue. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. Or, I used to eat everything without a problem. Now, I'm starting to think twice before I have a bean burrito, if you understand. Just in case. But no, no known allergies. I have never been told I am allergic to anything, and I've never had any hives or swelling or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. I try to avoid medication if I can. Just a bit of cough syrup when I have a cold, and that's it. I don't have any ongoing medical problems that require regular treatment, thankfully. I’m generally a healthy person, I believe. It’s just… this gas. It’s very unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No medications. Very well. I will perform a brief physical examination to rule out any obvious abnormalities. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. And please don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels… unpleasant. I apologize for the repetition, but I would prefer to be clear.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. I will listen to your abdomen, and then palpate it gently. Please relax. Normal bowel sounds present in all four quadrants. No bruits noted. Soft abdomen, non-tender to palpation. No masses appreciated. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. No acute findings on abdominal examination.
PATIENT: That… that wasn’t unpleasant at all, Doctor. Just a bit… strange, perhaps. I’m glad to hear there wasn’t anything… concerning. It's reassuring. I was starting to worry it might be something serious. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Based on the examination, there are no immediate concerns. As I mentioned previously, it is likely a functional gastrointestinal issue. This can be due to various factors, often related to diet or stress. We could perform some tests to rule out other possibilities, such as lactose intolerance or H. pylori infection, but given your history and the benign nature of the examination, I do not believe it is immediately necessary. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, we can certainly consider further investigation. Do you have any questions about this, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Functional… so it’s not something… bad? Just something that happens? I suppose that’s… good. Tests… no, I don't think I want any tests if you don’t think they’re necessary. I’d rather avoid them, if I can. I’m a bit… squeamish, you understand. So, what can I do? Is there anything I can eat or not eat? Anything I can do to… reduce the gas? Or anything to stop it from being so… potent, perhaps? And is there anything I can do to prevent it from happening when I’m out? It's the social aspect that bothers me the most, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Quite. Avoidance of known gas-producing foods may be helpful. These include beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated beverages. Eating slowly and thoroughly chewing your food can also minimize gas production. Over-the-counter remedies such as simethicone or activated charcoal may provide some relief, but their efficacy is limited. As for preventing it in social situations… it’s difficult to guarantee. However, being mindful of your diet prior to social engagements and avoiding known triggers can reduce the risk. Small portions are often better tolerated. There are no pharmacological interventions I would recommend at this time. If the symptoms continue to be problematic, a consultation with a gastroenterologist may be considered. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Beans… broccoli… yes, I do eat those sometimes. I’ll try to avoid them, then. And I’ll be more mindful of my chewing, certainly. Small portions… that’s a good idea. Perhaps I’ll just avoid them altogether before I go out. Simethicone… I think I’ve heard of that. I’ll look into it. A gastroenterologist… no, let's not do that yet. Let’s try these things first. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. You’ve been very helpful. It’s reassuring to know it’s not something serious. I appreciate your patience. And your… discretion. It was a bit embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You are quite welcome, Mr. Goodstein. As I said, it is likely a functional issue. I will document our findings and recommendations. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if your symptoms worsen or do not improve. I trust you will find some relief with these simple measures. Have a pleasant day. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. I believe I’m all set. Thank you again for your time and your… understanding. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Eaddy. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Goodstein. .
