DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re 66 years old. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, frankly, I don’t have time for this. Something is… not right. My vision, it’s gone blurry, and the hearing… it’s fading. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie, and I'll do my best to be efficient. It sounds concerning that you’re experiencing changes in both your vision and hearing. To get a better understanding of what’s happening, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I couldn't tell you precisely. It wasn’t a sudden thing. More… gradual. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to pinpoint. Things just… aren’t as sharp as they used to be. And people seem to be mumbling more lately, or perhaps they always did. I really don't know. I just noticed it. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Julie. A gradual onset is important information. And it’s common to not be able to pinpoint the exact moment these things start. Let's try to be a little more specific. With your vision – is it blurry all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Mostly all the time. Though, sometimes it seems… worse than others. Like when I’m reading. Or driving, which is… unpleasant. Though I rarely drive anymore. It’s just… a general haziness, doctor. It’s rather distressing. Are we getting somewhere with this, or are you simply trying to delay the inevitable?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem slow, Ms. Julie. I want to be thorough. It is important to understand the nature of the haziness. Does it affect your peripheral vision at all – so, things to the sides when you’re looking straight ahead?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision? Doctor, I am a surgeon. I examine vision, I don’t… analyze it in terms of “peripheral.” Honestly. But… now that you mention it, yes. It’s… diminished, I suppose. Everything feels a bit… tunnel-like. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Julie. That detail – the tunnel-like vision – is very important. And I apologize for asking what may seem like basic questions; it helps me build a complete picture. Now, regarding your hearing... is the fading consistent, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate, I suppose. Some days it’s… manageable. Others, I can barely hear a thing. It’s quite embarrassing, really. I had a lunch with some colleagues last week, and I simply couldn't follow the conversation. They were looking at me like I was the problem. Honestly, I’ve always had excellent hearing. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie, and I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life. To get a better sense of the overall picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, are you suggesting I'm falling apart? I am a perfectly healthy woman. But… now that you ask, I have been feeling… rather fatigued lately. And a bit… lightheaded, perhaps. Though, I attribute that to the stress of this entire situation, frankly. And the heat. It’s been terribly hot. Are we still gathering information? This is taking a very long time.
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the pace, Ms. Julie. I assure you, I'm trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what's going on. Fatigue and lightheadedness are important to note, and it's good you've shared that. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, do I look like the sort of person who readily shares their medical history? Very well. I had a rather… difficult divorce some years ago. The stress of it caused some… digestive issues. And I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. Beyond that… I’ve been remarkably healthy, thank you very much. Are we almost finished? I have a charity gala this evening, you know. A very important one.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie. Thank you for sharing that information. Digestive issues and gallbladder removal are helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Really, doctor? Must we rehash every single detail of my life? No. Just the gallbladder. And a rather minor procedure on my knee when I was younger – a sports injury. Honestly, I was quite active in my youth. But that was… decades ago. Is there a point to all these questions, or are we simply cataloging my entire existence?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the repetition, Ms. Julie. It's standard practice to gather a complete history to ensure nothing is overlooked. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, vision or hearing loss, for example?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the unpleasantness. My mother… she had some sort of… heart trouble. And my uncle, on my father's side, had diabetes. It was a rather messy affair. And my grandmother… she went deaf, eventually. A very sad situation. Honestly, doctor, it's all quite depressing. Must we dwell on such morbid topics? I have a life, you know. A very busy one. Are we finally nearing the end of this interrogation?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Julie. It’s not pleasant to revisit difficult family history, and I appreciate you sharing this information. Now, just a few more questions, and then we’ll move on to a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you currently take any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I pride myself on maintaining excellent health through a balanced diet and regular exercise. I do not rely on pharmaceuticals. Though… I occasionally take an antacid. For the… indigestion. But that’s it. And a multivitamin, of course. Is that sufficient? Can we please get on with this? I have a luncheon appointment in an hour, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. So just the antacid and a multivitamin. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I am a very robust individual. Though… I do have a slight sensitivity to shellfish. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I simply avoid it. Are we absolutely finished now? I must confess, this entire process has been rather… draining. I’m quite certain I’ve answered enough questions to fill a medical textbook. Let us proceed with whatever examination you deem necessary. And please, be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your vision. Could you please stand about ten feet away and read the smallest line you can see on the chart?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I knew this was coming. Very well. Let’s get this over with. “E… P… T… F… L… 20/… what is it? 20/40, perhaps? It’s all terribly blurry, you know. As I’ve already explained. Multiple times.”
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. You're correct, your vision is approximately 20/40 in both eyes. That indicates some degree of visual impairment. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. Can you tell me when you first notice my hands coming into your vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, this is rather… unnerving. I feel like I’m being ambushed. “Now. I see them… just now. On both sides. They’re quite… vague. Are you attempting to trick me? Honestly, I’m a very perceptive woman.”
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Julie, I’m not attempting to trick you. Your peripheral vision appears somewhat limited. Now, let's move on to your hearing. I’m going to gently examine your ears with this instrument. It doesn’t hurt. Your ear canals appear clear. Now, I'm going to perform a simple hearing test. I’ll play tones at different pitches and volumes, and I’d like you to indicate when you can hear them. Please raise your hand when you hear a tone.
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, this is quite… undignified. And the tones are terribly irritating. “There. Now. That one. And… now that one. They’re all rather… faint. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when I hear them, you know. I’m a woman of discernment, not a laboratory rat.”
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. Based on the initial hearing test, there is some degree of hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies. Finally, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/85, and your pulse is 72. Everything seems within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the examination, it appears you’re experiencing some degree of vision and hearing loss. The fatigue and lightheadedness could be related, or could be due to other factors. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we should monitor. I’m going to order some additional tests. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions, a thyroid panel to assess your thyroid function, and a referral to an ophthalmologist and an audiologist for more comprehensive evaluations. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, doctor, this is precisely what I was afraid of. I had hoped to simply receive a diagnosis and a quick remedy. But, very well. If it must be done. An ophthalmologist and an audiologist, you say? I suppose I have no choice. But please, expedite the process. My schedule is exceedingly demanding, you know. And make sure they are highly reputable. I do not have time for incompetence. I trust you are handling this with the utmost discretion? I certainly do not wish to be the subject of gossip. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results, in terms I can understand. No medical jargon, please. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Julie. I will expedite the process and ensure you receive appointments with highly reputable specialists. I will personally follow up to ensure a smooth experience. I am now issuing the orders for the blood work and the specialist referrals. The lab results should be available within 48-72 hours, and I will contact you immediately with the findings. I’ll also send the referral information to your email and fax it to the specialists directly to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting adequate rest. If you experience any sudden changes in vision or hearing, or if you develop a severe headache, please contact me immediately. I also want to gently suggest monitoring your blood pressure at home. I can arrange for you to borrow a blood pressure cuff, or you can purchase one at most pharmacies. Keeping a log of your readings will be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Blood pressure at home? Honestly, doctor, are you suggesting I become a medical technician? I haven't the time for such things. And no, I do not have any questions. I expect you to handle this efficiently and discreetly. And please, do not inundate me with unnecessary information. I simply want a diagnosis and a solution. Very well. I suppose I should be going. I have a luncheon appointment, you know. I trust you will be in touch promptly. Good day. .
