DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tasmia. Welcome in. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure…right. The nurse mentioned something about a reading taken on the phone, yes. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out, even if you feel fine, because high blood pressure often doesn’t have symptoms, and it's important to manage. Could you tell me a little more about when you first found out about it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. Some phone call, a few weeks ago maybe? They said my numbers were “too high.” I just… I don’t get why I have to come in for this. I have things to do, you know? It’s a waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia, and I truly apologize for any inconvenience this is causing. It is good you have things going on, and that means you're healthy and active – which is great! But high blood pressure, if left unchecked, can lead to more serious problems down the road. We want to prevent that. Let’s try to piece things together a little. Do you happen to remember who called you?
PATIENT: It was… the hospital, I think? Not my regular doctor's office. Some lady with a fast voice. She kept saying stuff about a “screening” and numbers. I mostly just wanted her to get off the phone. Honestly, I probably should've just hung up. I don't trust people calling me out of the blue.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. A lot of folks feel that way about unexpected phone calls. It sounds like it may have been a follow-up from a recent health screening event. We sometimes partner with the hospital for those. Okay. Well, we'll get your blood pressure checked here today to confirm everything. To help me get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your health history?
PATIENT: Ugh, history? I don't even know where to start. I mean, I haven't been sick sick, ever. I work outside, a lot. Building stuff. It keeps me busy. My mom had… something with her heart, I think? When she got older. That’s about all I know. She didn’t really talk about it. I don't really ask.
DOCTOR: That's okay, we’ll take it slow. Working outside is good, staying active is excellent. And it's good you mentioned your mom – we'll get a little more detail on that in a bit, if you're comfortable. Let's start with you. Any major illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Broken a bone once, when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious. I eat okay, I guess. Not a lot of junk food. Mostly just… normal stuff. I don't drink a lot of soda. Maybe one a week.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That’s helpful. And do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. My grandma smoked, and it smelled awful. Ruined everything. I wouldn’t touch that stuff. It’s disgusting.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. Not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, with all the pollen. But that’s it. Nothing I take medicine for. It's just… spring. Everyone gets sniffly in the spring. It’s annoying, is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal allergies. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single thing. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel weird. And I don’t need any. I’m perfectly healthy, mostly. This whole blood pressure thing is just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. We'll work with that. Now, just to be thorough, let's get some basic measurements. I’m going to check your height and weight, then we’ll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do, remember? And don’t tell me about all the things that could go wrong. I don’t need a lecture. Just tell me if something’s actually wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tasmia. Just the facts, as you wish. Let's get started then. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Here. Just hurry up. I feel ridiculous standing here.
DOCTOR: Alright, height is 184 centimeters, and weight is 104 kilograms. That gives us a BMI of… 30.7. That places you in the overweight category, Tasmia. Now, if you’ll have a seat here, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll check your blood pressure. I’ll need you to remove your jacket for that.
PATIENT: Overweight? Seriously? I’m a builder. I’m muscle. Not fat. This is a waste of time. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. Just get on with it. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Now, we’ll just take your blood pressure. Try to relax your arm. First reading is 152 over 98. Second reading is 155 over 101. Those readings are elevated, Tasmia. Significantly so. Your blood pressure is currently considered Stage 2 hypertension. That's why the nurse called, and why it's important we discuss this further.
PATIENT: Hypertension? What does that even mean? I feel fine! I’m telling you, something is wrong with your machine! It’s probably broken. Builders don't get hypertension. We lift things! It’s good for you!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. It is possible for the machine to be slightly off, so I’ll double-check it. But even if it’s a bit high, these readings are still concerning. Hypertension simply means high blood pressure. It doesn’t necessarily feel like anything, which is why it’s often called the “silent killer.” It puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels, and over time, that can lead to serious problems like heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. Okay, just checking the other arm. 153 over 99. Consistent readings. Now, let’s talk about what could be causing this. Sometimes, it’s just genetics – runs in the family. Other times, it’s related to lifestyle factors like diet and stress. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Like I said, my mom had something with her heart when she got older. But she didn't tell me what. And stress? I’m a builder! It’s a stressful job, yes, but everyone’s job is stressful! I don’t need a lecture about stress. I just want to know if I can go home now, or if I’m stuck here all day getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems, but limited details. That’s helpful to know. Well, we're not done yet, but we can definitely discuss a plan. Just getting poked and prodded isn’t the goal. We need to figure out why your blood pressure is elevated, and how to get it under control. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other things that can contribute to high blood pressure. We should also do an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Can’t you just tell me to eat less salt or something? I don't want needles. I hate needles. And I don’t have time for all this. I have a job to do. I still think your machine is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Tasmia. Eating less salt is a good start, and we’ll definitely talk about lifestyle changes. But it's important to rule out other potential causes for your high blood pressure before we jump to conclusions. The tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. And I assure you, the blood tests are relatively quick and painless. It’s just a small needle prick, and it doesn’t take long. Look, I’m not trying to scare you, or waste your time. I’m just trying to be thorough, and make sure you’re healthy. Untreated high blood pressure can have serious consequences. If we can identify the cause, we can develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. That might include medication, lifestyle changes, or both. Would you be willing to consider the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But I want it to be quick. And I want the results fast. I don’t want to keep coming back here. And don’t tell me about all the scary things that could happen. Just tell me what I need to do, and let me get out of here. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tasmia. We'll make it as quick as possible. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and EKG right now. The lab and EKG technician are just down the hall, so it shouldn’t take long. We typically get the results back within a few business days, and we'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. I also suggest cutting back on salt intake and eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss your options in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And don't bother calling me with a bunch of scary news. Just tell me what I need to do. I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tasmia. I understand. The lab is just through that door, and the technician is expecting you. I’ll get the orders sent over right now. And don't worry, I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. I'll call with the results and we'll discuss a plan together. Have a good afternoon, and I'll be in touch soon.
