DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jailenne. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Renzi, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting chills, and it’s a bit worrying. It’s not like a cold chill, you know? It just…happens.
DOCTOR: Hmm, chills that just… happen. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s hard to explain… it’s not constant. Like, it doesn’t happen all the time. Maybe a few times a day? And it’s not always the same. Sometimes it’s just a little shiver, other times I feel really cold, like I need a blanket even though it’s warm in here. It doesn’t seem to be connected to being cold, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jailenne. That's helpful. So, these chills come and go, a few times a day, varying in intensity… and they aren’t related to the temperature around you. Do they happen at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I haven’t really noticed a pattern, to be honest. Sometimes it’s when I’m just sitting, other times when I’m walking around. I guess… maybe a little more when I’m stressed? But I live with a bit of stress, so it's hard to say for sure. It's not like every time I'm stressed, I get them, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, so not consistently linked to stress, but perhaps a bit more frequent when you’re feeling stressed. Okay. And aside from the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no cough, no sore throat. I haven't been feeling sick, just… chilly. Maybe a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t tired? I work a lot. It's probably just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other accompanying symptoms like fever, cough, or sore throat. Just the chills and some fatigue. That's good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Nothing major, really. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, but that was ages ago. I don’t have any ongoing health conditions, like diabetes or anything. I had pretty regular check-ups with my old doctor, but I moved here a few months ago and haven’t found a permanent one yet. I’m generally pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well and exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history, just childhood chickenpox and a broken arm. No chronic conditions, and you generally consider yourself healthy. And you've had regular check-ups in the past. Good. Any surgeries, Jailenne?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm, and that was just a cast. Nothing inside, if that makes sense. It’s probably nothing serious, right? I just don’t want it to be something awful.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like anything awful at this point, Jailenne. But we want to rule things out, of course. And it's always good to get these things checked. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. My mum’s side, not really. She was pretty healthy all her life, but she passed away a few years ago. My dad… he has high blood pressure, I think. And his brother had some heart problems, but he was a smoker for years. Nothing major on either side that I know of, though. It’s not like anyone had, you know, anything contagious or something. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Jailenne. High blood pressure in your father and heart problems in his brother, but nothing else significant that you’re aware of. Okay. And just to finish up the history part, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I’m pretty busy. I live alone. I used to be married, but we divorced a few years ago. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, like at parties or special occasions. I try to eat healthy, like I said, and I go to the gym when I can. It’s hard to find the time, though. I don’t really have any major hobbies, just… trying to keep up with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a health education specialist, live alone, divorced, don’t smoke, drink socially, and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That's good to know. Now, just one last question about your history before we move on to a quick exam: do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any problems with medications either. I used to worry about it, but I've never had an allergic reaction. I think I'm pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Alright, Jailenne, this is all very helpful information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfect. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Now, let's check your temperature. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Finally, I'm going to check your pulse. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Alright, everything seems normal so far. Do you have any areas of pain or discomfort that I should be aware of before I finish?
PATIENT: No, nothing really. Maybe… sometimes a little bit of a headache, but it's not constant. It's usually just a mild ache, nothing serious. And it doesn't feel connected to the chills, if that makes sense. It’s probably just stress, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional mild headaches, but not related to the chills. Alright, Jailenne, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, everything seems within normal limits. However, these unexplained chills are something we should investigate further to rule out any underlying causes. It could be a number of things, from a mild viral infection to something else. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If it helps figure things out, definitely. Blood work is fine. Will I need a referral or anything?
DOCTOR: No, not at this stage, Jailenne. We'll start with the blood work. If the results come back abnormal, or if your symptoms worsen, then we can discuss further testing or a referral to a specialist. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. I'll have the results sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe fatigue, or any other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. 24-48 hours, and they’ll call me to schedule a follow-up. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. Thank you, Dr. Renzi.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for listening and taking it seriously. I feel a lot better knowing we're looking into it. I'll wait for the call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Remember, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, Jailenne.
