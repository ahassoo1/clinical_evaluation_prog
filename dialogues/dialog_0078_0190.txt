DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you too, I suppose. Well, I’ve been… unsteady. It’s difficult to explain. I just… feel off balance sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Feeling off balance” can mean a lot of different things. And it’s alright if the details are hazy – we'll work through it together. When you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That is difficult. Perhaps… a few months? Maybe longer? It’s hard to say exactly. My husband… he passed away not too long ago, and things haven’t been very clear since then, if that makes any sense. I apologize for not being more precise. It just… all feels a bit jumbled.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. It’s completely understandable that things feel jumbled right now, and absolutely no apology is necessary. Grief can affect us in so many ways. We’ll take our time. Let’s focus on this feeling of unsteadiness. Does it happen all the time, or are there specific situations when you notice it more?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… kind of you to say. Um… it’s not all the time, no. I think it’s worse when I’m… standing for long periods. My job… I operate a rotary drill, for oil and gas, and I’m on my feet quite a bit. It’s especially noticeable then, I believe. And… sometimes when I turn my head quickly? Though, I can’t say for certain. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by standing and potentially by quick head movements. And it’s intermittent – comes and goes. That’s helpful to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. And… occasionally a bit dizzy, but I always thought that was just from being on my feet so much. I haven't… fallen or anything, thankfully. No headaches, no blurred vision, nothing like that. Just… a general feeling of being… off. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and occasional dizziness. No falls, no headaches, no blurred vision. You’re describing it as a “general feeling of being off,” which I understand. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… not that I recall, no. I've always been fairly healthy, honestly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing… serious. I did have a rather… difficult pregnancy, many years ago, but I recovered fully, as far as I know. I’ve seen a doctor regularly for check-ups, but I don’t believe anything major ever came up. I'm… reasonably certain, anyway. My memory…
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical diagnoses, a difficult pregnancy in the past with a full recovery, and regular check-ups. We can always look back at those records if needed. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a daily multivitamin, that's about it. And… occasionally, ibuprofen, if I have a headache. But nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Not since… well, not since the pregnancy, many years ago. I don’t believe I’m allergic to anything either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a daily multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen for headaches, and no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I… I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/82, a little elevated but not significantly concerning. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Okay, Lilyanna, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Oh… this is… difficult. I… I don’t think I can hold it for very long. It's… worse when my eyes are closed.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It is more challenging with your eyes closed. And it's good that you recognized when you needed to stop. This suggests some balance impairment. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes open, and then alternate between touching your nose and my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ll try. Oh… that wasn’t very smooth. Let me try again. I… I seem to have lost some coordination. It's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. It’s clear there is some mild difficulty with coordination. It's good we're identifying this. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, it seems like you're experiencing some balance and coordination issues. It could be a number of things, including inner ear problems, neurological factors, or even medication side effects – although you're not on any regular medications besides the multivitamin. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. I’m thinking a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying deficiencies, and an MRI of your brain to check for any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… rather serious. Are you saying there’s something seriously wrong, Doctor? I… I suppose if it will help determine the cause, then yes, please. But I must confess, the thought of an MRI is a little frightening. Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be apprehensive, Lilyanna. An MRI is a very detailed imaging test, and it can sometimes be a little unsettling because it's a bit noisy and you have to lie very still. But it’s not painful. You'll be lying on a table that slides into a large machine, and we’ll give you headphones to help block out the noise. You'll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. I don't want you to worry unnecessarily. I’m ordering these tests to rule things out and to get a clear understanding of what’s causing your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. We’ll also schedule you with an ENT specialist - an ear, nose, and throat doctor - to evaluate your inner ear function. That’s often a common cause of balance problems. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests and schedule those appointments for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. If you think it’s best, then yes, go ahead and order the tests and schedule the appointments. I… I just want to know what’s happening. It’s the uncertainty that’s the most unsettling. And an ENT specialist… that sounds sensible, given my balance issues. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and to get you the care you need. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood panel and scheduled the MRI for next week on August 9th at 10:00 AM. I’ve also scheduled an appointment with Dr. Ramirez, the ENT specialist, for August 16th. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that might increase your risk of falling. And if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms – such as severe dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: August 9th and 16th… yes, I can manage that. Thank you. No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I… I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what’s being done. Thank you again. I suppose… I'll see you in a few weeks, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Take care, and I’ll see you in a few weeks. Have a good day. .
