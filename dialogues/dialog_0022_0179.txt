DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Yes. Well, it is… the words. They do not come so easily now. It is… frustrating, you understand? I… I have trouble finding the right words sometimes. It has been… a while now. I do not remember exactly when it started, but… it is a problem.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your speech, specifically finding the right words. That is frustrating, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. When you say it's been a while, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: A rough… estimate? Yes. Hmm… It is difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe more. Time… it slips away. I… I do not keep track so well anymore. It is not sudden, you understand. It is… gradual. Like a slow… fading. It happens mostly when I… when I am trying to explain something complicated. Like at work, with… compensation things. Or… benefits. Those are hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over approximately six months, and it seems to be more noticeable when you're dealing with complex topics, like work-related issues. That's helpful to know. Besides work, have you noticed it affecting other areas of your life – conversations with family or friends, for example?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I think so. With friends… sometimes I pause. A long pause. They… they are very patient. They know I… I am not always quick these days. And… my wife… she would always know what I meant. But… she is gone now. So… it is harder to explain things to others. It is… lonely, sometimes. I do not mean to be… sad. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very difficult, Sherrell. I’m sorry for your loss. It’s completely understandable that this has been more challenging since then. Let's focus on the words for now. When you're having trouble finding the right word, what does that feel like?
PATIENT: What does it feel like? Hmm… That is a good question. It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue. I can see it, almost. I know what I want to say, and I know what the word means, but… I cannot get it out. It is… frustrating. And then… sometimes I use the wrong word. A similar word, but… not the right one. And I know it is wrong, even as I say it. It is… a strange feeling. Like my brain is… slow. Or… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s like the word is there, accessible, but you can’t quite retrieve it, and sometimes you end up using a similar, but incorrect, word. And you’re aware of the mistake as it happens. That’s very descriptive, thank you. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. I… I do not think so. No headaches. No dizziness. My memory… well, my memory is not what it used to be, but I thought that was just… getting older. And… I sleep alright. Sometimes I feel… tired. But I work long hours. So… I do not know if that is related. No… I cannot think of anything else. Just the words. It is mostly the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no headaches, dizziness, or changes in sleep. You've noticed some general fatigue, but you attribute that to your work schedule. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Yes. Hmm… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it is controlled now with… pills. A small pill, every morning. And… I had a heart scare a few years ago, but they put a… a stent in. That seems to be alright now. Otherwise… I do not think so. Nothing major. I go to the doctor regularly for checkups. I have Medicare, you know. They… they keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had your appendix removed, a history of high blood pressure currently managed with medication, and a stent placed a few years ago. That’s helpful. And yes, Medicare does a good job of keeping track of things. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, I do not think so. I have never had a reaction to any… pills. Or… food. I eat everything. I used to be allergic to… cats, when I was a child. But I have not been around a cat in… many years. So… I do not think I am allergic to anything anymore. No, no allergies. I am quite sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… besides the blood pressure pill? Yes. Let me see… I take a small white pill for my… cholesterol. A statin, I think the doctor calls it. And… sometimes I take something for my… joints. When they ache. It is a… an anti-inflammatory. But only when I need it. Not every day. Just… when they bother me. And… that is it, I believe. Just those two. The blood pressure pill and the… cholesterol and joint one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and occasionally an anti-inflammatory for joint pain. Do you have any family history of neurological conditions, like stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: Neurological… conditions? Hmm… That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… memory problems when she was old. But the doctor said it was just… old age. Not Alzheimer’s, I do not think. My father… he had a stroke, many years ago. But he recovered. He lived a long life. And… that is all I can think of. No… I do not believe so. Not that I am aware of. My family… they did not talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some memory problems in old age, and your father had a stroke but recovered. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke or drink? No. I do not smoke. Never have. And I… rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps… a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. But… not very often. I prefer tea. Yes, tea. A nice, strong cup of tea. I do not drink much alcohol at all. It does not… agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke and only occasionally drink a glass of wine. Now, I'm going to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please… go ahead. I am… ready. I will just sit here, and do as you say. A neurological exam… sounds… thorough. I am happy you are being so… careful.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Finally, I'll ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Grip strength is equal bilaterally. Overall, your neurological exam is normal. However, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… of the brain? Yes… that sounds… serious. But… if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then… yes, alright. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and… an MRI. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… what is happening. To find out… why I cannot find the words. Yes, alright. Please… let me know what I need to do. When can I… schedule these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. An MRI is a precautionary step. It will give us a more detailed look at your brain and help us rule out any underlying causes for your difficulty with word-finding. I'll have my nurse schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, fasting. And we'll get the MRI scheduled as soon as possible – likely within the next week. The nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare for the MRI – it’s important to remove any metal objects before the scan. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a referral to a speech therapist for an evaluation. They can help assess your specific language difficulties and provide targeted exercises to improve your communication skills. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A speech therapist… yes, that sounds… helpful. I have not… thought of that. A speech therapist… to help me with the words. Yes, alright. That sounds good. Questions? Hmm… Yes, one question. What… what if the MRI… finds something? What if… it is something serious? I… I do not want to worry unnecessarily. But… I need to know. What if it is… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Sherrell. It's natural to be concerned about that. The vast majority of MRIs are normal, or show age-related changes that aren’t necessarily causing your symptoms. If we do find something, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s serious. It could be something small and manageable. If we find an abnormality, we'll discuss the results with you in detail and explain all your options for treatment. We would also likely refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. I want to emphasize that we're taking a proactive approach here. We're gathering information to understand what's going on, and we'll work together to develop the best plan of care for you. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what they show. I will give you a copy of the MRI request form, the speech therapist referral, and written instructions for the blood tests. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You have… explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your… patience. And your… kindness. It is… reassuring to know you are taking this seriously. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I will… schedule the tests tomorrow. And… I will see what the speech therapist says. I believe… that is all. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your appointments. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. .
