DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Pirl! It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s why I’m here. The pharmacy said I should come get it checked out by a doctor.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble with your blood pressure, as in, it’s been reading high at the pharmacy?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. It was high a couple of times when I went to get my usual stuff. The pharmacist was really nice, she checked it twice and then said I really ought to come see a doctor about it. She didn’t say what was wrong, just that it was high.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes. Pharmacists are very astute to catch those things. And it's good you’re following up. Do you happen to know what the readings were, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t remember the exact numbers. I’m terrible with numbers, honestly. She wrote it down on the receipt, but I think I threw it out with some other junk mail. It was definitely above what she said was normal, though. She looked a little worried when she told me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s quite alright. We can certainly take a reading here and see what’s going on. I'm going to need to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is…new. Nobody’s ever told me anything about my blood pressure being a problem before. I usually feel pretty good, to be honest. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. Feeling tired is common. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the usual over-the-counter stuff if I have a headache or a cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything! My grandmother always said I had a cast iron stomach. She used to let me try all sorts of things when I was little, and I never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A strong stomach is a blessing. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mom had high blood pressure, I think. She was always going to the doctor. And my grandfather…he had something with his heart, I remember her talking about it. He had to be really careful with his salt. That was a long time ago, though. I was just a little girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Family history is important. Now, before we take your blood pressure, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life! My grandmother, she smoked, but I always thought it was a terrible habit. I try to stay healthy, you know? Not perfect, but I try.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing crazy, just a little bit to relax. It's usually with my meal, not on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good information. Now, let’s get a better picture of your activity level. How much exercise do you typically get in a week?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t really exercise, exercise. I walk a lot, though. I walk to the grocery store, and I walk my little dog, Peanut, every day. It's probably about a mile, maybe a little more. I also do a bit of gardening. Is that exercise? I do a lot of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, gardening is exercise! Walking and gardening both count. That's good. Now, let's just quickly go over your social history. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I work as a…well, it’s a bit of everything, really. Personal care, helping people out with little things. Errands, cleaning, that sort of thing. I like keeping busy. It keeps me out of trouble!
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, do you have any significant stressors in your life right now?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really, not that I can think of. Life’s just…life, you know? A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Nothing major. I keep pretty busy, which helps. I try not to dwell on things. It doesn't do any good.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mykeisha. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good to me! I’m ready whenever you are. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I really don't want to have to take pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let’s see what we find first, and then we can discuss all of your options. Alright, if you could just relax your arm for me… Just breathe normally… Okay. Blood pressure is 158 over 92. A bit elevated. And your pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m going to take your temperature and check your reflexes now… Reflexes are normal. Temperature is 98.6. Everything seems within normal limits, other than the blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh. 158? Is that bad? My mom’s blood pressure was always high, I remember that. What does this mean, Dr. Pirl? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking these questions. 158 over 92 is elevated. We classify that as Stage 2 hypertension. It does mean we need to address it. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be overly worried. We caught it early, and there are several things we can do. And yes, your mother’s history is relevant. Family history does play a role. We need to confirm this reading with a few more checks over the next few days, and then we can discuss lifestyle modifications and, potentially, medication. It’s important to protect your heart and kidneys. First, though, let's rule out anything else that might be causing this. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: No, no headaches or anything like that. And my vision is fine, as far as I know. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said everything was good. No chest pain either. Just a little tired sometimes, like I said before. But I figured that was just from being busy. And maybe the heat. It’s been so hot lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No headaches, vision changes, or chest pain. Just the usual tiredness. I'm going to order some routine blood work and a urine test. This will help us rule out any underlying causes of your high blood pressure, like kidney problems or other medical conditions. I'll also ask you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I’ll give you a list of instructions on how to do that properly. It’s important to get accurate readings. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Monitoring it myself… I guess that makes sense. Where can I get a blood pressure monitor? Do I need a special one? And what if I don't know how to use it? I'm not very good with gadgets.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question. You can get a blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even Walmart. You don't need a fancy one, just a standard upper-arm monitor will do. The pharmacist can help you choose one that's right for you. And don’t worry about knowing how to use it. The pharmacist can also show you how to take your blood pressure correctly. It’s important to sit quietly for five minutes beforehand, and to use the correct cuff size. I’ll also write down a few tips for you. Bring the results with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. We'll review them and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. I think I can handle that. The pharmacy is right down the street, so it won't be a problem to ask them. And writing down the tips is a good idea – I always forget things! So, I monitor it for a week, bring the results back, and then we’ll talk about what to do next? What kind of things are we talking about? Pills? Are there other ways to lower it besides taking medicine? I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly right. Monitor your blood pressure for a week, bring the results back, and then we’ll discuss the best plan for you. And you’re right to ask about alternatives to medication. In many cases, lifestyle modifications can be very effective in lowering blood pressure. These include things like reducing your sodium intake – less salt in your diet – eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, getting regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress. We can also talk about limiting alcohol consumption. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, or if your blood pressure is very high, then medication may be necessary. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let’s focus on the blood pressure monitoring first, and then we can review the results and create a personalized plan. Does that sound like a good approach?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Lifestyle changes first – I can definitely try that. Less salt, more fruits and veggies… I think I can manage that. And walking Peanut is good exercise, right? I’ll start monitoring it tomorrow. Thank you, Dr. Pirl. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I was so worried when I first came in here, but I feel much better now. I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're a team in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way. And yes, walking Peanut is excellent exercise! If you experience any sudden headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Here’s my card. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in a week. Have a good day, and enjoy your time with Peanut.
