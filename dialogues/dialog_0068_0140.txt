DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… unpleasant. Something’s going on in my mouth, and my wife insisted I come. I don't usually bother with these things unless absolutely necessary. It's probably nothing, but she gets very anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Sometimes a second opinion is helpful, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Can you describe what's going on in your mouth?
PATIENT: Well, it's… white. Patches. Inside my mouth, mostly on my tongue. And it… it’s a little uncomfortable. Not exactly painful, but… irritating. Like a constant film. It’s quite bothersome when I eat, actually. It's rather… unrefined, if you understand what I mean. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it doesn't seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: White patches, you said, primarily on your tongue… and it feels irritating, especially with food. How long have you noticed these patches, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It's been… at least a week, maybe longer. It came on gradually, so I didn't immediately pay attention. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a very keen eye for these things. I suppose it's been… ten days, perhaps? It's difficult to say with any certainty. I don’t keep track of these trivial details.
DOCTOR: Ten days, gradually appearing... Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the white patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not really. Perhaps a slightly… odd taste in my mouth sometimes, but nothing significant. It could just be what I ate. Honestly, Doctor, I assure you it’s probably nothing. I eat very well, maintain a good lifestyle. I doubt it's anything serious. Are you going to… look inside my mouth now? I find it rather unpleasant, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schieber, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s important to take a look, just to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. It helps me rule things out and ensure everything is alright. It won’t take long. Would you prefer I tell you exactly what I'm doing as I examine you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I would appreciate that. A full explanation, if you don't mind. And please be careful. I have… a sensitive constitution, you see. I prefer not to be surprised. Just… tell me what you’re doing before you do it. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I’m going to use this tongue depressor to gently hold your tongue out of the way so I can get a better view of the inside of your mouth. I'll use the light to illuminate the area. I’m looking for the size, shape, and location of the white patches, and I'll also check for any redness or swelling. I’ll also gently palpate your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds acceptable. Though I must reiterate, I find this rather unnecessary. But if you insist… be gentle, please. And do hurry. I have appointments this afternoon. Very important ones.
DOCTOR: Alright… I see the white patches you described, mostly on the dorsal surface of your tongue. They appear somewhat irregular in shape, and I do see a little redness around the edges. No obvious swelling or any other lesions that I can see at this moment. Your tongue appears to be a normal size and texture otherwise. And I don’t see any signs of any other problems in the oral cavity. It appears… potentially consistent with oral thrush, or candidiasis. Have you ever had this before, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Thrush? Candidiasis? No, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Sounds… unpleasant. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain impeccable hygiene. This is rather… concerning. Is it contagious? My wife and I… we travel frequently.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Schieber. Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by Candida, and it’s not typically a sign of poor hygiene. It can occur for various reasons, like a weakened immune system, certain medications, or even just changes in oral pH. It can be mildly contagious, but usually through direct contact – sharing utensils or kissing, for instance. It’s not typically spread through casual contact. Now, have you been taking any antibiotics recently?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? No, not recently. I avoid medications whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, you understand. And my immune system is… robust. I lead a very healthy lifestyle. I simply cannot fathom how I contracted this… thrush. Is it… serious? Will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, in most cases, thrush is not serious, especially in someone who is otherwise healthy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your concern and the fact that you haven't been on antibiotics, I’d like to get a quick swab of the affected area to confirm the diagnosis and ensure there's nothing else going on. It’s a very simple procedure, doesn’t cause any discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Another… procedure? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. Is it absolutely necessary? I really must be going shortly. My appointments, you see… And what exactly will this swab reveal? More unpleasantness, I presume?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. The swab will allow us to identify the specific cause of the white patches, confirming whether it is indeed Candida or something else. If it is Candida, it’s a straightforward treatment. If not, knowing what we're dealing with will ensure we get you the most appropriate care. The procedure is very quick—less than a minute. It involves gently swabbing the affected area to collect a sample for analysis. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. Without confirming the diagnosis, I would be making an educated guess, and I prefer to have a definitive answer before prescribing any treatment.
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick and gentle, Doctor. And explain precisely what you are doing before you do it. I abhor surprises. And I expect a full explanation of the results afterwards. I trust you understand.
