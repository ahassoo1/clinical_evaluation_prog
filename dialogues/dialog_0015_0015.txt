DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… my sinuses, I think. They been bothering me for a little while now. It's hard to say how long, exactly. Everything feels… fuzzy, you know? But not good.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is… not terribly specific, Ms. Boham. Can you be more precise?
PATIENT: Precise… oh dear. Let me think. It’s… a pressure. Right here, and here. <points to both sides of her nose and forehead> It feels like… a headache, but inside my face? And sometimes… sometimes it’s hard to breathe through my nose. Not all the time, but when it’s bad. Does that make sense? I don’t… I don’t remember how it started. I just woke up one day and… it was there.
DOCTOR: So, pressure in your forehead and around your nose, feeling like it's inside your face, and nasal congestion at times. And you haven’t been able to pinpoint when this started. Any fever, chills, or cough accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot, if that makes sense. And no cough. Not that I remember, anyway. I… sometimes my memory isn't very good. Chills… no. No chills. It's mostly just… this pressure. And it makes it hard to concentrate. I work… I work with the drills, you know? Oil work. It’s important to pay attention. But this… this makes it hard.
DOCTOR: Right. Oil work requires focus. I understand. And this has been impacting your ability to concentrate. Now, Ms. Boham, have you noticed any colored mucus – green, yellow, or even blood – when you blow your nose?
PATIENT: Colored… mucus? Oh. Um… I… I don’t usually pay much attention, Doctor. I think… I think sometimes it’s a little… darker than usual. Maybe yellow-ish? But I can’t say for sure. I just… wipe my nose and… that's it. I don’t really look. I’m sorry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… unhelpful, Ms. Boham. Paying attention to your body is important. Yellow mucus can indicate an infection. Have you experienced any facial pain, particularly when bending over?
PATIENT: Facial pain… bending over… <she pauses, tilting her head> I… I don't think so. I mean, sometimes my face feels… heavy. Like there's weight on it. But I don't feel pain when I bend. We have to… move around a lot at work, you know? Bending, lifting… I don't remember anything specific about pain. My husband usually tells me when something’s wrong. I just… feel tired. And the pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and take a look at your throat. It will only take a few minutes. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds… good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. <she slowly rises and walks towards the examination table, looking a little apprehensive> I hope it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work later. But I appreciate you seeing me. This pressure is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Please sit forward. I'll start with listening to your lungs. Take deep breaths, Ms. Boham. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. Tenderness on the right maxillary sinus. Throat looks clear, but slightly inflamed.
PATIENT: <she flinches when the doctor touches her right cheek> Ouch. Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. It’s been hurting more lately, I think. Especially when the weather changes. It’s silly, but… the pressure feels worse when it rains. I don’t know why. Is it… bad, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just want to feel better. <she looks worried, clutching her hands in her lap>
DOCTOR: The weather does not cause sinus infections, Ms. Boham. However, changes in barometric pressure can exacerbate symptoms. Your right maxillary sinus is definitely tender. Given your symptoms – pressure, nasal congestion, yellow mucus, and tenderness – it appears you have a likely case of acute sinusitis. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… I don’t think so. My husband, he has hay fever, but I’ve never had problems with… pollen or anything. Maybe… maybe dust? Sometimes I cough when I’m cleaning, but I thought that was just from the dust. We live… we live near the oil fields, you know? It’s very dusty there. But I’ve never had a proper allergy test, if that’s what you mean. <she shrugs helplessly> I just get… tired, mostly. And this pressure.
DOCTOR: Right. Given your lack of known allergies and the presentation, we'll treat this as a likely bacterial sinusitis. I'm going to prescribe you a course of amoxicillin. It’s important you complete the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. I’m also recommending saline nasal rinses twice daily to help clear the congestion.
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… okay. I can… I can get that, right? I don't have… insurance, Doctor. Would that be a problem? And saline… is that like, a nose spray? I’m not very good with… medicines. My husband usually handles all of that. But he’s working out of town right now, and I didn’t want to wait. <she looks anxious, twisting her hands>
DOCTOR: Yes, you can obtain amoxicillin without insurance, though the cost will be higher. I can provide you with a list of pharmacies offering discount programs. As for the saline, it’s a nasal rinse. You can purchase a pre-mixed solution or make your own with non-iodized salt and distilled water. I will have the nurse provide you with instructions. Complete the entire ten-day course, and if your symptoms do not improve within a week, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial swelling, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Ten days… okay, I can remember that. And the nurse will help with the saline. That’s good. <she takes the slip of paper gratefully> A fever… yes, I remember you saying that before. And swelling… oh dear. I don’t want that. <she pauses, looking worried> No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you… thank you very much for seeing me. It’s… reassuring to know what’s wrong, even if it sounds… complicated. I’ll make sure to get the medicine and follow the instructions carefully. <she slowly rises, looking slightly relieved>
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to get adequate rest, and stay hydrated. The nurse will be in shortly to review discharge instructions. And Ms. Boham, perhaps you should encourage your husband to prioritize your health when he returns. Proper self-care is essential.
