DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I understand I need to discuss… plans for the future, should something unexpected happen. I believe it has something to do with making sure my wishes are known, if I am unable to… communicate them myself? I was advised to seek out an Advance Directive or a POLST form, though I confess the details are rather hazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re looking to discuss advance care planning – a very responsible step, Ms. Buoniconti. It sounds like someone suggested an Advance Directive or a POLST form. Those are both excellent options for ensuring your wishes are respected. To help me understand your needs better, let's start with a little bit about your current health. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think I’m generally healthy. I work with… very fine tools, etching and engraving, so it requires a steady hand and good eyesight, which I thankfully still possess. I don’t recall any major illnesses recently. I had a rather unpleasant bout of… something, a few years ago – a fever, I believe, and a terrible cough – but it resolved on its own. Nothing requiring… ongoing treatment, as far as I know. It’s all a bit… fragmented, you see. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly common to have difficulty recalling details, especially regarding past illnesses. We can work through this together. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm… those sound familiar, but… no, I don’t believe so. I don’t take any regular medications, if that’s any indication. I think my doctor back… where I was previously living… mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high once, but it wasn’t anything that required pills, or lifestyle changes, as far as I remember. I really do apologize for being so vague. It’s frustrating, even for me. Perhaps it’s the stress of… well, everything.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Buoniconti. We'll take things at your pace. It's good that you don't currently take any medications. And it’s not uncommon for cholesterol to be monitored. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing that I recall, at least. I had my tonsils removed as a child, I think. A very long time ago. But that was… routine, I suppose. As for hospitalizations… I vaguely remember a bout of… food poisoning, perhaps, many years ago. A very unpleasant night, but I recovered quickly. It wasn’t… serious. I truly am struggling to recall specifics. Is it alright if we perhaps focus on what I would like to happen, rather than dwelling on the past? This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. We can definitely shift our focus to your wishes. It's perfectly reasonable to prioritize that, especially if recalling past medical history is causing you stress. Before we do that, just a few quick questions to complete the picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I think I’m allergic to… certain pollens. I get a rather stuffy nose and watery eyes during the spring, but it’s manageable with… over-the-counter remedies. Nothing severe. As for food or medications… I don’t recall any life-threatening allergies. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I know. Though, I do get a mild rash if I handle certain metals… nickel, I believe? But it’s a contact dermatitis, not a true allergy. It’s more of an… irritation. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. So, seasonal allergies and a contact dermatitis with nickel. We’ll make note of those. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. I wasn’t particularly close to my family. We… didn’t discuss such things. I know my mother lived to a fairly old age, but I don’t recall the specifics. She had… some sort of heart condition, I believe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he passed away rather suddenly, when I was young. I believe it was… a stroke? But again, the details are hazy. My siblings… I haven’t spoken to them in many years. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It's not that I’m deliberately withholding information, it’s simply… that I don’t have the information. Is it alright if we move on? Perhaps focusing on my own wishes would be… more productive?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Buoniconti. That is perfectly alright. Family history can be difficult to recall, and it's understandable that you don't have a lot of details. It's more important to focus on your own wishes and what's important to you. Let’s do that. As we discuss advance care planning, are you familiar with the difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid not. I only know that someone suggested them as a way to ensure my wishes are respected. I was told that they are… legal documents, of some kind? But beyond that, I have no understanding of what they entail. Perhaps you could explain the difference to me, in… simple terms? I confess, legal jargon makes me… quite anxious. I simply want to be certain that my preferences are honored, should I become unable to communicate them myself. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s a perfectly reasonable request, and that’s exactly what we’re here to do. Let me explain it in simple terms. An Advance Directive is a broad document. It lets you write down your wishes for your healthcare, generally for future situations. It can include a Living Will – which outlines what kinds of treatments you want or don't want if you're seriously ill – and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone you trust to make healthcare decisions for you if you can't. It's a more general plan for a range of possibilities. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a medical order. It's for people with serious illnesses or frailty, and it specifies specific medical treatments you want or don't want right now. It’s a more immediate, actionable document that healthcare providers follow. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… the Advance Directive is a more… comprehensive plan, outlining my overall wishes? And the POLST form is… a specific set of instructions for immediate medical care? I think… I think I understand. The POLST form sounds… more urgent, perhaps? For situations where… decisions need to be made quickly? Whereas the Advance Directive is a more… long-term plan? Am I grasping this correctly? It’s rather a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You are grasping it perfectly, Ms. Buoniconti! That’s an excellent way to put it. The POLST form is for situations where immediate decisions are needed, and it's based on your current wishes. The Advance Directive is a broader plan for a range of future possibilities. Given your concerns about ensuring your wishes are respected, and that you're primarily concerned about making sure your preferences are known if you're unable to communicate, which one sounds like a better fit for you at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… Given that I am relatively healthy, and my primary concern is simply ensuring my wishes are known… I believe the Advance Directive would be the more appropriate choice. The POLST form sounds… more relevant for someone with an immediate medical need, which is not my current situation. I want to be prepared, but I don’t… anticipate needing immediate life-sustaining treatment. Is that a reasonable conclusion? I apologize for taking so long to consider this. It’s… a rather weighty decision.
DOCTOR: That is a very reasonable conclusion, Ms. Buoniconti, and a very thoughtful one. An Advance Directive is an excellent choice for your situation. It allows you to clearly outline your preferences for future healthcare decisions. Now, the Advance Directive has two main parts, as we discussed – the Living Will and the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. Let's start with the Durable Power of Attorney. This is about choosing someone you trust to make healthcare decisions for you if you can’t. Do you have someone in mind who you would want to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I… don’t have a great many close relationships. My family… we are not close. And I’ve moved around quite a bit, so I haven’t formed lasting friendships. There’s… a colleague, perhaps? A fellow etcher, named Elias Thorne. He’s… reliable, and quite sensible. He’s not family, but he’s the closest thing I have to a friend, I suppose. Would he be a suitable choice? I haven’t discussed this with him, so I don’t know if he’d be willing.
DOCTOR: Elias Thorne sounds like a reasonable choice, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly alright that you haven't discussed this with him yet. It's important to choose someone you trust, and he seems to fit that description. It's also important that he's willing and able to fulfill the role. We can provide you with some information to share with him, explaining his responsibilities. Before we move on to the Living Will, would you like me to provide you with that information now, or would you prefer to think about it a little longer?
PATIENT: I believe… information would be helpful. Perhaps if I have something to show him, it will make the conversation easier. It’s… a rather awkward topic, as it is. I would appreciate any materials you can provide, explaining his responsibilities and… the process, should he agree to be my healthcare proxy. Thank you, Doctor. This is… very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconti. Here is a brochure explaining the role of a healthcare proxy – it outlines their responsibilities, how to make decisions in accordance with your wishes, and what to do in different situations. I can also print out a form that you can use to officially designate Elias as your healthcare proxy, once you’ve spoken to him. Take your time reviewing these materials, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Once you’ve designated your healthcare proxy, we can move on to discussing the Living Will – outlining your specific wishes for end-of-life care. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: This is… very thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I believe… this is all I need for now. I would like to review this information with Elias, and then schedule another appointment to discuss the Living Will. You’ve been very patient and understanding, and I truly appreciate your assistance. I believe I’m… less anxious now, knowing that I have a plan in place. Thank you again, Doctor Soodeen. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm glad I could help. Taking the initiative to plan for the future is a very responsible step, and you should be proud of yourself. Please don't hesitate to reach out when you’re ready to discuss the Living Will. My staff will be happy to schedule an appointment for you. Have a good day as well, Ms. Buoniconti, and please take care. .
