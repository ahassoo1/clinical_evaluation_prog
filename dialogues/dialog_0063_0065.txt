DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste time. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about my weight. I’ve… gained some, unexpectedly. It’s quite bothersome, really. I haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: Unexpected weight gain. Yes, well, these things happen. How long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I believe, around late February, perhaps early March. So, roughly five months now. It’s not a dramatic change week to week, but it adds up, you understand? I weigh myself regularly, so I do know.
DOCTOR: Regularly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, every Monday morning, first thing. After… after using the facilities, of course. It’s always the same scale, the one in the bathroom. I’ve had it for years, so it shouldn’t be inaccurate. It's... a habit, really. My mother always weighed herself on Mondays.
DOCTOR: A family tradition. Right. And approximately how much weight would you say you’ve gained over these five months, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Let me see… I started at 168 pounds, and as of this morning, I was 183. So… about 15 pounds, give or take. It’s… unsettling. I’ve never had trouble with my weight before.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in five months. And you’ve stated no changes in diet or exercise?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Absolutely no changes. I eat the same things I always have – mostly potatoes, some cabbage, a bit of meat when my husband hunts. And I walk to the market most days, and help with the garden. It's all quite normal, really. I haven’t been less active, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I sleep alright, though sometimes I wake up a little stiff. And I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I attribute that to the heat, honestly. It’s been dreadfully warm this summer. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Stiffness and fatigue. Vague symptoms, Ms. Selbitschka. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My appetite is the same as always. I eat when I’m hungry, stop when I’m full. It’s… a normal amount, I suppose. I haven't been craving anything unusual, or eating more, or less. It’s very peculiar, this whole situation. I really don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A bit of a cold now and then, like everyone, but never anything serious. No operations, no chronic illnesses, nothing. My husband always says I’m as sturdy as an oak tree. Though, clearly, something is amiss now.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 87, and she was healthy until the very end, just… old age. My father died young, a hunting accident, but he didn't have any particular illnesses. My brother is fine, a little overweight, perhaps, but otherwise healthy. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no cancer… nothing like that, thankfully. We're a rather robust family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None at all. I can take most things without issue. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings, and we have quite a few bees in the garden. My husband tried to give me some chamomile tea once, for my nerves, but I didn't care for the taste. That’s the closest I’ve come to a reaction, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. My husband keeps some liniment for his back, but I don't use it. I've never needed anything stronger than a good night's sleep. Is this… relevant to the weight gain? I'm starting to feel quite foolish, to be honest. It's just… weight.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s perform a brief physical examination. Please, step onto the scale again and then proceed. It’s just to confirm your reported weight. It’s… standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If you insist. It’s just… I already weighed myself this morning. But if it’s standard, I suppose I must.
DOCTOR: 84 kilograms. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is regular at 72. Thyroid feels normal to palpation. Lungs are clear. No edema in the extremities. Everything appears… within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though, it doesn’t explain the weight. Are you sure there isn’t something? I feel as though we are going in circles. Perhaps a blood test? I don’t mind, if it will help determine the cause.
DOCTOR: A blood test… very well. It will rule out the obvious. But I suspect this is simply a matter of… lifestyle factors. I'll order a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll need a sample from you now. Nurse will be with you momentarily. Do not eat or drink anything after this visit, aside from water.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I understand. So, just the blood test then? And no eating after today? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the blood test. The nurse will explain the process. We’ll review the results in approximately one week. If anything significant appears, we’ll discuss further intervention. Do try to maintain a consistent diet in the meantime. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. .
