DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. It’s been…oh, goodness, maybe a month now? It started small, just a little tickle, but now it's really bothering me, especially when I lie down. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer, to be honest. Time gets away from me these days. It’s worse at night, like I said. And it feels…deep. Not just in my chest, but deep. It's tiring, always coughing. I have to sit up to sleep.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, my ankles…they’ve been swelling up something awful. Especially in the evenings. And I get so winded just walking to the kitchen. Used to be I could putter around all day, but now……not so much. And I'm always feeling tired, even after a nap.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles…and shortness of breath. Very well. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills that I've noticed. And I haven’t had any night sweats. I sleep pretty warm, always have, but nothing unusual. Just…tired. And this cough, of course. It feels like something is…well, I don’t know how to explain it. Like fluid. Does that make sense? I used to have a little bit of trouble with fluid, years ago. The doctor put me on some pills for it. I still take them.
DOCTOR: You mentioned taking pills for fluid…can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... It's a little white pill... hmm. Here it is! Furosemide. Yes, that’s it. 40 milligrams. I take one every morning. Been taking it for... goodness, must be ten years now? Doctor Ramirez prescribed it to me. He retired a while back.
DOCTOR: Furosemide 40 milligrams…very good. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see... Oh, yes. I take a little bit of potassium, because the water pill takes some of that away, you know? Just 20 milligrams of potassium chloride every day. And sometimes, if I’m really achy, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But not very often. I try to avoid that, if I can. It bothers my stomach sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. Though I don't eat much red meat anymore, it doesn't sit well with me. But that’s just preference, not an allergy. I'm pretty lucky, that way. Never been much of a sickly person, until recently, of course. This cough…it's really got me worried.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Years ago, when I was younger, I had pneumonia, very bad. Had to stay in the hospital for a week. That was in El Salvador, though, a long time ago. And then......when my husband was sick, I was in and out of the hospital with him, of course, but that wasn't for me. And...oh! I had my gallbladder taken out, maybe fifteen years ago. That was here, at this very hospital. Everything went well, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a long story. My mother, she had a weak heart. Always tired, always short of breath. She died when I was still young, maybe in her sixties. And my father, he had diabetes. He lost his leg because of it. And my brother…he had high blood pressure, but he took his pills and lived to be a good old age. It's mostly heart trouble and sugar sickness in my family, I think. Not a very healthy bunch, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no…those things. Never touched them, never wanted to. I always said, "What good would that do?" I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was a young woman, but my husband didn't like it, so I stopped. That was…oh, goodness, sixty years ago, at least. I've always been a very healthy person, until recently. This cough…it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose that's what doctors do. It's a little cold, isn't it? Do you mind if I keep my shawl?
DOCTOR: Please do. Take a deep breath...and exhale. Another deep breath... Good. There are some rhonchi in the lower lobes, bilaterally. There is slight tenderness upon palpation here. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. And I notice some peripheral edema in your ankles…as you mentioned. It's pitting edema. Alright. Thank you. Now, please sit up slowly.
PATIENT: Oh my. That was...thorough. What does all that mean, Doctor? Rhonchi...murmur...pitting edema? Is it bad? This cough is really worrying me, and now you're saying all these things… Is it my heart? I’ve always been a little afraid of my heart, ever since my mother…
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, your examination reveals signs consistent with possible congestive heart failure, exacerbated by a respiratory infection. The rhonchi indicate fluid in your lungs, the murmur suggests a valve abnormality, and the edema confirms fluid retention. However, we need to confirm this with further testing. I will order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and a complete blood count. We also need to check your B-type natriuretic peptide – a marker for heart failure. In the meantime, I am prescribing you a diuretic – a stronger one than you are currently taking – and a course of antibiotics for the infection. I also recommend a low-sodium diet and strict fluid restriction. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. That sounds serious. Congestive heart failure? Like my mother? And all these tests… A stronger water pill…and antibiotics…and no salt? That’s… a lot. And… what’s a B-type something or other? Is it painful? I’m not sure I understand all of this, Doctor. And… is this something I can fix? Will I be alright? I just want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, please. The B-type natriuretic peptide is a simple blood test. It is not painful. It helps us assess the severity of the heart failure. As for being “fixed,” that depends on the extent of the damage, and how well you adhere to the treatment plan. The antibiotics will address the infection, which is currently putting strain on your heart. The stronger diuretic will help remove the excess fluid. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Here are the prescriptions and the referral information. Please make those appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A cardiologist… that sounds even more serious. And all these appointments… I barely get out of the house as it is. I… I suppose I understand about the pills and trying to get rid of the fluid. But what if I forget? My memory isn’t what it used to be. And… what kind of diet is low-sodium? Can I still have my coffee? I just… I feel so overwhelmed, Doctor. Is there someone who can explain all this to me again, maybe in simpler terms? Someone who… who has a little more time?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, I have a very busy schedule, as you can imagine. I have explained the situation to the best of my ability. The information is readily available online, and the cardiologist’s office will be happy to answer any further questions you may have. I suggest you have a family member accompany you to the appointments. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have other patients waiting. .
