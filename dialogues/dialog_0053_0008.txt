DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Uh… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Been that way a little while now, I think. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a full ear, you say. “A little while now” isn’t terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, you're right. It isn’t. Everything is a bit… hazy these days. Maybe… a few weeks? A month? It’s hard to say, really. Not a sharp pain, just… blocked. Annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything caused it, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Caused it…? Not that I recall. I work outside, mostly. Agricultural inspections, you see. Lots of wind, sometimes. Could be that? I don’t… I don't remember anything specific happening. No loud noises or anything. Just… gradual. Everything feels gradual these days, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. Agricultural inspections… so, you're exposed to the elements quite a bit. And you said it's been a month or so?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. A month, give or take. Wind, sun, dust… all of it. I suppose it could be something to do with that. I really wouldn't know. I just thought it best to get it checked, before it got… worse, I guess. It hasn’t gotten much worse, but it’s still… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the fullness, are you experiencing any pain, discharge, ringing in the ear, dizziness, or any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A little pressure sometimes, but not pain. Discharge? No. Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe a very faint ringing. It's barely noticeable. And dizziness… no, I don't think so. Hearing… that's a tricky one. Everything sounds a bit muffled, maybe? But I always thought that was just… getting older. It’s hard to say if it’s changed or not. Honestly, everything feels a bit muted these days. Sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. You’re providing information, and that’s helpful. Muffled hearing and faint ringing… okay. Let's have a quick look in your ear, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. The sooner we figure it out, the better. I have… things to do, you see. Not important things, but… things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it appears you have a bit of earwax buildup – cerumen impaction, we call it. And a little redness in the ear canal. It doesn’t look overly concerning at this point, but the wax is likely contributing to the fullness and muffled hearing. It's not unusual, especially with your line of work. Dust and wind can pack it in there.
PATIENT: Earwax, you say? That's… actually quite a relief. I was imagining something much worse. So, it’s not… serious? Just a bit of build-up? I can get that removed, can I? Is it painful? Honestly, I’m not very good with things in my ears.
DOCTOR: No, it's not serious at all, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Very common. And yes, we can absolutely remove it. There are a few ways to do it. We can try a simple irrigation with water, or I can use a small curette to gently scoop it out. The irrigation is usually the most comfortable option, although some people find it a little strange. The curette… well, it’s a bit more direct. Neither should be particularly painful, but you might feel some pressure. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Scooping…? No, definitely not scooping. Irrigation sounds… preferable. Less… invasive. Pressure I can handle, I think. I’ve had a lot of wind pressure in my life, if that counts. As long as it's not too much pressure, I’m happy to try the water. Let's do the water, please. The sooner this is over, the better. Sorry, I’m probably being a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Alright, irrigation it is. We’ll gently flush out the earwax with warm water. It might feel a bit odd, like a pressure change, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'll have you lie down on your side so I can get a good angle. I’ll need you to let me know if you feel any pain or dizziness during the procedure. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… fine. Pain or dizziness, I’ll let you know. Though, as I said, I’m not very good at noticing things. I tend to… zone out. Just… go ahead. The sooner it's done, the better, you know? I appreciate you fitting me in. It's just… I have things. Things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. We'll get this taken care of as quickly as possible. Okay, that’s a good start. Let’s take a look and see how we’ve done. Alright, that's significantly better. The ear canal is much clearer now, and the tympanic membrane looks normal. We got most of it out, but there might be a tiny bit remaining. Do you notice any difference in your hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. It does feel… clearer. Not perfect, but definitely not as muffled as before. A bit… airy, maybe? It’s hard to explain. Yes, much better. It’s a relief, honestly. Is that all I needed? Just the wax removed? I really appreciate it, Doctor. I should probably be getting going. I have… things.
DOCTOR: Yes, it seems that was the main issue. Sometimes, a simple wax removal is all it takes. I'll recommend keeping your ears dry for a few days to prevent any infection. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they tend to push the wax further in. If you notice any pain, discharge, or a significant change in your hearing, please come back and see me. Now, about your “things”… I do have to ask, as part of my record, do you have any allergies, or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I've never really paid much attention. Medications… no, nothing. I don’t believe in them, really. Just… fresh air and hard work. That's what keeps me going. Honestly, I try to avoid doctors as much as possible. But you've been very efficient, I must say. I really should be getting going now. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve saved me a lot of… trouble. Things to do, you know? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Well, I’m glad I could help. Please, if anything changes, don’t hesitate to come back. And perhaps consider keeping a list of any potential allergies or medications, just for future reference. It's better to be safe than sorry. Things… always things. .
