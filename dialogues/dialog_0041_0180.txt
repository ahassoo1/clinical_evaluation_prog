DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, okay? I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I… I don’t know. I keep wanting to eat dirt. Sounds crazy, I know. It just… feels right, somehow. Don't ask me why. I just do. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No worries, we’ll take it at your pace. Tired, and… a craving for dirt. That is unusual. When did you first start feeling this extreme tiredness?
PATIENT: Extreme? Honestly, I’ve been tired for… a long time. Years, maybe? It’s just gotten worse lately. Hard to say exactly when it started. Things blur together, you know? I just remember feeling… less and less energy. And the dirt thing… maybe a couple months ago? It started small. Just a little taste. Now… well, now I have to stop myself. It's embarrassing. Can we skip the whole “when did it start” thing? It's not important.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can definitely move on, but just to get a better picture… would you say this tiredness is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Always. Some days are worse than others, but it's always there. Like a weight on my chest. I just… I don’t have the energy for things anymore. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And honestly, I don't even want to do things. Is that part of being tired, or…? Look, I just want to know what's wrong with me, okay? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. It sounds incredibly draining to feel that way. Okay, so constant tiredness, a feeling of heaviness… and this unusual craving. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kind of changes? I... I don't know. I don’t pay attention to stuff like that. My memory isn’t what it used to be, for one. And… I guess I’ve been a little… shorter with people? My neighbor asked me to water her plants last week and I just… snapped at her. I felt bad afterwards, but… it just slipped out. Does that count? Look, I’m a widow, okay? I live alone. Things are… different now. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory issues, a bit of irritability… and you've been feeling this way since becoming a widow. That's all helpful information. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember to eat. Sometimes I forget. Other times I just don't feel like it. It's not that I'm not hungry, exactly. It's just… food seems… pointless. Except for the dirt, of course. I actually crave that. Which is… weird, I know. Please, can we just get to the bottom of this? I have things to do. Or, I would if I had energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fluctuating appetite, but you do have cravings specifically for dirt. And you mentioned feeling tired for years, with it worsening recently. Now, this might sound a little strange, but have you noticed any… unusual things you’ve been eating besides the dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you seriously asking me about more things I eat? Look, I already told you about the dirt! It’s embarrassing enough! No, I haven’t been eating anything else weird. Just… normal food, sometimes. And the dirt. That’s it. Why do you keep asking me about this? It's not like I'm eating rocks or anything! This is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I apologize if I'm repeating myself. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible. The craving for dirt, a medical term for it is pica, can sometimes be related to nutritional deficiencies. That's why I'm asking about your eating habits. Before we get to tests, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've experienced?
