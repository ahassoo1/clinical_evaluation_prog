DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look here, Doctor, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it's about how I look. It's getting ridiculous. I used to be a strong man, you see? Pile driving, hard work. Now... not so much. I want somethin' done about it. Not talkin' about feelin's, talkin' about fixin' it.
DOCTOR: Right. “How you look.” I see. And what specifically about how you look is concerning you, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Concerning me? Everything! Look at these arms, Doctor. Skin hangin' like old washin'. And my belly… used to be a flat board, now it's… well, you see it. I ain’t askin’ for a miracle, just wantin' it tighter. Less… jiggly. Is that somethin' you can do? Don't tell me 'bout diet and exercise, I tried those.
DOCTOR: So, you’re concerned about loose skin and changes in your body composition. You’ve already attempted diet and exercise, and are looking for… a more direct intervention. I understand. Now, just to be clear, are you experiencing any functional limitations because of these changes?
PATIENT: Functional limitations? What kinda question is that? I can still walk, still cook my own food. But tryin' to get a proper shirt on is a struggle, alright? And I don't like lookin' at myself in the mirror no more. That’s a limitation if you ask me. It affects my… spirit. But don't go makin' it complicated with fancy words, Doctor. Just tell me if you can tighten things up or not.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I appreciate you being direct. However, simply “tightening things up” isn’t a medical procedure. We need to understand why these changes have occurred, and what options, if any, are appropriate and safe for someone your age and with your medical history. I see here you have private insurance, which is good. Now, have you noticed any recent weight loss, or has this been a gradual process over time?
PATIENT: Gradual, Doctor. Very gradual. Not like I lost a whole heap of weight all at once. Just… slippin' away, year after year. And I told you, I ain't interested in why! I used to be built like a brick house, workin' them piles. Now I'm… well, you see. Insurance is fine, but don't go tryin' to run up a bill, alright? I ain’t made of money. Just want somethin’ done, and quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We'll try to be efficient. Gradual weight loss… and you’re concerned about the associated skin laxity. Now, can you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? What do you want to know? I eat normal food. Fish, chicken, rice and peas, dumplings… Jamaican food, you know? Not junk food all the time, but I like a good plate of food. Been eatin' like that for seventy-six years, don't see no reason to change now. What's that got to do with my belly, anyway?
DOCTOR: It helps me understand your overall health, Mr. Trendler. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No! Always had a good appetite. Still do. Maybe a little less than before, but I still enjoy my food. Look, are we gettin' anywhere here? I'm tellin' you I'm losin' muscle and skin and I want to do somethin' about it. You askin' me about what I eat like I'm a child.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or any difficulty with your daily activities other than getting a shirt on?
PATIENT: Look here, Doctor, you keep askin' me the same questions, just different ways! I told you, I can still do things. Walk, cook, garden a little. I'm not bedridden! But everything takes a little more effort now. Ain't no secret there. It's the look of it, alright? I feel… diminished. And I don't like it. Is there a pill you can give me or somethin'? Or can you just... fix it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, there is no “pill” to simply restore muscle mass or tighten skin. And “fixing it” requires a proper evaluation. I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination to assess your muscle mass, skin elasticity, and overall health. Then, we can discuss potential options, which may include physical therapy, nutritional counseling, or, possibly, cosmetic procedures. But first, let's start with an examination. Can you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale? Look here, I know what I weigh! I ain't blind. But fine, do what you gotta do. Just don't take all day, alright? And don't be tellin' me I need to lose weight. I'm losin' enough weight as it is!
DOCTOR: 122 pounds. And your height is 178 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. One seventy-eight. Used to be a strong one seventy-eight, now… well, you see. Hurry up, Doctor. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Your BMI is 38.3, which indicates obesity. Now, let’s assess your muscle mass. Can you please remove your shirt and I'll take a look?
PATIENT: Obesity?! What?! I'm skin and bones! Look at me! I'm practically disappearin'! This is ridiculous. You don't need to look at nothin'! I told you, I'm losin' muscle, not gainin' weight!
DOCTOR: Please remain calm, Mr. Trendler. I am simply conducting a physical examination. Now, I can see some degree of muscle atrophy, which is consistent with your reported weight loss. However, there’s also evidence of subcutaneous fat. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to assess the degree of skin laxity. Please relax.
PATIENT: Hey! Watch it! What are you doin'? That's… uncomfortable. I told you, I ain’t made of stone! And what's "subcutaneous fat" mean anyway? Just tell me straight, Doctor, can you fix it or not? I don't need fancy words and pokin' and proddin'!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am attempting to determine the best course of action, but I require information. Subcutaneous fat is the fat just under the skin. And regarding "fixing it," it's complicated. Given your BMI and degree of skin laxity, cosmetic procedures alone may not be the most appropriate option. We need to address the underlying causes of your weight loss and muscle atrophy. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel.
PATIENT: Blood work?! Now you want to take my blood?! This is gettin' ridiculous! I came here to fix how I look, not get poked and prodded and have you run a whole bunch of tests! I'm seventy-six years old! I've lived a long life! I don't need blood work! . I'm done. Just give me somethin' for my belly, or forget it. I'm wastin' my time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot ethically provide treatment without a proper evaluation. Given your concerns and the physical findings, it is essential to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your weight loss and muscle atrophy. I strongly recommend the blood work. If you refuse, I can refer you to a cosmetic surgeon, but they will likely require a similar evaluation before proceeding with any procedures. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I advise you to consider the risks of proceeding without a thorough assessment.
