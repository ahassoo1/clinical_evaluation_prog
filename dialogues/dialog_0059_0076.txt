DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda…hard, you know? And painful. Especially when I touch them. I just wanted to get them checked out.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Aluia. Red, hard bumps on your shins that are painful to the touch. I understand. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's been… maybe a month or so? They started small, just a little itchy, and I didn’t really pay much attention. But then they got bigger and more painful. It’s been getting worse lately, that’s for sure. I'm not sure what I did to cause them, though. I've been doing my usual work… moving boxes and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they've been developing over about a month, starting small and itchy, and gradually becoming larger and more painful. And you've noticed it's been worsening recently, despite no specific injury that you recall?
PATIENT: That's right. No injury, no nothin'. Just slowly got worse. My wife, Elena, she noticed them too and told me I should probably get 'em looked at. She's always telling me to go to the doctor, haha. But yeah, no, I didn’t bump into anything or anything like that. Just…appeared.
DOCTOR: It's good of Elena to encourage you to come in – it's always helpful to have someone looking out for us. And no recent trauma or changes in activity – that’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. They don’t really itch much anymore, it’s more just… pain when I press on them. And maybe… my legs feel a little tired, but I do a lot of walking at work so that’s normal, right? I don't know if that’s connected or not. Just tired legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, the itching has subsided, primarily experiencing pain with pressure, and some leg fatigue which you attribute to your work. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Well, I’m 71, so I’ve got a few things, haha. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And my knees… they bother me sometimes, arthritis, you know? Other than that… not much, really. I had the flu a couple of times, but nothing major. I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis in your knees. That’s good to know. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Do you take any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… uh… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really bad. It’s just over-the-counter stuff, ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes a little something for sleeping, just when I can't get to sleep. But that’s it, really. Nothing regular. Just when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and something to help with sleep occasionally. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always makes sure when she buys new food, checks the labels and all. She’s very careful. But no, I don't think I have any allergies. Nope.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Aluia. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to take a look at those bumps on your shins, if you don't mind. Could you please sit up a bit and lift your pants legs so I can examine them?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, Doctor. No problem. Here you go. They’re kinda ugly, huh? They're more noticeable on this leg, I think. Be careful, they’re a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There are multiple raised, reddish-brown nodules on your anterior shins, appearing more prominent on the right leg as you mentioned. They range in size from approximately 0.5 to 1.5 centimeters. They are firm to the touch, and you are right, they elicit some tenderness upon palpation. No warmth or drainage observed at this time. Skin surrounding the nodules appears normal, without any signs of infection. Based on the appearance and your description, these could be several things, including a form of dermatitis or possibly some vascular issue. To get a clearer understanding, I would like to order a few simple tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Uh… well, I don’t really like going for tests, but if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then okay. Whatever you think is best. What kind of tests are we talking about? Nothing too scary, I hope? My wife will be worried if I get a lot of tests done.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Aluia. I wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. In this case, I’d like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection, and a lower extremity venous ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs and see if there's any evidence of vascular insufficiency. These are both non-invasive tests. The CBC is just a simple blood draw, and the ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your legs – it doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. We can schedule these tests at the clinic’s lab. It should only take about an hour or so. Would that be convenient for you?
PATIENT: An hour, huh? Yeah, I guess that’s not so bad. No needles… that’s good. And it’s just sound waves… okay. So, just a blood draw and… the sound thing? Alright. Let's go ahead and schedule those tests then. Can we do it tomorrow? I have a little bit of free time in the morning. If that works. My wife can drive me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tomorrow morning sounds perfectly fine. Let me check the availability... Yes, we can schedule you for a CBC and lower extremity venous ultrasound tomorrow at 9:00 AM. The lab is just down the hall here in the clinic, and the technician will guide you through everything. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for either test. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound good to you, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… manageable. 9:00 AM is fine. No special preparation… good. And a follow-up appointment… okay. Just let me know when you want me to come back. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re getting this checked out. I appreciate you not rushing things. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. We'll get those tests done and take it from there. My staff will be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, redness, swelling, or fever, please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Have a good rest of your day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
