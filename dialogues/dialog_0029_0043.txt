DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, you know? Feels like… a dull ache, mostly. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache in the back of your head. And you said "a little while now"—can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe three weeks ago? At first, it wasn’t so bad, just at the end of the day. Now it's pretty much constant, though some days are better than others. It doesn't feel like a normal headache, if that makes sense. Not a pounding one, more of a… pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks, starting as end-of-day and now more constant with pressure… Okay. And would you say anything makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Lying down seems to help a little. Not completely, but it takes the edge off. And… bright lights don’t help, that's for sure. Makes it feel sharper. I’ve been trying to stay out of the sun, actually. Oh, and stress… when I'm really worried about something with finances, it definitely gets worse. I'm a financial advisor, so things get… hectic sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying down provides some relief, bright lights worsen it, and stress exacerbates it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… No dizziness, thankfully. And no blurry vision. Sometimes, if I’m really straining to see something up close, my eyes feel a bit tired, but I wear glasses, so that’s not new. Oh! And sometimes my neck feels a little stiff on the right side, but I thought that was just from sleeping wrong. It doesn’t always happen with the headache, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or blurry vision, eye strain consistent with glasses use, and intermittent neck stiffness on the right side. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox… nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out when I was in my fifties, but that was over twenty years ago and I recovered just fine. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just an occasional pain reliever for aches and pains, but nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, so childhood illnesses, gallbladder removal over 20 years ago, and no current medications. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, been around cats and dogs, never had a reaction. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach, but… well, we’re divorced now. But seriously, no known allergies. I can take penicillin and all that without any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his heart later in life. But that's about it, really. My siblings are all pretty healthy, as far as I know. No one in my family ever had really bad headaches, not like this anyway. My aunt, she got migraines sometimes, but these don’t feel like migraines. They’re…different. More of a constant ache, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, decades. Not my thing. And recreational drugs? Definitely not. I'm a pretty quiet guy, mostly just work and try to stay healthy. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back isn't what it used to be. So mostly just work these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, looking in your eyes and ears, feeling your neck… Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I appreciate you taking a look. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. No obvious swelling of the optic disc. Ears are clear. Now, your neck is a little tender on the right side, just as you mentioned. No swollen lymph nodes. I'm going to check your range of motion. There's a bit of stiffness and discomfort with range of motion, especially rotating your head to the right. And I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Strength appears normal as well in your arms and legs. Okay. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… normal, I guess? I mean, I knew my neck was a little stiff. Just figured it was from sleeping wrong. The blood pressure being a little high doesn’t surprise me, though. I do worry a lot about my clients' finances, you know? It can be stressful. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's difficult to say definitively at this point. The headache itself, the tenderness in your neck, and the stress you’re under are all contributing factors. The elevated blood pressure needs to be monitored as well. It could be a tension headache, which is very common and often related to stress. However, given the persistence of the headache and the slight neck stiffness, I also want to rule out other possibilities. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a CT scan of your head to rule out anything more serious. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. We can also check your blood to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds a bit scary, Doctor. Is it something you think I really need? I mean, I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that, but is it likely to show anything bad? I’m just a bit worried about radiation and all that. And blood work is fine, though. That doesn’t bother me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel. It is true that a CT scan involves radiation, but the amount is relatively small, and we always weigh the risks and benefits. In your case, given the duration of the headache and the persistent neck stiffness, I want to rule out any structural problems – something pressing on your brain, for example. It’s unlikely to show anything serious, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. We can discuss alternative imaging options, such as an MRI, which doesn’t use radiation, but it takes longer and is more expensive, and access can be limited. For now, let’s start with the blood work. We'll get a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. If the blood work is normal, and you’re still experiencing the headache, we can proceed with the CT scan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Blood work first, and then if it’s all normal, we talk about the CT scan. Yes, that makes me feel better. And you really think it’s probably just stress? I do worry a lot about my clients. It's a tough business these days. Alright, let’s get the blood work done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel. Yes, it’s very possible that this is tension headache related to stress. It’s a very common cause. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The nurse will draw your blood. Once the results are back, usually within 24 to 48 hours, we’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it’s just stress, like you said. I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel. You’re very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope it is just stress as well. Take care.
