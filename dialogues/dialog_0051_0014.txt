DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… right. It’s about some papers, I think. Something to do with work… and being… away from it for a bit. My wife, Leilani, she said I needed to come get something signed. FMLA, was it? Or… disability? Honestly, it all gets a bit muddled. It’s about needing time off, that much I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, understandable. It can be a lot to keep track of. So, you're needing time off from work, and your wife suggested looking into FMLA or disability?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Leilani is very good at… organizing things. I'm the… well, I handle the spiritual side of things, you see. Directors, Religious Activities and Education – that’s my job. But paperwork… not so much my strength. I've been feeling… not quite myself lately. Tired, mostly. And a bit… fuzzy-headed. It’s making it hard to concentrate, which isn’t good when you’re leading services, you know? So, time off seemed like the best idea. But I don't really know what kind of paperwork I need, or even exactly why I need it. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms – fatigue and difficulty concentrating – that are impacting your ability to work. And you're looking to explore options for time off. We can certainly sort that out. Let's start with the fatigue and the “fuzzy-headedness.” Could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did they start… That's a good question. It feels like it’s been a few months, maybe? It came on gradually, not all at once. I used to be able to just… know things, you know? Prepare a sermon without a lot of notes, remember faces easily… Now, I find myself writing everything down. And even then, sometimes the words just… won't come. It’s frustrating. I’ve been trying to push through it, but Leilani said I needed to take care of myself. She worries, you see. Always has.
DOCTOR: It's good that Leilani is looking out for you. And it's admirable that you were trying to push through it. It's common to want to keep going, but sometimes it's important to recognize when you need to slow down. So, a gradual onset of fatigue and difficulty with concentration over the past few months. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Not really. I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major. My appetite's been… normal. No aches or pains. Just… a general feeling of being… slow. Like my brain is wading through mud. And… oh! I’ve been a bit more irritable, I suppose. Snapping at Leilani, which I feel terrible about. She says I just seem… distracted.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, no changes in sleep or appetite, but you've noticed some increased irritability and a feeling of being "slow" or distracted. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I don’t think so. Leilani does most of the cooking, and I just eat what she puts in front of me. She's very good at making sure I get a balanced diet. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that’s what you mean. I'm a tall fella, you see – always been pretty thin, but not… wasting away or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no intentional weight changes. And it’s good to hear Leilani ensures you have a balanced diet. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. I'm not very good with remembering things like that. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. Never had any major illnesses, not that I recall. I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. I see Dr. Akana for my yearly check-ups, but she hasn’t mentioned anything serious. I think she checks my blood pressure and… listens to my heart, you know? The usual.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy, and that you see Dr. Akana regularly. It's okay if you don't remember specifics; we can always access your records if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, but that was a long time ago. Hospitalized… not that I remember. I try to stay away from hospitals if I can. Leilani always said I was a tough Tahitian! She’s very proud of my heritage, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No surgeries or hospitalizations to recall. Now, a quick question about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another tough one. My parents… they both lived long lives, but I don’t really remember them having any serious health problems. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her arthritis when she got older, but that’s about it. And my father… he was always very strong, very healthy. I think he just… wore out eventually. We didn’t really talk much about medical things, you see. It wasn’t really our way. Leilani’s family… she has a cousin with diabetes, I think. But that’s all I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No major medical history on your side, and a cousin of Leilani's with diabetes. Now, just a few more questions, then we can move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I eat pretty much anything. Leilani makes a wonderful poisson cru, you know? And she uses all sorts of different spices. I've never had any reactions, thankfully. No allergies to medications either. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, really. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, I suppose. I am a bit sensitive to the sun, though. Burns easily. But that’s not really an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, sensitivity to the sun isn’t typically considered an allergy. Okay, good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to just… let my body do its own healing, you see. Leilani always says I’m a bit too stubborn to take medicine. I take a bit of coconut oil sometimes, for my skin. But that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. Except… oh! I do take a little bit of noni juice sometimes. Leilani says it’s good for my health. But that’s really all. A very small amount, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small amount of noni juice, and coconut oil for your skin. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not as young as I used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lower lungs. It’s subtle, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your balance is slightly off, but nothing too concerning at this point. Everything seems relatively normal overall, but the elevated blood pressure, mild crackling in your lungs, and slightly diminished reflexes suggest we should do some further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation… Hmm. That doesn't sound too good. What kind of investigation? Is it serious? I'm not afraid of a little discomfort, you see, but I do worry about… well, about not being able to handle things. I have my services to lead, you know. And Leilani… she depends on me. What do you think is going on, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco, and it’s good that you’re proactive about your health. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but these findings warrant a little more investigation to understand what’s going on. The mild crackling in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, which can be caused by a number of things – even a simple infection. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to manage, and the slightly diminished reflexes could be related to that or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, kidney function, and rule out any infection. I also recommend a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray… yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Will it take long? And will it be painful? Leilani can drive me, thankfully. She’s very good at taking care of things. Will the results take long to come back? I have a service next Sunday, you see, and I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The blood work and X-ray shouldn't take long at all. The blood draw will just be a quick prick of the needle – a little discomfort, but it’s over quickly. The X-ray is painless – you’ll just stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and develop a plan. We can certainly aim to have the results back before your service next Sunday. I’ll have my nurse draw up the lab orders and give you a referral for the chest X-ray. Do you have any questions about the process?
PATIENT: No, I think that sounds alright, Doctor. 2-3 business days… that should give us time. And before my service… that's good news. My nurse will draw up the orders, you say? Excellent. I always appreciate a good nurse. They’re the real heroes, you know. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm glad I could help. My nurse, Leilani, will be in shortly to go over the orders with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate your kindness and your patience. Leilani is always telling me I need to take better care of myself, and maybe this is just what I needed. I’ll try to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids, like you said. And I’ll be sure to tell Leilani you were very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself.
