DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing, but… well, my mouth feels quite uncomfortable. It’s a white coating, mostly on my tongue, and it’s rather… unpleasant. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A white coating… on your tongue, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s not… normal, is it? And it’s not going away. I’ve tried… rinsing with water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It’s particularly bad in the mornings, makes it difficult to even taste my coffee. A proper man shouldn’t have to worry about such things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a white coating can be a number of things. It's not necessarily something a "proper man" shouldn't be concerned about; everyone gets things like this from time to time. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Just the coating. Perhaps a little… soreness. It’s hard to say, honestly. I don’t usually pay much attention to such… delicate matters. I assure you, I'm a very busy man and this is taking up valuable time. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: "Soreness" is a bit vague. Is it a burning sensation?
PATIENT: No, not burning. More like… irritated. Rough, perhaps. It’s not painful, exactly. Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I’m not a medical professional. I can’t describe it with precision. I just want something to make it go away. It's probably nothing serious. I've always been a strong, healthy man.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look. Please open your mouth for me. I need to examine your tongue. And please, try to refrain from talking while I'm looking. It's difficult to get an accurate assessment with commentary.
PATIENT: …Fine. But hurry, please. I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon. It's quite important.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is a rather significant coating, as you described. It appears… slightly raised in some areas. No obvious lesions. Have you been using any new mouthwashes, toothpastes, or sprays recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. I’ve been using the same things for years. A simple, reliable brand. No fancy flavors or anything. Honestly, I don’t understand why this is happening. It’s probably just stress. I’ve had a lot on my plate lately. Are you sure this isn’t something that will clear up on its own? I really don't have time for… treatments.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute, yes. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Given the coating's appearance and persistence, it could be oral thrush, a fungal infection. Or, less likely, something else entirely. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite robust, as I said. I eat everything. I don’t coddle myself with special diets or anything like that. It’s probably nothing serious, Doctor. Really. Look, can’t you just give me something to rinse with? A strong antiseptic, perhaps? I assure you, I'm not one for lengthy investigations.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, while I appreciate your… resilience, simply prescribing something without a proper assessment isn’t good practice. We need to determine the cause of the coating before we can recommend treatment. Do you smoke, or consume alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Socially, of course. A good glass of wine with dinner. As for smoking… I used to, years ago. Quit when I married, my wife dislikes it. But it was a long time ago. And frankly, I doubt that’s relevant. I’ve been perfectly healthy since then. This is getting ridiculous, Doctor. I’m a practical man; I need a solution, not a life story interrogation. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Given your… history, and the fact that you are uninsured, I'm going to recommend a simple course of action for now. I’m going to suggest an anti-fungal mouthwash, Nystatin, to use twice daily for one week. If it doesn't improve within that time, you must return for a more thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. A mouthwash. Fine. Hopefully, that will do the trick. I appreciate you not wasting any more of my time, Doctor. Just one question… is this something contagious? My wife and I… well, we are quite close.
DOCTOR: Oral thrush can be mildly contagious, but usually only through direct contact. Avoid sharing utensils and maintain good hygiene. But frankly, given your robust health, it’s likely not that. I strongly advise you both practice good oral hygiene. And if either of you develop any new symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or fever, seek immediate medical attention. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
