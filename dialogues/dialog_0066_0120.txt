DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, it’s…well, it’s about having a baby. I don’t have time for a lot of…fuss. I just want to make sure everything works before I even try, you know? My husband… well, he passed, and I’m…thinking about it now. Don’t want any surprises later. Is that…understandable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. That’s completely understandable. It's very practical to want to get things checked out beforehand, especially given your circumstances. It takes courage to even consider this, and being prepared is a smart approach. So, to start, have you been trying to conceive at all yet?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I just told you, I’m thinking about it. Thinking! I haven’t…done anything yet. Honestly, it’s a bit…personal to even discuss. I just want to know if there's anything wrong with me, if I need…fixing, before I bother. Is that so hard to grasp?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. You're right to want to get a baseline understanding, and I apologize if I jumped ahead. "Fixing" isn't the right word, of course - we're just looking to see what's going on and if everything is functioning as it should. Okay. To start with, could you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Really? Must we? Look, they happen. Every month. More or less. I honestly don’t pay that much attention. They're…red. And uncomfortable. Is that helpful? I mean, I’ve always been…regular enough. Or I think so. It's not like I keep a calendar or something. I have a life, you know? Is there a questionnaire I can fill out or something? This is… tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is tedious to talk about these things sometimes. A questionnaire would be helpful, actually. Let me grab one for you. But just while I’m doing that, can you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea… fine. Okay, they usually come…around every month. About four or five days, I think. Sometimes a little shorter, sometimes a bit longer. I get cramps, obviously. And…I get a little tired. Is that it? Honestly, I don't remember specifics. It's been…a while since anyone asked me about this. Can we just get to the tests now? The sooner I know, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a starting point. Four to five days, regular cycles… that's good information. And yes, cramps and fatigue are common. Let’s get some tests ordered to get a clearer picture. We’ll start with a basic blood panel to check hormone levels and a general health screening. Then, I’d like to do a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a pelvic exam? Really? Must we? I mean, I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. I really don't enjoy people poking around down there. Can’t you just tell me from the bloodwork? Honestly, the less…intrusive, the better. Is it going to be…painful? Because I have a very low tolerance for… discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Carmaleta. A pelvic exam gives me valuable information that bloodwork simply can’t. It lets me check the health of your uterus, ovaries, and other reproductive organs directly. I’ll do everything I can to make it as comfortable as possible. We can go slowly, and you can let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. It shouldn't be painful, but it can be a little…uncomfortable. It’s very quick. We can start with the bloodwork if you prefer, and then discuss the exam after we get those results. Would that make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes! Bloodwork first, definitely. Let's just get that done. The less…hands-on, the better. Honestly, I'm starting to regret even coming here. I just wanted a simple answer, not a whole…investigation. Can we at least sit somewhere comfortable while we talk about this? This room is…sterile. And frankly, depressing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’re right to want to be comfortable, and I apologize if I’m making you feel rushed or pressured. Let’s head over to the lab and get those blood tests done. Then we can sit in a more comfortable area and discuss the results. I’ll also see if we can adjust the lighting and perhaps get you a blanket while we talk. Is there anything I can do right now to make you more at ease?
PATIENT: A blanket would be nice. And maybe some water? I'm starting to get a headache. Honestly, all this…talking is exhausting. Just… let’s get the bloodwork done quickly. The faster I get this over with, the better. And please, no more personal questions until after I know what’s going on. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A blanket and water are no problem at all. And no more questions until after the bloodwork – you’re completely in control here. Let’s go to the lab. It shouldn't take long, and then we’ll get you settled with some water and a blanket, and we can talk through the next steps at your pace. Just a quick note for the record: patient expressing anxiety and discomfort regarding pelvic exam, requesting bloodwork first. Proceeding at patient’s pace.
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Honestly, this whole experience is…a disaster. I’m starting to think maybe I shouldn’t bother with all this baby stuff. It's clearly more trouble than it’s worth. But…don’t mind me. Just…hurry, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I’m truly sorry if this has been difficult. It's perfectly okay to have doubts, and we can absolutely discuss those at any time. There’s no pressure to proceed with anything you’re not comfortable with. The technician is very skilled and gentle. She’ll just need a small sample, and it will be over quickly. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Just…get it over with. And don’t let her poke me too many times. I hate needles. Honestly, I think I'm going to faint. I really need that water now. And a chair…this stool is awful. My back is killing me. Is there anything comfortable in this entire place? This is…torture. .
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Deep breaths. You’re doing great. Just look away if you need to. Here, let's get you sitting in this. And I’ll get you that water right away. Just focus on your breathing. You're doing so well, and it will be over in just a moment. I'm right here.
