DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I am Dr. Yackey. Let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Concise is good. My back...it’s been botherin' me a good while now. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, you know? It’s lower down, right in my back. Been goin’ on for months, I think. Maybe six months, somethin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Six months, you say. And this is…lower back?
PATIENT: Yes, lower back. Right at the small of my back. It’s worse when I stand for too long, or if I try to lift somethin’. Not heavy stuff, mind you. Just…normal things. Groceries, things like that. Sometimes it feels stiff in the mornin’, too. Like I need to stretch it out real good.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you attempted any…self-treatment?
PATIENT: Self-treatment? Well, I try to take it easy. I don't push myself too hard. My daughter, bless her heart, she told me to try some heat. A warm bath mostly. That helps a little, for a bit. And I’ve been tryin’ to sit straighter, you know? But it doesn’t really fix it. I don’t know if that counts as treatment. I haven’t taken any pills or nothin’. I don't like takin' pills.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any…radiating pain?
PATIENT: Radiating pain? You mean…does it go anywhere else? Hmm…sometimes, when it’s really bad, I feel a little bit of it down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, just…in the back of my leg. More on this side. <points to right side> But that doesn't happen all the time. Mostly when I bend over, or twist too quick. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right leg, intermittently. Do you have any numbness or weakness in either leg?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And not weakness, either. I can walk just fine. Climb the stairs, everything. It just…aches. And like I said, that heat helps a little, but it comes back. It’s just…nagging, you know? It's always there, kinda. A dull ache. It doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, but it makes ‘em harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any prior back problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not really. I mean, I’ve pulled a muscle here and there over the years, workin’ in the garden, things like that. But nothin’ serious. Nothin’ that needed a doctor, or anything. Just a little sore for a few days, then it went away. This is different. It’s been goin’ on so long now. And it doesn’t seem to be gettin’ better. That’s what worries me.
DOCTOR: Do you have a family history of…arthritis or spinal issues?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it…my mother, bless her soul, she had some trouble with her back when she got older. Real bad trouble. She had to use a cane for a while. I don't know exactly what it was, somethin' with her bones, I think. And my sister, she had some problems with her hips, arthritis, I believe. On her side of the family, they had more of that. But me…never had nothin’ like that before this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look. Please lie down on the table for me. I need to assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <starts to slowly get up from the chair, wincing slightly> Range of motion, you say? Alright, alright. <walks slowly towards the examination table and carefully lies down on it> Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Old bones ain't as bendy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I’m going to gently feel along your spine…and I’ll need you to try to touch your toes, if you can. Just go as far as is comfortable. Hmm. Tenderness present upon palpation of the lumbar spine, particularly L4-L5. Limited range of motion, especially flexion. No obvious muscle spasm noted. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally in lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That felt a little tender, yes. Especially when you pressed right there. <points to lower back> And bendin' over…that’s the hard part. I can’t get down very far anymore. Never could touch my toes even when I was young, but now…it's even harder. So, what does that mean? Is it my mother’s trouble? Is somethin' broken? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Based on the examination, it appears you have lumbar strain, likely exacerbated by age-related degenerative changes. It’s unlikely to be a fracture, based on your description and the absence of acute neurological deficits. However, without imaging, we cannot definitively rule out other causes. I recommend a course of physical therapy and over-the-counter pain management. If symptoms worsen or do not improve within four weeks, we can discuss further imaging options. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain…degenerative changes… <frowns, looking confused> So, it’s just…old age? That’s what’s causin’ it? Physical therapy…that sounds good. I’ve heard good things about that. Over-the-counter pain management…like what? Pills? I don’t really like takin’ pills, Doctor. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe somethin’ to strengthen my back? And four weeks…if it doesn’t get better, then what? X-rays? Is that what you mean by ‘imaging’? I just want to know what’s goin’ on, and what I can do to feel better.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vankampen, X-rays would be the next step if symptoms persist. Over-the-counter options include ibuprofen or naproxen, as tolerated. Physical therapy will focus on strengthening core muscles and improving flexibility. I can provide a referral to a local clinic. As for additional measures…maintain a healthy weight, practice proper lifting techniques, and avoid prolonged sitting. I understand your reluctance regarding medication, but these are relatively mild options. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any. Okay, healthy weight…I try to eat good, but I do like my sweets, I confess. Proper liftin’…that’s a good idea. I tend to bend my back too much when I lift somethin’. I'll try to remember that. Bend my knees, right? And physical therapy…alright, I'll give it a try. You said four weeks? And then we talk about the X-rays? Is there somethin’ wrong with my bones, you think? My mother…she had terrible trouble with her bones. <looks worried> Is it like that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, I understand your concerns, but I cannot definitively diagnose you without further investigation. The X-rays will help determine if there are any structural abnormalities. I want to reassure you that most cases of lumbar strain resolve with conservative management. However, it is prudent to rule out other potential causes, especially given your family history. I’ll write you a referral to physical therapy and a prescription for ibuprofen. If your pain worsens, or you experience numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Numbness, tingling, weakness…okay, I'll watch for that. No, I don't think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ it to me. And for the referral and the prescription. I hope the physical therapy helps. It's just…worryin', you know? About my bones. My mother… <trails off, looking down> But alright. I'll try the therapy. And I'll watch for those symptoms. Thank you again, Doctor Yackey. I appreciate it. <slowly starts to get up from the examination table>
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Vankampen. Follow up with the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
