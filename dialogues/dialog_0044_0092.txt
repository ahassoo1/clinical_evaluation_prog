DOCTOR: Good morning, Oreste. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Asami, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… short of breath. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, ya know? And my eyes... like sand paper. That's what it feels like. Don't remember when it started, exactly. Just... happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, a dry mouth, and eyes that feel like sandpaper. I understand. And you said you don't recall exactly when this started, just that it developed gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, yeah. Not like I woke up one day gasping for air. Just… more and more difficult. Used to be able to walk to the store, no problem. Now… gotta stop twice, maybe three times. Old age, I guess. Though I ain't that old. Eighty-three is just a number, right?
DOCTOR: Eighty-three is just a number, Oreste. It's good you're noticing the changes and coming in to get it checked out. It's certainly possible that this is simply age-related, but we want to rule out anything else that could be contributing. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Contributing? What's to contribute? I told ya, old age! But… alright, alright. It’s worse when I… well, when I do something. Walkin’, like I said. Even just gettin' dressed sometimes. Feels like I'm breathin’ through a straw. Not all the time, though. When I'm sittin’… watchin’ the game… mostly okay. Though even then… sometimes I gotta take a deep breath. It's nothin’ much. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exertion-related, and it seems to happen even at rest sometimes. And you said you’ve noticed a dry mouth and sandy eyes as well. Let’s talk about those a bit. Is the dry mouth constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm sleepin', I think. Wake up with my tongue feelin’ like… well, like a piece of wood. Gotta drink a whole glass of water just to get things movin’. Though it happens during the day too, sometimes. Not as bad. And the eyes… always feel a little gritty. Like I been rubbin' 'em with sugar. I don’t rub ‘em with sugar, mind you. Just makin’ a point.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant gritty eyes and a dry mouth that's worse at night, but present during the day too. That’s helpful. Now, let’s go through a bit more of your history, if you don't mind. Have you had any other medical problems in the past, like heart trouble, lung issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart trouble? Nah. Never had a problem with my heart. Strong as a bull, always was. Lung issues... I smoked a few cigarettes when I was young, back in Cuba. Everyone did. But I quit… oh, must be fifty years ago. Diabetes? Never. I like sweets, sure, but never been told I had that problem. Though my mother... she had somethin’. Sugar problem, I think. A long time ago. She lived to be ninety, though. So, what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, no heart trouble, you quit smoking a long time ago, and no personal history of diabetes. Your mother had a sugar problem, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, somethin' like that. Sugar… or somethin'. She had to watch what she ate, always takin’ pills. I don't remember the details. Long time ago. She lived in Cuba, you know? Everything was different then. It wasn't easy. But she was a strong woman. Anyway... what are we talkin’ about again? You askin' about my mother for?
DOCTOR: We're talking about your medical history, Oreste, and family history. Knowing what your mother had can sometimes help us understand what might be going on with you. But don’t worry, we can circle back to it if you'd prefer. Let's get back to you for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. When I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin' outta a tree. Chasin' a mango, if you can believe it. Had to get a cast. That's it, I think. No surgeries. Never had to cut me open or nothin'. Still got all my original parts, mostly. At least, I think I do. It's hard to keep track at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, you broke your arm as a young man, but no surgeries. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Doc gave me somethin' for my blood pressure a few years back. Stopped takin’ it, though. Didn't feel right. Gave me a headache. Besides that… sometimes I take a little somethin' for my arthritis, when it’s real bad. But just the over-the-counter stuff. You know, the kind they sell at the drugstore. Ibuprofen, or somethin'. Nothin’ fancy. Mostly I just try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to take medication for blood pressure but stopped due to headaches, and you occasionally take over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never been allergic to nothin’. I eat everything. Cuban food, American food, everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that's just from the sun, ya know? I spend a lot of time outside. I'm a tough old bird. Nothin' bothers me much. Well, except maybe these headaches. From that blood pressure pill, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What's to tell? I live alone. Watch a lot of baseball. Try to stay outta the heat. Mostly I just… exist. I used to be a traffic technician, back in the day. Fixed the lights, ya know? Now I'm retired. Not much excitement. Though I used to like to dance, back in Cuba. Before… things changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, enjoy watching baseball, and are retired after working as a traffic technician. You used to enjoy dancing. That's helpful to know. Now, do you smoke currently or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: I told ya, I used to smoke. A long time ago. Back in Cuba. Everyone smoked! Cigarettes, cigars… didn’t matter. But I quit, like, fifty years ago. Haven't touched one since. Bad for ya, ya know? Though sometimes I smell 'em on the street... makes me kinda nostalgic, I guess. But no. I don’t smoke. Never did after I quit.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You quit smoking fifty years ago and haven’t touched one since. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little. Sometimes I have a glass of wine with dinner. Just a small one. Red wine, usually. Good for the heart, I hear. Not every night, though. Mostly on the weekends. I'm not a big drinker. Just a little somethin' to relax. It's gotta be good Cuban wine, though. Can't drink that American stuff. It's no good.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a small glass of red wine occasionally, mostly on weekends. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Oreste, thank you for answering all my questions. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to check things out a bit closer, if that's okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and eyes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Check whatever you gotta check. Just don't poke me too much. Old skin, ya know? Tears easy. And don't take too long, Doc. I got a baseball game to watch. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart. Take a nice deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but it's not overly concerning given your anxiety about the exam, potentially. I'm hearing a normal rhythm, no murmurs at this time. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Again, take nice, deep breaths. I hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs. It’s faint, but present. It could be due to mild asthma or simply some narrowing of the airways. Now I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little high, 145/90. It's good you stopped that medication, then, if it was causing headaches. Finally, I'll take a quick look at your throat and eyes. Your throat is a little red, and your eyes are indeed dry, as you mentioned. I notice some injection as well. Okay, everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things I want to investigate further. Your elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, and dry eyes are things we need to address.
PATIENT: Wheezing? What's wheezing? Sounds bad. And my blood pressure's high? I eat good Cuban food, I tell ya! Lots of rice and beans. Shouldn't be high. You young doctors… always somethin' wrong. What are ya gonna do about it, then? Give me a pill? I don’t want no pills. Just fix what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, Oreste. It indicates that your airways are a little narrow, which could be from a number of things – allergies, asthma, or even just age-related changes. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s something we want to look into. And I understand your concern about the blood pressure. Cuban food is delicious, but it can sometimes be high in sodium, which can contribute to elevated blood pressure. I'm not going to rush to give you a pill, I promise. We can try some lifestyle changes first. We can discuss lowering your sodium intake, and I'd like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want to order a complete blood count to rule out infection, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a chest X-ray to get a closer look at your lungs. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And how long are these tests gonna take? I got the game on. And what if they find somethin' bad? Are ya gonna send me to the hospital? I ain’t goin’ to no hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Oreste. I’ll try to make this as quick and painless as possible. The blood tests will only take a few minutes, and the chest X-ray will be even faster. We can get them done here in the clinic today. As for finding something bad, that’s unlikely. But it's always better to be safe than sorry. These tests will help us rule out anything serious and give us a clearer picture of your health. If we do find something that needs further attention, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and come up with a plan together. I promise, I won't send you to the hospital unless it’s absolutely necessary. Let's get these tests done, and then we can talk about some simple changes you can make to improve your health. How about we start with that?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. But no pokin’ my arm too much. And make sure that nurse is gentle. I don't like needles. And tell me when it’s done. I don’t wanna sit here all day. Just get it over with, Doc.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Oreste. I’ll personally let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible, and I’ll be right here with you during the blood draw. I'll stay with you until it's done. Let’s head over to the lab. It won't take long. The nurse is already expecting us. I will also be back in a moment with the order for your chest x-ray. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Fine. Let's go. But if that needle hurts, I'm holdin' you responsible, Doc. Don’t go too fast, ya hear? Old legs, ya know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Oreste. We'll take it slow. I'll walk right beside you. And I promise, I’ll do everything I can to make this as comfortable as possible. Just take a deep breath, and it will be over before you know it. So, who are you rooting for today?
PATIENT: The Yankees, of course! Who else? Best team in the league. Always have been, always will be. Don't tell me you're a Red Sox fan, Doc? I'll walk right outta here. Though they haven’t been playin’ too well lately… still, they'll pull through. Always do. Hurry up now, let’s get this over with. My game's gonna start soon.
DOCTOR: The Yankees, a classic choice! I'm not much of a baseball fan myself, so I don’t have a team to root for, thankfully. That way, I can’t offend anyone. Here we are. Let me just let the nurse know you're here, and she’ll be with us in a moment. Hi, Maria. This is Oreste. He’s a little nervous about the blood draw, so if you could be extra gentle, I’d appreciate it. She's very good, Oreste. You're in good hands. Just relax, take a few deep breaths, and it’ll be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Hmph. Good hands, you say? I'll believe it when I see it. I don't like needles. Never have, never will. Just get it over with quickly, that’s all I ask. And don't poke me too much. Old skin tears easy, you know. Hurry up now. The game's gonna start.
DOCTOR: Okay, Oreste. Just focus on your breathing. Deep breaths in… and out… The nurse is very experienced and will be as quick and gentle as possible. Maria, could you please explain the procedure to Oreste and reassure him that it will be quick and as painless as possible?
PATIENT: Painless… yeah, right. They all say that. Just get it over with already. Don't talk to me, just poke me and be done with it. The game is starting soon… hurry up!
DOCTOR: Maria: "Of course, doctor. Hello Oreste, my name is Maria. I understand you're a little nervous about the blood draw. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I just need to clean your arm with an alcohol wipe, and then use a needle to draw a small amount of blood into these tubes. It will only take a few minutes, and I'll be right here with you the whole time. You can look away if you prefer. Deep breaths, and it will be over before you know it." "Just focus on your breathing, Oreste. I'm right here with you. You're doing great."
PATIENT: Just get it over with… quickly… quickly… Ouch… that hurts! Hurry… hurry… get it over with…
DOCTOR: “You’re doing great, Oreste. Just a little bit more… almost finished… You’re very brave.” Maria: "Almost done, Oreste. Just a few more seconds..." Maria: "All finished, Oreste. Just apply pressure to this cotton ball for a few minutes to stop the bleeding.” “See?
PATIENT: Finally… over… That hurt… a lot… I told you so… needles are awful… Can I go now? The game is probably starting…
DOCTOR: “I know, Oreste. Needles are never pleasant. You were very brave, though. And yes, you can absolutely go now. Let’s just make sure the bleeding has stopped.” “Looks good. Just keep that bandage on for a little while to avoid any irritation.” “I’ll go ahead and order your chest X-ray. It shouldn’t take long. Then we can discuss the results of these blood tests and come up with a plan together.” “Thank you, Maria. You were wonderful.” “Let’s head over to the X-ray room. I hope you enjoy the game.”
PATIENT: Fine… let’s get it over with… The Yankees better be winning… Hurry up now… my game… Just get it over with… quickly…
DOCTOR: “Of course. Let’s go. The X-ray room is just down the hall. It won’t take long at all. Just a quick picture, and then you can get back to enjoying the game.” “Are you a lifelong Yankees fan, Oreste?
