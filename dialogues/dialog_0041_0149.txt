DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Pol-chin-ski, is it? Fancy name. Well, honestly? I don't rightly know why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed a check-up. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Don't need anyone poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Polczynski, yes, it's a bit of a mouthful! That's alright, Wynell. It's very common for daughters to worry, and a check-up is always a good idea, even if you're feeling well. It's just to make sure everything is alright. I see here you're 83 years young. And your daughter mentioned you live out in the country?
PATIENT: Country living, yes. Been there nearly… oh, goodness, sixty years now. Long enough. It's quiet, which is nice, but things are… different these days. Not like when I was a girl. And eighty-three… feels younger, truthfully. Though my bones do ache a bit in the cold. Now, are you going to ask me about my feet? That’s what they always ask, being a… a foot doctor and all. I’ve always taken care of them, mind you. Always.
DOCTOR: Sixty years, wow! That’s a long time to call a place home. And I understand about things changing – it happens. And no, I’m not just a foot doctor, Wynell. I specialize in internal medicine – so, checking overall health. But you're right to mention the aches – that's good information. You said they bother you in the cold?
PATIENT: Internal medicine, you say? Fancy. Not what I expected. Seems like a waste of a good foot doctor, if you don't mind me saying so. Yes, the aches. Mostly in my ankles and… well, the arches, I suppose. But only when it's damp and chilly. Florida cold, you understand. It's not real cold. Just… persistent. It's nothing to worry about, I'm sure. It's just old age creeping in. I've always been strong, though. Always on my feet. A podiatrist has to be, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. And it's good to know you were a podiatrist! That explains your good foot care – and your awareness of aches and pains. It's good you're so observant. "Persistent" is a good way to put it. And Florida cold can still be bothersome. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet along with the aches?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… Now that you mention it… sometimes, after a long day, my ankles do feel a bit… puffy. Not terribly so. Just… not as neat as they used to be. I usually just put my feet up and it goes away. My daughter keeps buying me these compression stockings, says it'll help. I don't much care for them, makes my legs feel squeezed. She means well, of course. Always fussing. Is swelling… bad? I haven't had any trouble walking, mind you. Still get around just fine.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're still getting around well, Wynell. And it's not unusual for swelling to happen, especially with changes in weather or after being on your feet. The compression stockings can definitely help, though I understand they aren’t the most comfortable. To rule anything serious out, and just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical problems you might have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're talking about the past. That was a long time ago. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. And… oh, yes, pneumonia once. Nearly did me in, that one. And my blood pressure, the doctor always said it was a little high. But I don’t take any pills for it. Don't believe in filling my body with chemicals. Mostly just try to eat sensible and get my rest. Though resting is harder these days with all the… fussing. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden, but that healed up just fine. Is that all you need to know? My memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Wynell. It’s good you remember those things! And it’s alright if things aren’t perfectly clear – we can take our time. So, gallbladder out, pneumonia, and a history of high blood pressure. And you broke your wrist. Do you have any trouble with your breathing now, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not really. I get a little winded sometimes climbing the stairs, but who doesn't at my age? And chest pain… no. Not unless my daughter starts talking about me moving into one of those… places. Those assisted living places… horrible. I’d rather stay in my own home, even if it’s just me and the memories. Now, are we done? I have a bridge game later this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late. Old Mrs. Henderson gets very competitive.
DOCTOR: No, no, we’re not quite done yet, Wynell. Just a few more questions, and I promise I'll be quick. And I understand about wanting to stay in your own home – that's very important. And I can imagine Mrs. Henderson is quite the player! Alright, just to finish up, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have these fish oil capsules. My daughter says they're good for my brain. And… oh, yes, this glucosamine for my joints. Doctor said it might help with the aches. But honestly, I can't tell if they're doing anything. And sometimes I take a little something for sleep. Just when I’m really restless. But that’s it, mostly. Just a few little things. Nothing serious, I assure you. Do you need to write all those down? Seems like a lot for a few little aches and pains.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know what you’re taking, even if it’s just a few things. Fish oil, glucosamine, and something for sleep. That's very helpful. Now, one last thing, Wynell. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a girl, but that was ages ago. Haven't been stung in years. And no, I don't have any problems with food. I eat just about anything, though I don’t much care for okra. That’s just a personal preference, not an allergy. Now, is that all? I really need to get going if I’m going to make my bridge game on time. Mrs. Henderson doesn't take kindly to tardiness. She’s a formidable opponent, that one. Absolutely formidable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, I think that's everything. No known allergies, which is good. So, to summarize, you've had your gallbladder out, pneumonia, and a history of high blood pressure. You take fish oil, glucosamine, and something for sleep. You experience some ankle and arch aches, particularly in damp weather, with occasional swelling. And you're a former podiatrist! I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, honestly. I suppose so. But don't go poking and prodding too much. I’m an old woman, not a… a science experiment. And please, no cold instruments. My bones are rather sensitive these days. And I still have my bridge game to get to, remember? Mrs. Henderson will be expecting me. She’s ruthless, that one. Absolutely ruthless. But alright, go ahead. Just be gentle, Doctor. Gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I’ll be very gentle. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just relax and take some deep breaths for me. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just lie back comfortably and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Abdomen, you say? Is that where you check for… things? I haven’t been eating anything unusual, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just sensible food, like my mother always made. And please, be careful. I have a delicate constitution, you know. And Mrs. Henderson is expecting me… honestly, I don’t understand what’s taking so long. A quick listen should be enough, shouldn’t it? I have a reputation to uphold at the bridge table. A reputation!
DOCTOR: Just checking for any tenderness or unusual masses, Wynell. Everything feels soft and normal so far. No tenderness at all. Your abdomen is soft and relaxed. Now, I’m just going to check the pulses in your ankles. This will help me assess circulation. Just relax your legs for me. Pulses are present and equal on both sides. A little diminished, which isn’t uncommon with age, but nothing to worry about at this time. Alright, Wynell, that's all I need for now. Everything looks good, overall. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your abdomen is soft, and your pulses are present. As I mentioned, your pulses are a little diminished, which is common with age. And your ankles have some mild swelling, which you've already noticed.
PATIENT: Well, that’s a relief. I knew everything was alright. I always take care of myself. Always have. And I told you about the swelling. It’s nothing to worry about, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I do wish you hadn’t taken so long. Mrs. Henderson is probably already picking her cards. She’s a shark, that one. Absolutely ruthless. So, what’s the verdict? Do I need any… potions or anything? Or can I finally go play my bridge game?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be proactive about your health, Wynell. And you’re also right, it sounds like everything is quite stable. Based on my exam and what you’ve told me, I don’t think you need any “potions” at this time. The mild swelling in your ankles is likely related to age and being on your feet, and the diminished pulses are also common. I recommend continuing to elevate your feet when possible, especially after a long day, and continuing to stay active. If the swelling worsens or you experience any pain, please let me know. I’m going to order some basic blood work just to get a baseline and rule out anything else. It’s just a precautionary measure. And yes, you’re free to go play your bridge game! I wouldn’t want you to miss a hand. Just be sure to call the office if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, honestly. More poking and prodding. But alright, if you insist. As long as it doesn't take too long. And no, I don't think I have any questions. Just… try not to keep too many people waiting next time, Doctor. Time is precious, you know. Especially when there’s bridge to be played. And tell Mrs. Henderson I said hello… though she probably won’t care. She’s too busy winning. Honestly, that woman is terrifying. .
