DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sugino. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you too, Dr. Jules. No problem at all, I understand being busy! Well, I've been thinking… I’d like to learn more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I've heard it can be helpful for… well, just generally feeling calmer, and I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction? I'm not sure where to even start, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness… meditation?
PATIENT: Yes. I keep hearing about it from friends, and reading little bits online. Things feel… a bit much sometimes, you know? Work is okay – I fix signals and track switches, so it's important work, of course – but it can be stressful. And… well, I live alone. So I thought maybe learning to quiet my mind a little would be a good thing. It’s not a… problem problem, if that makes sense. Just something I’m interested in exploring.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you are consulting a physician. I specialize in internal medicine. While I appreciate your… self-exploration, I am not qualified to provide guidance on… stress management techniques. Perhaps a therapist, or a yoga instructor, would be more appropriate. Have you considered those avenues?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, goodness, you’re absolutely right. I am so sorry. I… I got carried away thinking, and I just… assumed. You’re a doctor, of course, and I shouldn’t have expected you to… I completely understand. No, I haven't considered a therapist or yoga instructor yet, to be honest. I hadn't even thought of it like… a medical thing, really. Just something I wanted to try. Would you happen to know if Medicare covers anything like that?
DOCTOR: Medicare coverage… that varies significantly depending on the specifics of your plan, Ms. Sugino. I would advise you to contact Medicare directly, or review your benefits documentation. It’s a rather cumbersome system, I’m afraid. Now, is there anything else medically concerning you today?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. You’re right to ask. No, nothing else pressing, thank you. Just… a bit of a silly request, I suppose. I apologize for taking up your time. I’ll definitely check with Medicare and see what's covered. I really appreciate your patience with me. It's just... I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, and I sometimes struggle to articulate what's going on. I thought maybe if I could learn to calm down a little, it would be easier. But I see now that’s not really your area. So, no, nothing else today. Thank you again, Dr. Jules.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you develop any actual medical symptoms – fever, chest pain, unexplained weight loss – please schedule another appointment immediately. Otherwise, I believe we are finished. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you for seeing me, even though I… didn’t really have a medical problem. And thank you for being honest with me about what you can and can’t help with. I appreciate it. I’ll remember to look out for those symptoms. Have a good day, Dr. Jules.
DOCTOR: Very good. You have a good day as well, Ms. Sugino. And please, do try to be more specific with your concerns during any future appointments. It saves us both time. .
