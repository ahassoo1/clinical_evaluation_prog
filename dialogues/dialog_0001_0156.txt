DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Hi. It’s… been a bit of a rough patch, honestly. I’m not even sure where to start, really. It feels like this has been going on for ages.
DOCTOR: Ages, huh?
PATIENT: Well, not ages ages… but a really long time. Maybe… a few months? I honestly lose track. It’s mostly the… you know, the stomach stuff. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty constant lately. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stomach stuff.” Is it… pain?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. It's not always pain pain, if that makes sense. More like… really bad cramping. And… well, a lot of running to the bathroom. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. Like, constantly. And it’s… watery. A lot. I'm just… tired of it, you know? Do you need me to be more specific? I don't really remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping and… frequent bathroom visits. Watery stools. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Um… not that I can think of. My husband does most of the cooking, and he hasn’t really changed anything. We eat pretty much the same stuff as always, I guess. Rice, chicken, vegetables… normal things. I haven’t tried anything new, and I definitely haven’t been eating anything bad. I don’t think so, anyway. He’d tell me if I was!
DOCTOR: And how about stress?
PATIENT: Stress? Hmm… Work’s been okay, normal sales stuff. Nothing too bad. We’re trying for a baby, so… that’s a little stressful, I guess? But it’s a good kind of stressful, if that makes sense. Not like, work-panic stressful. More like… hoping-everything-goes-right stressful. Does that even count? I just… I don’t know why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get some basics down. Any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t actually been sick, like throwing up. Just… the bathroom stuff. It's more like… emptying out, if that makes sense? And no… I don't think I’ve lost any weight either. My husband says I look the same, but he always says that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to rule things out. Can you lay down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Is… is this something serious, do you think? I mean, I know you can’t tell me everything yet, but… just a general idea? It's just... I've been feeling a little anxious about it, and my husband is at work, so I don't have anyone with me right now.
DOCTOR: Let’s just get the exam done first. Then we can talk. It’s probably nothing, but we need to check. Lie down, and we’ll get this over with. I haven’t got all day.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… let me know if anything feels weird, right? I'm not very good with medical stuff, so… just tell me what you're doing as you go, if that’s okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath… and another one. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, a little. It's… not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. It feels worse when you press… around here. Is that bad? It feels like… pressure, mostly. It’s hard to explain. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Bowel sounds are… active. Okay. Let’s check your reflexes. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay… Is everything okay so far? It just… feels a bit strange, having someone poke around. I’m not used to this. And what are you looking for, exactly? I know you’re the doctor and you know what you’re doing, but… knowing what’s happening would make me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm just doing a basic exam to rule things out. You said cramping and frequent bowel movements. We need to check for tenderness, listen to your gut, that's it. Your reflexes seem normal. Now, let’s take your temperature. Normal.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does all this mean? Is it something I should be worried about? I remember my grandma having… stomach problems. She kept saying something about her insides being all… messed up. Is it like that? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s probably just some mild gastroenteritis. Something you ate. Stay hydrated, bland diet. If it doesn’t clear up in a couple of days, come back. I'll order a stool sample, just to rule out anything serious. But honestly, it's probably nothing.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Okay… But… you said my grandma? And you mentioned it might be serious? I… I have IBD, I think. My mom has it, and I’ve always had stomach issues. I thought maybe this was a flare-up. Or… celiac disease? I saw something about that online. Does that change anything? I just… I’m really worried about this being something more than just something I ate. I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Look, I've barely examined you. Your mom having some condition doesn't automatically mean you have it. It could be a multitude of things. We’ll run the stool sample, and if anything comes back positive, then we'll talk about further testing. Now, do you have any allergies or medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. No allergies, and… I don't really take any medication, except for… vitamins. Just a multivitamin. And… I take iron sometimes, because I get tired easily. But that’s it. Really. And… could you maybe just explain what a stool sample involves? I just… I get a little anxious about these things. I’m sorry for asking so many questions. I just… I want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Here. Instructions on how to collect the sample. Take it to the lab, they’ll handle it from there. Honestly, it’s pretty straightforward. Don’t overthink it. I’m going to write up a note for the lab and be done with this. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you… I guess. .
