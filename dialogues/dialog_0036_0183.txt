DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s… this tiredness. Always tired. Been going on a while now. Doctor said something about my liver, a long time ago. Don't remember much of what he said. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Persistent tiredness can be really disruptive. You mentioned a previous doctor brought up something about your liver. Do you recall roughly when that was, and what kind of tests, if any, were done at that time?
PATIENT: Tests? No. A long time ago. Maybe… ten years? More? I was working more then, different job. Not this… cloth work. He poked around, asked questions. Gave me a paper with numbers. I gave it to my wife. She handles things like that. I just felt… weak. Still feel weak, mostly. Don't remember the name of that doctor either. Old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, we can try to piece things together. So, about ten years ago, a doctor noted something potentially related to your liver based on some tests and a physical exam. You felt weak then, and you're still experiencing that weakness now. To get a better understanding, could you describe what you mean by "weak"?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Not like I can't do things. I go to work, I help around the house. But… everything takes effort. Like walking up the stairs. Or even just… thinking. Everything feels heavy. And I sleep a lot. Still tired when I wake up. It's not a pain, not like that. Just… no energy. Like a battery that’s almost dead. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand exactly what you mean. That sounds incredibly draining. It’s helpful to describe it like a low battery – a constant lack of energy even with adequate rest. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through some general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. My wife makes good food. I don't want to eat much sometimes, but I eat. She worries if I don't. Not much different than before, I guess. Maybe… smaller portions. But I don't feel hungry all the time. It’s not like I’m stuffing myself, but I’m not skipping meals either. She makes injera, mostly. And wat. Good stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so relatively stable appetite, perhaps slightly smaller portions, but generally eating regular meals. That's good to know. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements – anything different in terms of frequency, color, or consistency?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Doctor, you ask a lot of personal questions. Look, I come here because I'm tired. Not… that. But alright. They're… normal. Sometimes a little… loose. But not often. It changes. Everything changes. It's not a big problem. My wife always asks if I'm regular. She worries about everything. Just… normal, mostly. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel personal, Mr. Grumman. It’s important for me to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing your tiredness. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be linked to underlying medical conditions. Okay, so generally normal bowel movements with occasional looseness. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin or the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Skin? Whites of… eyes? What am I supposed to look for? I haven’t been looking at my skin. It’s… brown. Always brown. And my eyes… they look like eyes. I wear glasses. Maybe… a little yellow sometimes? I don’t know. My wife says I look tired. She notices things like that. Is that what you mean? She says my skin looks… dull.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was trying to get at – any changes in skin color or the whites of your eyes. Dull skin or a yellowish tinge can sometimes indicate liver issues, which you mentioned a previous doctor had investigated. I'd like to take a look at your skin and eyes myself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If you need to look, look. I don’t see what looking will do, but… go ahead. Just don’t poke me too much. I don’t like being poked. It reminds me of the old doctor. He poked a lot. And prodded. It was uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman. I’m just going to take a quick listen to your heart and lungs as well. Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I do notice some mild jaundice – a slight yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Given your history of reported fatigue, the previous doctor’s concerns about your liver, and the mild jaundice I'm observing, I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of your liver function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking? Look, I don’t like doctors. I come here because I’m tired, not to be poked and prodded and have my blood taken. But… alright. If you think it’s important. Just… get it over with quickly. And tell me what it means, in plain English. None of that doctor talk. My wife can come with me next time, if it’s too complicated. But I want to go home now. I’m still tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Grumman. I assure you, the blood draw will be as quick and comfortable as possible. It’s a standard procedure and will give us valuable information. The blood tests will help us assess how well your liver is functioning. We'll be looking at several different markers – things like your bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, and albumin levels. High bilirubin can cause the jaundice we’re seeing. Abnormal liver enzymes can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver. And albumin levels can show how well your liver is making proteins. I will explain the results in plain English, I promise. And you are welcome to bring your wife with you next time, absolutely. Let's get the blood draw ordered, and then we can discuss a plan for how to follow up. I'll also write you a note explaining what we've discussed, in case you want to share it with your wife. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A note would be good. My wife likes notes. And just… hurry up with the poking. I want to go home. Is there a chair? I’m getting dizzy. This is too much. Just… get it done. I’ll sit down. But hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, please sit down. And I will certainly expedite things as much as possible. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled and efficient. She'll be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll be right here, and I'll explain each step as it happens. We’ll take things slowly. Just focus on your breathing. It’s a very common procedure, and we’ll get through it together. I’ll also have Maria get you a glass of water. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Water would be good. I’m thirsty. And… tell her to be gentle. I don’t like needles. My wife says I’m a baby, but… I just don’t like being poked. Hurry up, though. The longer I sit here, the more tired I get. Is there anything I can do to make it faster? Close my eyes? Hold my breath? Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Yes, closing your eyes can definitely help. And you don’t need to hold your breath. Just relax your arm as much as possible. The more tense you are, the harder it can be for Maria to find a vein. Maria should be right in. I’ll also remain here with you throughout the process. We can talk about something else to distract you if you'd like - perhaps your work, or your family?
PATIENT: Work… It’s cloth. Cutting and sewing. Not exciting. Mostly just… long hours. My wife worries about my hands. Says I work too hard. She makes good food, though. Wat and injera. And tibs, sometimes. That’s good. She’s a good wife. That’s all that matters. Just… get the poking done. Please.
DOCTOR: Maria: “Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Dr. Bacy mentioned you're a little anxious about the blood draw. We'll take our time and make sure you're comfortable. Is there an arm you prefer?
PATIENT: Left one. It feels… stronger. Not that it matters much. Just… hurry. I don’t like this. And be gentle, like the doctor said. Very gentle. I don’t want to faint. My wife would be upset.
DOCTOR: Maria: "Absolutely. We'll be very gentle. Let's get you positioned comfortably. Dr. Bacy, would you mind helping me distract Mr. Grumman while I get everything set up?
PATIENT: Just… tell me when it’s over. Please. Don’t talk to me. Just… do it. Quickly. I feel… strange. And my stomach feels… empty.
DOCTOR: Maria: "Alright, Mr. Grumman. Just a little pinch now... almost done..." Dr. Bacy: "You're doing great, Mr. Grumman. Just breathe deeply. It's almost over now. Just a few more seconds…" Maria: “All done, Mr. Grumman! You did wonderfully.” Dr. Bacy: "Excellent job, Mr. Grumman. Thank you for being so brave. It looks like you’re a little pale. Let’s get you a glass of water and have you sit here for a few minutes to recover. I’ll review your results as soon as they come in. Do you feel any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizzy… a little. And… my stomach feels… worse. Empty. Very empty. I need to… sit down. And… maybe lie down. I don’t feel good. Can I… go home now? Just… want to lie down. Is the poking over? Really over?
DOCTOR: Dr. Bacy: “Yes, the poking is absolutely over, Mr. Grumman. You did very well, even though it was understandably unpleasant. And it’s perfectly alright to feel weak and shaky afterwards. It’s common. Given your dizziness and stomach discomfort, I think it would be best if you didn’t go home right away. We have a comfortable recliner in the recovery room where you can rest for a little while. I’ll have a nurse bring you some crackers and juice. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Crackers… and juice. Yes. That would be good. And… maybe a blanket? I feel… cold. Very cold. And… can my wife come? She worries about me. She'll be upset if I don't call her. Please… let her come. She makes good wat. I need my wife.
DOCTOR: Dr. Bacy: “Of course, Mr. Grumman. We’ll get you a blanket right away, and I’ll have the nurse call your wife immediately. She can come as soon as possible. We want to make sure you're comfortable and safe. I’ll also check your blood pressure and pulse just to be on the safe side. Then I'll review the blood test results when they come in and we'll discuss a plan. Just relax for now, and let us take care of you.” Dr. Bacy: “Just a few more minutes, Mr. Grumman. Your wife will be here soon.”
PATIENT: Wat… I want wat. And my wife. Please… hurry. Just… want my wife. And warm blanket. And wat. Very hungry. And tired. So tired. Just… let me rest.
DOCTOR: Dr. Bacy: “You’ll get your wat, Mr. Grumman. And your wife is on her way. Just rest now. We’re here with you.” .
