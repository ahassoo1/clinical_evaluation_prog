DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… hard to explain exactly. I just… I have trouble going to the bathroom sometimes. It feels like it doesn’t all come out, you know? Like it's stuck. It’s been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Alright. And when you say “doesn’t all come out,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I strain a bit, push a little, and then… just a dribble. Not a strong stream like it used to be. And then, later, it feels like there's still some left in there. It’s uncomfortable, more than painful, just… full. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. It sounds frustrating. So, primarily difficulty emptying your bladder, with a sensation of incomplete emptying and some straining. Have you noticed any changes in when you need to go—more frequent urges, or perhaps needing to get up at night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's right. And… now that you mention it, I do get up more at night. Maybe two, three times. I used to sleep right through, but lately, not so much. And during the day, I feel like I have to go more often, even if there’s not much there. It’s just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent daytime urination, nocturia – needing to get up at night – and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. It doesn't hurt to go, just… difficult and frustrating. And like I said, uncomfortable afterwards. It’s… well, my wife used to always say I held things in too long when we were out fishing. Could that have something to do with it? She’s… she passed away last year.
DOCTOR: I see. Holding it for prolonged periods can sometimes contribute to urinary issues, yes. We'll consider that. Before we go any further, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. And high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day. Otherwise, not much. Just getting old, I suppose. Oh, and arthritis in my hands, makes it hard to open jars sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, hypertension managed with medication, and arthritis. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always did the remembering of those things… She was good at keeping track of everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I just… take the pill the doctor gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I think it’s called… Lisinopril. That's right, Lisinopril. A little white pill. I take one every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. And sometimes I take a little bit of ibuprofen for my hands when they’re really bothering me, but that’s it. Nothing else. I try not to take too much of anything if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, Lisinopril daily and occasional ibuprofen as needed. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… well, she had some sort of trouble when she got older, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. I don’t think it was her bladder though, more like her kidneys. My father was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a bit of possible kidney trouble in your mother, but nothing definitive. Now, finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I never have. My wife, she smoked for a while, but she quit a long time ago. I always told her it was bad for her, and thankfully, she listened.
DOCTOR: Okay, non-smoker. And how much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Well, I drink coffee in the morning, maybe two or three cups. And then water with my meals. I don't really drink a lot, to be honest. I used to drink more when I was working outside, but now I mostly stay indoors. I guess maybe six or eight glasses a day? It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coffee and approximately six to eight glasses of water. Now, Mr. Hilber, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. We'll just listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and, if you're comfortable, I'll do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh dear. I… I haven’t had one of those in a long time. Is it… necessary, Doctor? I mean, is there anything else we could try first? It just… sounds unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Hilber, to get a complete picture. Your prostate can often provide clues to urinary issues, and it's a standard part of the exam for men your age. We’ll be gentle, and it shouldn’t take long. However, if you are truly uncomfortable, we can postpone it for now and order some initial tests, such as a urine analysis and potentially a prostate-specific antigen blood test. Those can give us a starting point. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose if it’s really important… alright, Doctor. Go ahead. But please, be gentle. Like you said. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you know? And… my wife always took care of these things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. And I assure you, we will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on your side with your knees bent. I will let you know each step as I go. Now, just relax, and take a few deep breaths.
