DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCorta. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my eyesight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, you understand, but…diminishing. It’s quite bothersome, really. I suppose you’ll want the details. It’s just…hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is often hard to explain. No worries at all, we'll get to the bottom of it. “Diminishing” is a good starting point. Can you tell me how it’s diminishing?
PATIENT: Well, things aren’t blurry, exactly. It’s more…like looking through a veil. A very thin veil, mind you. Not as if I can’t see, but…details are…muted. And it’s worse at night, naturally. Everything just…fades. It’s quite inconvenient. I used to be able to spot a deer a quarter mile away. Now…well, now I rely on my grandson. And he doesn’t have my eye, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, "looking through a veil," worse at night… that’s helpful. And you’ve noticed a change in your ability to see details, especially in low light. You mentioned it's been gradual. Roughly, how long have you been noticing this change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's been…well, a few years, I suppose. Not drastically noticeable at first. Just little things. Difficulty reading small print, that sort of thing. I attributed it to age, naturally. A man isn't getting any younger, you know. But it’s…progressed. Probably…the last year or so, it’s become truly bothersome. I find myself holding things further and further away. It’s a nuisance, really. And I refuse to be dependent on others. It's simply…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s frustrating when changes like this start to affect your independence. So, about a year now that it’s been significantly bothersome. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision at all?
PATIENT: Well…there is something. Not all the time, mind you. But sometimes…when I look at something, it’s…difficult to describe. Like there are…shadows. Not dark shadows, exactly. More like…flickering. In my peripheral vision, mostly. And it’s worse when I’m tired, I think. Or if I’ve been looking at a bright screen for too long. It doesn’t happen constantly, but it’s…unsettling. I dismissed it as…eye strain, perhaps. I spend a fair amount of time on the computer, doing…well, administrative work. It’s not exactly strenuous, but…it is work.
DOCTOR: "Flickering" in your peripheral vision, worse with fatigue or screen time…Okay. And has this flickering been accompanied by any loss of vision, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Loss of vision? No, not exactly. It doesn't go dark, you understand. It's more like…a dimming. Like looking at something through…well, like looking at something through a dirty window, perhaps. It’s…subtle. It doesn’t last long, either. Just a few seconds, usually. Long enough to be annoying, mind you, but not…catastrophic. I wouldn’t say I’ve had any blanks, if that’s what you mean. Just…a lessening of clarity. It's hard to explain these things precisely. I suppose you’re trained to ask the right questions. I simply…see it. And it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: You’re doing a very good job of explaining it, Mr. AlCorta. It sounds like these episodes are brief and don’t involve complete vision loss, but a temporary dimming or lessening of clarity. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, the doctor years ago said my cholesterol was a bit high. Put me on a…a statin, I believe it was. I stopped taking it after a while. Didn’t feel it was doing much good. And…there was something else. Years ago, a bout of…shingles. Nasty business, that. But other than that…no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, despite…certain lifestyle choices. I used to smoke, you know. Quit about ten years ago, though. Best decision I ever made. Aside from marrying my ex-wife, of course, and even that is debatable. But no, generally, I’ve been quite robust. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol in the past, treated with a statin, then discontinued. And a history of shingles. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve taken…various things over the years. Pain relievers, antibiotics…the usual. Never had any…reactions. I’ve always been fairly resilient, you see. And I’m careful about what I put into my body. Not reckless, certainly. I’m not one of those people who just pops pills indiscriminately. Though, frankly, at this point, I might be willing to try just about anything to get my eyesight back. It’s…diminishing, you understand. And it’s quite unsettling. It impacts my…dignity.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely. No known allergies, that’s good. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. None. I stopped taking the statin, as I mentioned. I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. I prefer…natural remedies, if possible. Though I haven’t found anything that helps with this…diminishing. Honestly, I've tried a few things. Some herbal teas, a special eye exercise my grandson found online…nothing seems to make any difference. It just…continues. It’s quite vexing, really. I used to be able to read the smallest print without glasses. Now…well, now I’m lucky if I can make out the large print. It's…humiliating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Now, regarding your family history, are there any relatives who have experienced vision problems, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother…she had cataracts, I believe. Had to have surgery. But that was when she was quite old. Eighty-something, I think. And my…my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was nearly blind in his later years. But I don’t know what caused it. Just…age, I suppose. The Cherokee…we don’t generally discuss these things openly. It’s…considered a private matter. And my family…well, they’re not exactly forthcoming with medical details. A stoic bunch, you see. So, I couldn’t say with any certainty. Just…old age, mostly. It’s likely just a matter of genetics, I suppose. Though I refuse to accept that it’s inevitable.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of cataracts in your mother and some vision loss in your grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, I used to smoke. Quit about ten years ago. Best decision I ever made, truly. As for alcohol…I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A good Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps. Nothing excessive, mind you. Just a social drink. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I have a certain…dignity to maintain, you see. I’m a man of principle. I don’t engage in…frivolous activities. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book. Or I used to, that is. Before this…diminishing. It's rather difficult to enjoy a good book when you can’t see the words. It’s…vexing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, former smoker, occasional social drinker, no recreational drug use. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. AlCorta. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief eye exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. I’m…anxious to find out what’s causing this…diminishing. And frankly, I’m willing to try anything to get my eyesight back. It’s…quite unsettling, you see. It impacts my…independence. Lead the way, Doctor. I trust your expertise. Though, I must say, I’m not particularly fond of bright lights. My eyes are rather sensitive, you see. Perhaps we could dim them slightly? Just a thought.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. AlCorta. We can absolutely adjust the lighting. I’ll dim them as much as possible. Let’s start with a visual acuity test. Could you please sit facing the chart, and I’ll ask you to read the smallest line you can see?
PATIENT: Very well. I hope this doesn’t take too long. My eyes are already feeling rather strained. And…I must warn you, my vision isn’t what it used to be. Don’t expect miracles, Doctor. It’s…diminishing, you see. Rapidly, it seems. Alright, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. Just read the letters on this line, starting from the left. Take your time, and tell me each letter as clearly as you can. Don't strain, and if you can’t see them, just let me know. Okay, let's start here…Can you read the top letter on this line for me?
PATIENT: …E. Though it’s…difficult to be certain. It’s rather indistinct, you see. Is that correct, Doctor? It’s…diminishing, you know. Perhaps we should move closer? This is…quite unsettling. I used to be able to read this chart without glasses.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try that. And that’s correct, that is an E. Now, the next letter…can you read that one for me?
PATIENT: …H? Is that…H? It’s very difficult to be certain, Doctor. It seems…ghostly, almost. I’m not usually this…imprecise. My vision is…diminishing so rapidly, it's quite alarming. Perhaps…perhaps it’s best to move on? I’m afraid I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta. That’s alright. We’ve gotten enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick test, your vision is significantly reduced. It’s certainly concerning that it's progressed so quickly. I’d like to perform a more comprehensive eye exam, including checking your peripheral vision, eye pressure, and examining the back of your eye. This will help me determine the cause of your vision loss. Do you have any history of glaucoma or other eye diseases in your family?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… I don’t recall specifically. My family…they weren't particularly forthcoming with medical details, as I mentioned. My mother had cataracts, but I don’t believe glaucoma was ever discussed. She simply…lost her sight, gradually, as she aged. As for other eye diseases…I truly don’t know, Doctor. My relatives weren’t the type to share such things. It's…vexing, really. To be left in the dark, so to speak, about my own family history. It makes it difficult to…diagnose anything. But yes, please, proceed with the exam. I’m…anxious to find out what’s causing this…diminishing. And frankly, I'm beginning to feel…quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I understand your anxiety. We’ll take our time. First, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. This involves looking straight ahead while I present objects in your side vision. Just tell me when you see them. Then, I’ll measure your eye pressure, which is a painless test. Finally, I’ll use a special instrument to look at the back of your eye, which will allow me to examine your retina and optic nerve. This test may require a drop to dilate your pupils, which will temporarily blur your vision. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Dilating drops… temporarily blur my vision? How temporary, Doctor? I have…commitments, you see. Though, frankly, at this point, I’m not sure I’ll be able to do much of anything if my vision continues to diminish. But still…temporarily blur my vision? Very well. Proceed with the exam. But please, be as quick as possible. And if the blurring is…extensive, I’d like to know beforehand. I have…a certain dignity to maintain, you see. I don’t want to be completely incapacitated. Just…be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I understand. The blurring will typically last for a few hours, but it’s usually manageable. We can provide you with sunglasses to minimize any discomfort. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s start with the peripheral vision test. Could you please focus on this point straight ahead?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m focusing… straight ahead. Just tell me when you…present the objects, Doctor. And please, don’t startle me. I have…sensitive eyes, you see. I’m ready… I think. Proceed when you’re ready. But gently, Doctor. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta. Can you see anything to your right?
PATIENT: No… nothing. I… I can’t see anything to my right. It’s… just darkness. Or… maybe a faint shadow? It’s difficult to be certain. My vision is…diminishing so rapidly, it’s quite alarming. Are you sure you’re presenting something, Doctor? Perhaps…perhaps it’s best to move on to the next test?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta. That’s alright. We’ll proceed with the eye pressure measurement now. This won’t hurt at all. I’m just going to gently touch a small device to your eye. Please, try to relax and don’t tense up. I’ll count to three, and then I’ll administer a small puff of air. Are you ready?
PATIENT: A puff of air…? Very well. But please, be gentle. I have… delicate eyes, you see. And I dislike surprises. Just…tell me when you’re about to administer the puff. I need to be prepared. And please, don't hold me responsible if I blink. It’s…a reflex, you understand. Proceed when you’re ready, Doctor. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta. Just relax, and look straight ahead. Here we go… one… two… three… Alright, that's all done. Now, the eye pressure readings are… elevated. Combined with your reduced peripheral vision and the rapid progression of your symptoms, it's concerning. We need to examine the back of your eye to get a clearer picture of what's going on. This will require dilating your pupils, which will temporarily blur your vision. Are you still willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Elevated…? That doesn't sound good. Not good at all. Dilating my pupils…temporarily blur my vision… What are we looking for, Doctor? What could possibly be causing all of this? And how long will the blurring last? I have…commitments, you see. Important commitments. Very well. Proceed with the examination. But please, tell me everything. Everything you find. And tell me…tell me how long the blurring will last. I need to know. I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I understand your concerns. We're looking for any signs of damage to your optic nerve, retina, or blood vessels. Elevated eye pressure can be a sign of glaucoma, which can cause irreversible vision loss if left untreated. However, there are other possible causes as well. The dilation drops will take about 20-30 minutes to fully take effect, and the blurring will likely last for several hours, potentially up to a full day. I’ll give you sunglasses to minimize the discomfort, and I recommend having someone drive you home. These may sting slightly for a moment. Just relax, and try to keep your eyes closed for a few minutes. While we wait for the drops to take effect, I'll review your medical history again and prepare a list of potential diagnoses and treatment options. Are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Sting…? Yes, I feel it. A…burning sensation. Several hours…? A full day…? A full day…? That’s… unacceptable. I have… important commitments. I simply cannot afford to be incapacitated for a full day. What are the… potential diagnoses, Doctor? What are the treatment options? And what are the chances… what are the chances of regaining my vision? Please, tell me everything. Everything you know. I need to be prepared. I simply must be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. It’s important to remember that we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet. However, based on your symptoms and preliminary findings, several possibilities need to be considered. The most concerning is glaucoma, which is damage to the optic nerve often caused by increased pressure inside the eye. Other possibilities include optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve, and retinal detachment or macular degeneration. If it is glaucoma, treatment options include eye drops to lower the pressure, laser treatment, or surgery. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent further vision loss. If it’s optic neuritis, treatment typically involves corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Retinal detachment usually requires surgery to reattach the retina. Macular degeneration has various treatment options depending on the type, including injections and laser therapy. As for the chances of regaining your vision, that depends entirely on the underlying cause and the extent of the damage. In some cases, vision can be partially or fully restored with treatment. In other cases, the damage may be irreversible. We won't know for sure until we’ve completed the examination and reviewed the results. But I assure you, we'll do everything we can to determine the cause of your vision loss and provide you with the best possible treatment. Are you with me so far, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… optic neuritis… retinal detachment… macular degeneration… injections… surgery… irreversible damage… Irreversible damage…? You mean… I could lose my sight completely…? That’s… unacceptable. Utterly unacceptable. I simply cannot… I simply will not accept that. Are you certain…? Are you absolutely certain that there’s no other explanation…? No other possibility…?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, please, let’s not jump to conclusions. I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that we haven't reached a definitive diagnosis yet. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need to gather more information before we can determine the cause of your vision loss. Right now, your vision is blurred because of the dilation drops. Once the drops wear off, we’ll be able to conduct a more thorough examination and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your peripheral vision again, examine the back of your eye with specialized instruments, and potentially order some imaging tests to get a better look at your optic nerve and retina. There are other possibilities we need to consider, such as vascular problems affecting the optic nerve, or even neurological conditions that could be affecting your vision. We’ll explore all of these options before we reach a diagnosis. And even if it is one of the more serious conditions, there are often treatments available to slow down the progression of the disease and preserve your remaining vision. I know this is a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your vision loss and provide you with the best possible care. But right now, let’s focus on completing the examination and gathering more information. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: One step at a time… gather more information… Very well. One step at a time. But… how long will this take, Doctor? How long until we have… answers? And what if… what if the answers are… unfavorable? I simply must know. I need to be prepared. I have… commitments, you see. Important commitments. And I simply cannot afford to… lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable. Proceed with the examination, Doctor. But please… be quick. And tell me… tell me everything. Everything you find. I need to know. I simply must know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I understand your anxiety, and I'll do my best to be as quick and thorough as possible. The examination itself will likely take about 30-45 minutes, depending on how well we can see once the dilation drops have taken effect. After that, we may need to order some imaging tests, which could take a few days to schedule and complete. As for the results, I'll share them with you as soon as they're available, and we'll discuss your treatment options in detail. I promise to be honest and upfront with you, and I'll answer any questions you may have. I know this is a difficult time, and I want to assure you that you're not alone. Alright, let's begin. First, I’m going to check your peripheral vision again to see if there’s been any change since the initial test. Then, I’ll examine the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope to get a better look at your optic nerve and retina. I’ll also check your pupil reflexes and eye movements. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed with the examination. But please… be gentle. And tell me… tell me everything you find. Everything. I need to know. I simply must know. I am ready… I think. But please… be quick. And be gentle. I simply cannot afford to… lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. Just focus on this point straight ahead. I’m going to present a small object in your peripheral vision, and I want you to tell me when you see it. Don't worry if you don't see it right away. Just relax and try to keep your eyes focused on this point. Can you see anything to your right?
PATIENT: No… nothing. I… I can’t see anything to my right. It’s… just darkness. Or… maybe a faint shadow? It’s difficult to be certain. My vision is…diminishing so rapidly, it’s quite alarming. Are you sure you’re presenting something, Doctor? Perhaps…perhaps it’s best to move on to the next test? It’s… just darkness, Doctor. Utterly hopeless.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. That’s alright. We’ll proceed with the examination of the back of your eye now. This will allow me to get a better look at your optic nerve and retina. I’m going to shine a light into your eye, which may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t cause any lasting pain. Just relax and try to keep your eye still. I’m just going to take a quick look. Are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Uncomfortable… yes, very uncomfortable. But… proceed, Doctor. Proceed with the examination. But please… be quick. I simply cannot… tolerate this for too long. Just… be quick, Doctor. Please. Be quick. I simply must know what you find. I simply must know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. Now, I’m going to examine your left eye. Just relax and try to keep your eye still. Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I've completed the examination of both eyes. I have some preliminary findings that I want to share with you. It's important to remember that these are just preliminary findings, and we'll need to order some imaging tests to get a more definitive diagnosis. I observed some…pallor of the optic discs, which means they appear slightly paler than they should be. I also noted some…attenuation of the retinal blood vessels, which means they appear thinner than they should be. These findings could be indicative of a number of different conditions, including glaucoma, optic neuritis, or even vascular problems affecting the optic nerve. However, it's important to remember that these findings are not definitive, and we'll need to order some imaging tests to get a more definitive diagnosis. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Pallor… attenuation… disturbing… What… what does that mean, Doctor? What does that mean for my sight? Am I… am I going blind? Tell me… tell me the truth, Doctor. Am I going to lose my sight? Just… tell me the truth. I simply must know. I simply must.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, it’s important to remember that we don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet. The findings I observed could be indicative of a number of different conditions, and not all of them lead to blindness. However, it’s true that some of the conditions we’re considering could potentially lead to vision loss if left untreated. At this point, it’s impossible to say for certain whether you’re going to lose your sight. That’s why it’s so important to order some imaging tests to get a more definitive diagnosis. These tests will allow us to get a better look at your optic nerve and retina, and help us determine the cause of your vision loss. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your vision loss and provide you with the best possible treatment. There are a number of different treatments available for these conditions, and in many cases, we can slow down the progression of the disease and preserve your remaining vision. Right now, the most important thing is to remain calm and follow my recommendations. I’m going to order some imaging tests, including an MRI and a visual field test. These tests will help us get a more definitive diagnosis, and allow us to develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… visual field test… unsettling… How long will that take, Doctor? How long until we have… answers? And what if… what if the answers are… unfavorable? Am I… am I facing blindness? Utterly hopeless? Tell me… just tell me the truth, Doctor. What are the chances… what are the chances of regaining my sight? Be honest with me. I simply must know. I simply must. I… I have commitments, you see. Important commitments. I… I cannot afford to lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I'll do everything I can to help you. The MRI and visual field test will likely take a few days to schedule, and the results will take another few days to come back. I know that's a long time to wait, but it's important to get a definitive diagnosis before we can develop a treatment plan. As for the chances of regaining your sight, that depends entirely on the underlying cause of your vision loss. If it’s caused by something that’s treatable, such as glaucoma or optic neuritis, there’s a good chance that we can slow down the progression of the disease and preserve your remaining vision, and in some cases, even restore some of your lost vision. However, if it’s caused by something that’s not treatable, such as damage to the optic nerve, the chances of regaining your sight may be lower. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your vision loss and provide you with the best possible treatment. There are a number of different treatments available for these conditions, including eye drops, laser therapy, and surgery. We’ll discuss all of your options with you in detail once we have a definitive diagnosis. Right now, the most important thing is to remain calm and follow my recommendations. I'm going to order the MRI and visual field test, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… visual field test… somewhat reassuring… Very well. Schedule the tests, Doctor. Schedule everything. But… what if… what if I cannot afford these tests? I… I have limited resources. Tell me… what is the cost? What is the cost of these tests? And if I cannot afford them… what then? Will I simply… lose my sight? Utterly hopeless. I… I have commitments, you see. Important commitments. I simply cannot… afford to lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your financial concerns, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to help you afford these tests. I know that medical expenses can be overwhelming, and I don't want your financial situation to prevent you from getting the care you need. I’m going to have my staff look into your insurance coverage and see if there are any options available to help you with the cost of the tests. We can also explore options such as financial assistance programs and payment plans. There are a number of different organizations that offer assistance to patients who are struggling to afford medical care, and we’ll do everything we can to find resources that can help you. The cost of the MRI is typically around $2,000 to $3,000, and the cost of the visual field test is typically around $200 to $300. However, these costs can vary depending on the facility and your insurance coverage. My staff will provide you with a detailed estimate once they’ve reviewed your insurance information. I want to assure you that we won't proceed with any tests until we’ve explored all of your options and found a solution that works for you. We’ll do everything we can to ensure that you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… payment plans… slightly reassuring… Very well. Explore those options, Doctor. Explore everything. But… what if… what if I’m not eligible for assistance? What if I simply cannot afford these tests? Tell me… what happens then? What happens if I cannot afford to find out what’s wrong with my sight? Will I simply… remain in the dark? Utterly hopeless. I… I have commitments, you see. Important commitments. I simply cannot… afford to lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable. And I… I have no insurance. None at all. I simply cannot… afford it. What then, Doctor? What then?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you, even without insurance. It will be more challenging, but we will explore every possible option. There are a number of hospitals and clinics that offer financial assistance programs to patients who are uninsured. We can also explore options such as sliding-scale fees, which are based on your income. Some facilities also offer discounts to patients who pay in cash. I’m going to have my staff research the facilities in the area that offer the most affordable options for uninsured patients. We can also explore options such as crowdfunding, which involves raising money from friends, family, and online supporters. I want to assure you that we won’t proceed with any tests until we’ve explored all of your options and found a solution that works for you. We’ll do everything we can to ensure that you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Crowdfunding…? Vaguely reassuring… I… I have no family, Doctor. None. And my friends… well, they have their own problems. I… I simply cannot ask them for help. What then? What happens if… if I simply cannot afford to find out what’s wrong with my sight? Will I simply… remain in the dark? Utterly hopeless. I… I have commitments, you see. Important commitments. I simply cannot… afford to lose my sight. Utterly unacceptable. And frankly, Doctor… I’m beginning to lose hope. Utterly hopeless. I… I simply don't know what to do. What then?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your despair, and I want to assure you that you are not alone. It's incredibly challenging to face these difficulties without family or friends to rely on, and I commend you for your strength in seeking help. Let me explore one more option. There are a few charitable organizations that provide free or low-cost medical care to uninsured patients in need. I’m going to research these organizations and see if there are any that might be able to help you. I also want to connect you with a social worker who can help you navigate the available resources and provide emotional support. They can also help you explore options such as disability benefits and other assistance programs. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you find a solution, regardless of your financial situation. I’m going to have my staff contact you tomorrow with a list of resources and contact information. In the meantime, please try to remain hopeful. We will explore every possible option and find a way to get you the care you need. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A social worker… perhaps that will help. But a deep sense of dread continues to wash over me. I feel a tremor in my hands, and my breathing remains shallow. Very well. Contact me tomorrow, Doctor. Contact me with whatever you find. But… frankly, I’m not optimistic. I… I simply don’t know what to do. I simply don't know what to do. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying. That's all I can ask for, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. AlCorta. I’ll contact you tomorrow with whatever I find. Please, try to remain hopeful. And remember, you’re not alone in this. I’ll do everything I can to help. Take care, Mr. AlCorta.
