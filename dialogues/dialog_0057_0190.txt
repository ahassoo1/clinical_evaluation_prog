DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s about my balance, I suppose. It’s been… difficult lately. I feel unsteady, like I might fall. It's rather troubling, to be honest. I don't quite recall when it started exactly, just that it's been worsening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling unsteady and like you might fall is definitely concerning. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say it's been worsening, can you describe how it's worsening?
PATIENT: How… it’s worsening… That’s a good question. It feels… more frequent, I think? At first, it was just now and then, perhaps after a long shift. Now… it seems to happen even when I’m resting. And the… feeling itself is stronger, if that makes sense. It’s less of a wobble and more of a… pull, sometimes. Like something is trying to tip me over. It's difficult to explain, I apologize. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. You’re explaining it very well, actually. It's helpful to know it's become more frequent and that the sensation has changed – from a wobble to more of a pulling feeling. And where do you feel this pulling sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… a tricky one. It doesn’t seem to be in a specific place, Doctor. Sometimes it's in my feet, like they aren’t quite… grounded. Other times, it’s more… central. Around my stomach, perhaps? And occasionally, it feels like it’s in my head, a sort of… dizziness that throws me off balance. It really varies, which is… disconcerting. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: It sounds quite complex, and it’s understandable that it's disconcerting when the sensation varies. Okay, so it can be in your feet, your stomach area, and sometimes you experience dizziness. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. Let me think… I work on oil rigs, you see. Rotary drill operator. It’s… physical work. And I’ve noticed it’s worse after a long shift, naturally. The fatigue, I assume. But… it also seems worse when I’m… stressed. Not that I get stressed often, but when I do… it’s quite noticeable. As for what makes it better… honestly, not much. Resting helps a little, but it doesn’t go away completely. And… I find focusing on something stable, like a wall, can help me regain my balance. But it’s a temporary fix, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse after long shifts and when you're stressed, and resting or focusing on a stable object provides temporary relief. That’s very helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask a bit more about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. My husband… he handled all of that, you see. He passed away a few years ago. And I… I haven’t had much need for doctors since then. I recall having the usual childhood illnesses, measles, things like that. And I broke my wrist once, a long time ago. But beyond that… I'm afraid my memory is quite hazy. I do have private insurance, if that helps. I believe it’s with… Blue Cross, perhaps? But as for specific conditions or surgeries… I’m truly unsure. I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s understandable, and we can certainly look into your records to see what information is available. And yes, knowing you have Blue Cross insurance is helpful. While I’m doing that, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I don’t take anything regularly, Doctor. Nothing for a chronic condition. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you understand. And… I used to take something for… anxiety, a few years back, after my husband passed. But I stopped taking that a long time ago. I can’t recall the name of it now, unfortunately. It was… a small white pill, I believe. But that was a long time ago. And I haven't needed it since. Just the ibuprofen occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for headaches and you previously took medication for anxiety, but no longer take it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. I eat a fairly varied diet, and I haven’t had any issues with food. I’ve never been stung by a bee, if that’s what you mean. And I don’t have any known allergies to medications. I occasionally get a little itchy after using certain soaps, but it’s nothing major. Just a mild irritation. So, no, I don’t believe I have any serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Alright, Lilyanna. Based on what you’ve told me, and looking at your records—which are a bit sparse, unfortunately—it sounds like this balance issue is new and concerning. We’re going to need to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam is perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, as you know, so anything that can help determine the cause would be most welcome. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m prepared for whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind, please sit here for me. I'm going to start with some basic neurological tests – checking your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It shouldn't take too long. First, let’s start with your reflexes. Can you cross your legs and relax your arms?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am ready when you are. Please, do not hesitate to let me know if I need to adjust my position. I am a bit unsteady, as you know, so… caution is advisable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Just relax, and I'll tap on your knees and ankles. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay… good response on the right side. And good response on the left. Normal reflexes. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Is that satisfactory? It's a little difficult, as you know, with my balance.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Lilyanna, but it does require some effort to maintain your balance. Now, let's try standing with your feet together and your eyes closed. Just for a moment. If you feel unsteady, please let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor… I… I don’t think I can manage this for very long. It’s quite unsteady. I feel… a little lightheaded. Perhaps we should stop?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s enough. It’s good you let me know. Okay, Lilyanna. That test confirmed what I suspected. There’s definitely some imbalance present. It appears to be worse when your visual input is removed. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your ears. Just to rule out any other potential causes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Please, proceed as you see fit. Anything that can help determine the cause of this imbalance is welcome. I appreciate your caution.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears… Ear canals are clear, no signs of infection. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72. Okay, Lilyanna. Everything sounds and looks normal so far. Given your symptoms – the imbalance, the dizziness, the feeling of being pulled – and the negative findings from the physical exam, I suspect we’re dealing with a vestibular issue. That means something is affecting your inner ear or the balance centers in your brain.
PATIENT: A vestibular issue… Is that… serious, Doctor? What does that entail? What… what are the next steps?
DOCTOR: It’s good you asked. A vestibular issue isn’t necessarily serious in the sense of life-threatening, but it can be quite debilitating and disruptive to your daily life. It essentially means there's a problem with the system that controls your balance. There are many possible causes - sometimes it's an inner ear infection, sometimes it's related to age, and sometimes it's something else entirely. The next step is to get a more detailed assessment of your vestibular function. I'd like to order a VNG – a videonystagmography. It's a test that measures the movements of your eyes, which can help us pinpoint the source of the problem. I’ll also likely want to order an MRI of your brain, just to rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A VNG… and an MRI… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will help determine the cause of this imbalance, then I am happy to undergo whatever tests are necessary. An MRI… will it be a long procedure? And… will I need someone to drive me?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. The VNG test usually takes about an hour, and it's not painful at all. It involves wearing goggles and following instructions while we monitor your eye movements. The MRI is a bit longer, usually about 30-45 minutes. It’s a loud machine, so you’ll wear headphones. And yes, you will need someone to drive you home afterward. The MRI requires a contrast dye, and it can make you feel a little drowsy. I'll write you a prescription for the MRI and a referral to the imaging center. They'll schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some vestibular rehabilitation exercises. These exercises can help retrain your brain and improve your balance. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, give you a handout with some basic exercises to start. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Vestibular rehabilitation… exercises. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds… quite thorough. And I appreciate your patience. Sarah will give me the handout… excellent. Just one thing… with the MRI… is there anything I need to be aware of? Metal in my body, perhaps? I… I don’t recall anything specific, but… it's best to be cautious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, and it’s very important. Yes, you absolutely need to inform the imaging center if you have any metal in your body. This includes things like pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, surgical implants, or even shrapnel. It’s crucial for their safety protocols. They’ll ask you a detailed questionnaire before the MRI to screen for any contraindications. If you're unsure about anything, please let them know. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. I'll also make a note on your chart to remind them to screen you thoroughly. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me. I appreciate your attention to detail, and your reassurance. I will inform the imaging center about… everything. And I will speak with Sarah about the rehabilitation exercises. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. I believe I’ll let you get back to your other patients now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarah will be in shortly to give you the handout and go over some instructions. Get some rest, and please be careful. I look forward to seeing you again after your tests. Have a good day, Lilyanna.
