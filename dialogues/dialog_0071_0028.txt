DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart... it hasn't been the best lately, you see. It feels like it's getting harder to breathe when I try to do anything.
DOCTOR: A cough and some shortness of breath, and you've noticed some heart issues… alright. Let's start with the cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, hmm… maybe three weeks ago now? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle. But it’s gotten worse, especially at night. I have to sit up to breathe sometimes. And it’s… it’s a wet cough, if that makes sense. Lots of phlegm.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, getting worse, worse at night, and a wet cough with phlegm. Okay. And what color is the phlegm, Nadene?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a bit unpleasant to talk about, isn’t it? It’s… yellowish. Sometimes a little bit greenish, I think. Not bright green, but… sort of murky, if you know what I mean. It worries me, that color.
DOCTOR: It is good you're paying attention to the color. Murky yellowish-green… alright. Have you had a fever at all with this cough?
PATIENT: No, not a fever that I’ve noticed. I check myself sometimes, and I haven't felt hot or anything. Maybe a little warm after I’ve been coughing a lot, but that's it. My daughter checks on me often, and she hasn’t said anything about a fever either. She's very good at that, making sure I'm alright.
DOCTOR: No fever… good. Now, you mentioned your heart. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with that?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… weak, like it’s working too hard. I get tired just walking to the kitchen. And my ankles… they’ve been swelling up something awful. Especially at the end of the day. I have to put my feet up, you see. Doctor told me years ago it was the heart, so I just figured it was getting worse again. It's been getting harder to breathe even without the cough, but the cough makes it so much worse.
DOCTOR: Weakness, tired easily, ankle swelling… and shortness of breath even without the cough. Okay. Has this ankle swelling been new, or has it been something you’ve dealt with before?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not new, dear. I've had it on and off for years. But it’s definitely worse now. Much worse. I used to be able to manage it with… with those water pills the doctor gave me. But they don't seem to be helping as much lately. I’m taking them every day, mind you, just like he told me, but the swelling just keeps getting bigger. It's uncomfortable, you know? And it makes it hard to get my shoes on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you see. It's getting harder to do even the simplest things. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit up straight for me, that would be great. Okay, taking a listen… I do hear a bit of a murmur, and a slightly faster rhythm than I’d like. And I’m hearing some crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. And yes, I can see some significant swelling in both ankles, and some redness as well. Palpating… some tenderness here too. Alright. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And I'd like to draw some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a BNP, which helps us assess your heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An X-ray and bloodwork… alright. I hope it's not anything too serious. I just want to be able to breathe again, you see. Will the bloodwork tell you how bad my heart is? And will the X-ray show if my lungs are… filled up with something? I hope it's not pneumonia. My grandson had that last year, and it was awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Nadene. The bloodwork will give us a better idea of how your heart is functioning, and the EKG will show us if there are any electrical abnormalities. The X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs, or any signs of pneumonia or other lung issues. We're just gathering information at this point, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Gathering information. That makes sense. Pneumonia… I was worried it might be that. My grandson was so sick. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And… will I need to stay in the hospital? I don't want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: We typically get the X-ray results within a few hours, and the bloodwork usually takes a day or two. We'll call you as soon as we have them. As for the hospital, let’s not jump ahead. We'll see what the tests show first. It’s possible you’ll just need some medication, but we need to know what we’re dealing with before we can make any decisions. I’m going to order a diuretic to help with the swelling in your ankles in the meantime. Have you taken anything for that swelling recently?
PATIENT: Yes, like I said, I take a water pill every day. The doctor gave it to me years ago. It's… furosemide, I think it’s called. But it doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to. Maybe I need a stronger one? Or maybe I need to take more? I don't want to take too much, though. I’ve heard those water pills can… well, they can make you feel weak.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious. We don't want to increase the dose without knowing what's going on. It sounds like you've been on furosemide for a long time. Okay, let’s stick with the current dose for now, and see if increasing it helps after we have the test results. I'm going to send you to get the X-ray and bloodwork done now. Do you have someone who can drive you, or will you need a wheelchair?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no wheelchair! I can walk perfectly fine, thank you very much. My daughter will pick me up. She's very good about that, always makes sure I'm taken care of. She’s waiting in the waiting room right now. She can also go over everything with me later if I forget something. It's easy to get confused these days, you know. But I'll try my best to remember. I'm a bit of a worrywart, I admit.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Having someone there to help is always a good idea. Alright, I’ll have the nurse print out the orders for the X-ray and bloodwork, and she'll explain where to go. Just let them know you’re here for Dr. Galena's orders. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's a relief to know someone is taking this seriously. I hope it's not anything too bad. But if it is… well, I trust your judgment. I’ll see you soon, I guess.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll be in touch soon.
