DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Velda Squiers, as you know. I’m here because I'm going on a cruise next month – the 18th, to be precise – and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information from my doctor before I can travel. Just a note or something to say I’m fit enough to go, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. That's perfectly reasonable. We want to ensure you have a safe and enjoyable cruise. To best fulfill that request, I'll need to gather some information from you first. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions—things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, or anything else that requires ongoing care?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, let me think… my late husband, bless his soul, he always kept track of these things. I've not been diagnosed with anything major, not that I recall. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago – lower back pain, mostly from lifting heavy boxes at work, you see, I arrange displays in shops – but that cleared up with physiotherapy. And I do get the occasional migraine, but I manage those with over-the-counter remedies and a good lie-down. Nothing that requires a doctor’s attention regularly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Squiers. It’s good you’ve been able to manage those issues effectively. To be thorough, could you describe those migraines a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, they’re not… debilitating, not usually. They start as a sort of throbbing pain on one side of my head, often with a bit of nausea. I usually feel a bit sensitive to light and sound when one comes on. And they can last anywhere from a few hours to a full day, though most are gone by lunchtime if I rest. I’ve not had one in… oh, goodness, six months now, maybe a bit longer. They used to be worse when I was stressed, but things have been quite calm since… well, since my husband passed. I take paracetamol when they come on, and that usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Squiers, that’s very helpful. And you mentioned physiotherapy for lower back pain. When did that occur, and was it a one-time treatment, or ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… let me see. It was about three years ago, I'd say. I strained it lifting a rather large display case at work – a new window display for a jewelry shop. It was very painful at the time. I had about six sessions of physiotherapy, and it really helped. I did all the exercises they gave me, and it improved a great deal. I haven't needed any further treatment since. Just a bit careful about lifting heavy things now, that's all. I try to get someone to help me if it looks too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, thankfully. Just the paracetamol for the occasional migraine, as I mentioned. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, you know, for a bit of extra health. I’ve been taking that for years, really. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Just things you can buy over the counter at the chemist. I don’t much like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Squiers. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take anything… well, within reason, of course. My late husband always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I suppose I've just been very lucky in that regard. No known allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's talk about your past medical history a bit more broadly. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think carefully… Oh, when I was a little girl, maybe eight years old, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia. I was in hospital for a week, but I recovered fully. And, goodness, that must be sixty years ago now! Other than that, no. I've always been quite healthy, really. A few colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious enough to require hospitalization. And I've never had any major surgeries or anything like that. I think I'm quite fortunate, all things considered.
DOCTOR: You certainly sound like you are, Ms. Squiers. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history. My mother, bless her, she lived to be 85, and she was very healthy right up until the end. She did have a bit of arthritis in her later years, but that's about it. My father had high blood pressure, I think, but he wasn’t very forthcoming about his health. My brother is still alive, thankfully, he's a few years younger than me and he's doing quite well, though he does worry about his cholesterol levels. And my late husband… well, he had a heart condition, which is why he… well, never mind. It was a few years ago now. Nothing much else comes to mind, I'm afraid. Not a terribly interesting family history, if I'm honest. Mostly just ordinary people living ordinary lives.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. Every family history is valuable. And I understand you may not wish to delve into difficult memories. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My husband smoked a pipe for a while, but I never touched a cigarette in my life. I always thought it was a dreadful habit. And I’m quite pleased to say I’ve never had any interest in it. Always preferred a nice cup of tea, myself. No, never a smoker. I do try to encourage others to give it up, whenever I can. It’s a terrible thing, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of sherry with my Christmas dinner, perhaps. Or a bit of wine with a nice meal, very occasionally. Nothing regular, you understand. I don't much like the taste of it, to be honest. It doesn’t agree with me. I much prefer a nice cup of tea, as I said. No, I wouldn’t say I drink regularly at all. Very moderate, if that makes sense. It’s not something I enjoy, really.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Ms. Squiers. And finally, could you tell me a little about your typical level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I don’t run marathons, if that’s what you’re asking! I used to do a bit more gardening when my husband was still about, but my back isn’t what it used to be, so I can't do as much now. I enjoy a gentle walk, when the weather allows, and I do a bit of light housework, of course. I try to keep myself active, but I don’t push myself too hard. Mostly just trying to potter about and keep busy, you know? It’s important to keep the mind active as well, I think. I do a bit of crossword puzzles and read a lot. Nothing strenuous, but I try to stay as fit as I can for my age.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite sensible, Ms. Squiers. Now, to complete the picture, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. That's perfectly alright. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding, if it will help. I suppose it's best to be thorough, isn't it? Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm a bit ticklish, I must warn you! But otherwise, go right ahead. I trust your judgement, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll take things slowly. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… very good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’ll just check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Capillary refill is good, no edema. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: Oh, that's very reassuring, thank you, Doctor. I'm glad to hear everything is within normal limits. I always worry a bit about my blood pressure, but that sounds alright. I suppose I’ve just been a bit anxious about the cruise, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I’ve been away on holiday. Is there anything else you need to check, or is that all?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Squiers, that was quite thorough. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I don't have any concerns that would prevent you from enjoying your cruise. I understand your anxiety, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way before a big trip. To summarise, you have no significant chronic medical conditions, no known allergies, you're a non-smoker with moderate alcohol consumption, and you maintain a reasonable level of physical activity. Your vital signs are within normal limits. I’m happy to provide a note to the cruise line stating that you are medically fit to travel. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much. It’s a great weight off my mind. Yes, please, a note to the cruise line would be absolutely wonderful. That’s exactly what I was hoping for. Is there anything I need to do on my end, or will you be sending it directly to them? I have all the cruise details here, should you need them.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do provide me with the cruise line’s contact information – their email address or fax number would be ideal. And a confirmation number, if you have one, would be helpful too. I can then send the note electronically. It will state that you’ve been examined, are medically cleared for travel, and have no significant health concerns that would preclude you from enjoying the cruise. I’ll also include a brief summary of your health history as we’ve discussed today. While I’m preparing that, do you have any questions for me, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, just a moment… The cruise line is “Seabreeze Cruises”, and their email address is “medical@seabreezecruises.com”. The confirmation number is “SBC45789”. And, hmm, no, I don’t think I have any questions, thank you. You’ve been very thorough and have put my mind at rest. I was just a bit worried about being asked for lots of complicated medical information, but you’ve made everything so easy. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve just sent the note to Seabreeze Cruises. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. I’ve also made a copy for your records, which I’ll hand to you in a moment. Just to reiterate, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while on the cruise – anything that concerns you – please seek medical attention on board the ship immediately. They will have qualified medical personnel available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, thank you so much. A copy for my records is very thoughtful. And I will certainly remember to seek medical attention if I need it. I’m usually very careful, but it’s always good to be prepared, isn’t it? No, I don’t think there’s anything else. You’ve been wonderfully helpful, and I feel much more confident about my cruise now. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. You’ve been a great comfort.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was my pleasure to assist you. I’m glad I could ease your mind. Enjoy your cruise! Be sure to take plenty of pictures and make some wonderful memories. If you do have any concerns after your trip, or if anything changes with your health, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a safe and enjoyable time.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor. I will certainly do that. I’ve always wanted to see the Mediterranean. And I promise I will take plenty of pictures! I’m sure I’ll be telling everyone about Seabreeze Cruises when I get back. You’ve been a wonderful help. Goodbye now, and thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Squiers. Have a wonderful trip! And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future.
