DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re… red, and kinda sore. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I see. Red, sore bumps on your shins. And you said this has been going on for “a little while” – could you be more specific about how long, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two, three months now? It started with just one, I think. And I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. Thought it was just a bug bite or something. But then more started showing up. They don’t itch, though. Just… ache sometimes, especially when I’m walking a lot. I do a lot of walking at work, you know?
DOCTOR: Two to three months… starting with one bump, then more developed. No itching, but an ache, particularly with walking. That’s helpful, thank you. And could you describe what your work entails, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work moving stock. Freight, mostly. Loading and unloading trucks, things like that. It's mostly walking and lifting. Pretty physical, you know? Been doing it for… well, a long time now. My legs are pretty tired at the end of the day, usually. But these bumps… they feel different than just tired muscles, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A physical job like that could certainly contribute to leg fatigue. But these bumps feel distinct. Are they all the same size and shape, or do they vary?
PATIENT: They're… pretty similar, I think. Maybe some are a little bigger than others, but not by much. They’re kinda round, and… raised, you know? Like little knots under the skin. And they’re definitely red. Not like a bruise, more… bright red. I haven’t noticed them getting bigger or anything, just staying about the same. My wife, she keeps telling me to go to the doctor, that’s why I’m here, haha. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s good of you to come in, and it's wonderful that your wife encourages you to take care of your health. Round, raised, bright red bumps that haven't been changing in size... That gives me a better picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. Not really. No fever, no swelling anywhere else. No pain in my joints or anything. Just the bumps on my shins and a little ache when I walk a lot. I feel okay otherwise. A little tired, but that’s just from work, I think. I haven’t been eating as well lately, either. My wife makes good food, but I’ve been working late sometimes and just grab something quick. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you for mentioning that. Diet can certainly play a role in overall health and healing. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I get a yearly checkup, and they haven't said anything about allergies. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Doctor prescribed it a few years back. And I get a flu shot every year, too. My wife makes me, haha. She's very good about that sort of thing. Do you need to know the name of the blood pressure medicine? I can try to remember it… or my wife will know for sure.
DOCTOR: That's excellent that you stay up-to-date with your preventative care and take your medication as prescribed. Knowing the name of the blood pressure medication would be helpful, yes. But don't worry if you can't recall it right now. We can access your records, and it should be listed there. Let’s move on for now. Do you have any family history of similar skin conditions, or any other significant medical issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had… something with her legs, when she was older. They got kinda swollen and… discolored. But I don’t think it was bumps like this. She had to go to the hospital for it, though. And my father, he had diabetes. He had trouble with his feet, because of that. I try to watch my sugar, you know? My wife makes good desserts, but I don’t eat too much of them. Other than that… not really. My brother is healthy as a horse, and my sisters are okay too, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Swelling and discoloration in your mother’s legs, and diabetes in your father… That’s good information to have. Thank you. Now, before I examine your legs, may I ask about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean, Doctor? Like… what I do for fun? Haha. I like to garden a little, when I have time. And I like to watch baseball. My wife and I go to church on Sundays. Is that what you need to know? I don’t really go out much anymore. Mostly just stay home and relax after work.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Aluia, thank you. When I ask about social history, I'm also referring to things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any other habits that might affect your health. It’s all part of understanding the whole picture. Do you use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife wouldn’t allow it! Haha. And I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular. Mostly just water with my meals. I try to stay healthy, you know? For my wife. And for the garden. Hard to garden when you're feeling sick.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Aluia. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to examine your legs. Please, have a seat on the examination table, and I’ll take a look. I will need to expose your shins so I can get a proper look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll sit down. Just let me… pull my pants up a little, so they don’t get in the way. Here we go. I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife will be so worried if it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I’m examining your legs now. I see the bumps you mentioned. They are raised, red, and approximately… half a centimeter to one centimeter in diameter. They’re clustered primarily on your anterior shins. They feel firm to the touch, and there doesn’t appear to be any significant warmth or tenderness beyond the ache you described. I don’t see any open sores or drainage. Based on my initial examination, the bumps are consistent with a few possibilities. One possibility is stasis dermatitis, which can occur with poor circulation, though given your activity level, that’s less likely. Another possibility, and more common given the description, is a form of localized vasculitis, possibly caused by minor trauma or inflammation. To help me narrow down the cause, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your inflammatory markers and rule out any underlying systemic conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Hmm… alright, I guess so. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I don’t really like needles, but… I’ll do what I need to do to get this figured out. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And will they take a lot of blood? My wife always worries when I get blood taken. She says I get pale easily.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Aluia. We’ll only need a standard amount of blood, just a few vials. It’s a routine procedure, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. The tests we’ll be running include a complete blood count to assess your overall health, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to check for inflammation, and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney function and electrolyte levels. We may also check your blood sugar, given your family history. It’s a fairly comprehensive panel, but it will give us a good baseline to work with. While we wait for the results, I recommend applying a topical corticosteroid cream to the affected areas twice daily. This should help reduce inflammation and alleviate some of the discomfort. I will write you a prescription for that now. Also, continue to monitor the bumps for any changes in size, color, or the development of any sores. Do you have any allergies to topical creams or medications in general?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to creams. Never had a problem with anything like that. Topical cream sounds good. Something to put on and help it, that's good. Okay, so blood tests and cream. And keep an eye on the bumps. My wife will be happy to hear we're doing something. She’s always got good ideas about what to put on things. She uses aloe vera for everything, haha. Is there anything else, Doctor? I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: No, I think we’ve covered everything for now. I'll also send a copy of the lab results to your primary care physician for their review. The lab should be able to draw the blood today, and the results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have those, I will call you to discuss the findings and develop a more tailored treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or if the bumps worsen significantly, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here is the prescription for the topical corticosteroid cream. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. My wife will be very relieved. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I don’t like going to the doctor, but… you made it a lot easier.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was my pleasure. I understand that visiting the doctor isn't always enjoyable, but I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or experience any changes. Take care, Mr. Aluia, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
