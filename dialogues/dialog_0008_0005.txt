DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. TKAC. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as the paperwork likely states, I’m here to get cleared for a senior living facility. My daughter thought it best, and honestly…I’m not fighting her on it. Getting a bit too much for me to manage things on my own these days. I bake, you see – always have – but even that’s becoming a bit of a struggle.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. A pre-admission assessment, then. That's perfectly reasonable. Baking is a wonderful hobby! And it's smart to get a little help when you need it. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about what specifically has become difficult for you?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not one big thing, Doctor. More like a lot of little things adding up. My hands…they aren’t as steady as they used to be. Makes decorating the cakes…difficult. And remembering all the ingredients... I still can remember, mostly, but it takes a good bit more concentration than it used to. Then there’s just the general fatigue, you know? Standing for long periods…gets to be a lot. I used to be able to go all day, no problem. Now, a few hours and I need to sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Hand steadiness, some memory concerns, and fatigue… all things we need to explore a bit. Let’s start with the memory. You said it takes more concentration now. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you noticed a memory lapse, or had to really focus to remember something?
PATIENT: Well, just last week, I was making a strawberry rhubarb pie for Mrs. Henderson – she orders one every month, bless her heart. I had everything laid out, all the ingredients…but I couldn’t for the life of me recall if I’d already added the sugar to the rhubarb. I had to check the recipe book, and even then, I wasn’t entirely certain until I saw the bowl was already a bit sticky. It’s little things like that, Doctor. Not forgetting how to make the pie, mind you, but…forgetting if I’d already done a step. It’s…unsettling, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is unsettling. It’s good you're aware of it, and that you have a system of checking things. Now, thinking about the fatigue… is this a new development, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It didn’t just appear overnight. Started maybe six months ago, I’d say. At first, I just chalked it up to getting older, you know? But it’s been getting worse steadily. Used to be I could bake all day and still have energy to tend to my garden. Now, if I spend a few hours in the kitchen, I need a good long nap afterwards. And it's not just baking, either. Even walking to the store…leaves me feeling drained.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this fatigue been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I’ve noticed I’ve been sleeping more, for one. Not necessarily better sleep, just…more of it. And sometimes, a little bit of shortness of breath. Not during exertion, usually, just…sitting quietly. It’s not painful, it's just…there. And I suppose…a little bit of a loss of appetite. Nothing drastic, but I don’t enjoy eating as much as I used to. I used to look forward to my meals.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sleep, some shortness of breath when resting, and decreased appetite… that’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for the last ten years, at least. I also had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but haven't had any trouble with that since. Oh, and arthritis in my hands, but that’s to be expected at my age. It flares up sometimes, but it’s mostly manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, if that makes sense. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, a history of gallbladder removal, and arthritis. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. And…let me see… Ah, yes. I also take Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams, also once a day, for cholesterol. My doctor put me on that a few years back. And occasionally, I take Ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. That’s about it, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril and Atorvastatin daily, and Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to any medication. I do get a bit of a sniffle when the ragweed is blooming, but that’s just seasonal, you know? Nothing serious. I haven't been stung by a bee in years, and I never had any trouble with food allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. My wife…God rest her soul…she was the one with all the sensitivities.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Alright, no known allergies. Now, thinking about your family history…are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, and she was remarkably healthy all her life. My father…he had heart trouble, I believe. Had a stroke when he was in his seventies. And my sister…she had diabetes. Developed it later in life. As for other relatives…I'm afraid I don't know much. We weren't a very close family, to be honest. Everyone sort of kept to themselves. It's not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble and diabetes in the family. And lastly, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean by that, Doctor? Do you mean…what do I do for fun?
DOCTOR: That’s right. Things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, what your typical diet is like, and what your general activity level is. Things like that.
PATIENT: Oh! I see. Well, I never smoked a day in my life. My wife…she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. As for my diet…I try to eat healthy, but I do have a sweet tooth. Baking, you know? I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, but I also enjoy my desserts. And as for activity…I used to be very active, but I’ve slowed down a bit in recent years. I mostly stay around the house these days. I do some gardening when the weather is nice, and I like to read. Not much else, to be honest. Mostly just taking it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol, a generally healthy diet with a sweet tooth, and a moderate activity level. That's all helpful information. Alright, Mr. TKAC, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it’s all part of the process.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. TKAC. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/85, but that’s not unusual given the clinic environment. Your heart rate is regular at 72, and your lungs sound clear. Your ears and throat look normal. I notice some mild swelling in your hands and fingers, which is consistent with arthritis. I also note a slightly diminished range of motion in your hands. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I have a few preliminary thoughts, but I'd like to order a few lab tests just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I trust your judgment. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I'm happy to comply. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. What sort of tests are you thinking of, if you don't mind me asking? Just so I have an understanding.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test – to rule out any thyroid issues. And lastly, I’d like to check your Vitamin D levels, as that can sometimes contribute to fatigue and weakness. We'll also do a basic urinalysis. It's a fairly standard set of tests. I’m writing the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw some blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn’t take too long. And then we can discuss the results when they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That all sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A thorough approach is what I would expect. Yes, I'm happy to have those tests done. Just let me know when and where I should go to get them done, and I'll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab is just through that door, and the technician is expecting you. They’ll give you instructions on how to collect the urine sample. Once you’ve completed the tests, you can come back, and we’ll discuss the results. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your thoroughness and patience. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll head down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. TKAC. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll be in touch once the results are in. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. .
