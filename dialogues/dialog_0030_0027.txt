DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. After I eat, mostly. It’s… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And it happens when I lie down, too. Makes a mess, honestly. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing something unpleasant – coming up after you eat and when you lie down, and you’d like to get to the bottom of it. I certainly appreciate your directness, and we will do our best to be efficient. To help me understand what’s happening, could you describe this “stuff” a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… food. Undigested food. And…acid, I guess. It tastes sour, burns a little. Like when you left something in the fridge too long. You really don’t want to know. Is this going to take long? I’ve got things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, undigested food and a sour, burning taste… that sounds quite uncomfortable. And I assure you, we'll try to keep this as brief as possible while still getting the information we need. This sounds like it could be related to a number of things. To help me narrow it down, could you tell me approximately when this started happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… a while. A good six months, maybe? Longer, possibly. It comes and goes, you see. Started subtly, just a little…feeling off. Now it’s… more noticeable. Definitely worse after a big meal, though. Especially if it’s… richer. You know, heavy foods. Steak. Pasta. Not like I eat salad all the time. Why does it matter when it started? It’s happening now that's what matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It’s helpful to know it’s been going on for about six months and is worse with richer foods. Knowing the timeframe helps us consider potential causes. Now, has anything changed in your diet recently, or have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, such as weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No! I eat what I’ve always eaten. Steak, potatoes, maybe some pierogi if my wife makes them. Good, solid food. No fancy stuff. And no, no weight loss. I haven’t been feeling sick, just… this. And pain? A little heartburn now and then, but I just chalk that up to… well, you know, getting older. Look, I'm a practical man. I don't go running to the doctor for every little thing. This is a new development, and I want it gone. Is this going to involve a scope or something? Because I don't do scopes.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Altine. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced any weight loss. And I understand your concern about procedures like scopes – we can certainly discuss that further if it becomes necessary. Let’s hold off on thinking about that for now. Just to clarify, when you say "heartburn," could you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: It’s a burning, right here, in the chest. Feels like…like someone’s pressing a hot coal against my sternum. Not all the time, just… after I eat, like with the… other thing. And sometimes when I lie down, especially if I’ve eaten recently. It’s not crippling, understand? I’m not doubled over in pain. It’s just… irritating. Really irritating. Honestly, this is wasting my time. I’ve told you everything. What’s next?
DOCTOR: Okay, a burning sensation in the chest after eating and when lying down, similar to the experience you’re having with the… regurgitation. That’s helpful. Mr. Altine, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and gently palpate your abdomen to see if there’s any tenderness. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a big man. I don’t need poking and prodding. But fine. Get it over with. Just…be gentle. And quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. This better be worthwhile.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Altine. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, though there is some mild tenderness when I press here, in the upper middle part of your stomach. Your weight is 51 kg and height is 197 cm. Based on what you've told me and what I've found in the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. This is often caused by stomach acid flowing back up into the esophagus. It’s common, and usually manageable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: GERD? All these fancy names… Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to confuse me. So, it's acid. That's what I figured. Allergies? Not that I know of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Nothing else. And I certainly don't go around trying medications. Look, just give me something to stop this, alright? I don’t want a lecture about lifestyle changes. I’ve lived a long life. I know what I'm doing. Do you have a pill for this or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It’s not my intention to confuse you. GERD simply describes what's happening – acid reflux. And I apologize if I'm moving too slowly for your liking. Given your symptoms and your preference to avoid extensive lifestyle changes at this time, we can try a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. This medication will reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. It's usually very effective. However, I do want to briefly mention that long-term use of PPIs can have some minor side effects, and it’s always best to address the underlying cause of the reflux if possible. But we can start with the medication and see how you respond. Would you be agreeable to trying a PPI?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill. That’s what I want. Just give me the name, the dosage, and where to get it. I’m not interested in a discussion of “underlying causes”. I’m a practical man. If the pill works, good. If it doesn’t, I’ll be back. And quickly, please. I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting. And I don't have time to waste.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I completely understand. I'm prescribing you Omeprazole 20mg once daily, to be taken in the morning, 30 minutes before breakfast. You can get this filled at any pharmacy. Please take it as directed for two weeks. If you find relief after two weeks, continue the medication for another two weeks, then we can re-evaluate. If you don't experience any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, please come back to see me as soon as possible. I also recommend avoiding lying down immediately after eating, and elevating the head of your bed slightly. Do you have any questions about the medication or these instructions?
PATIENT: Lying down? I've been lying down after eating for seventy years! Elevating the bed? That sounds ridiculous. Fine. I’ll take the pill. And I’ll see what happens. No, I don’t have any questions. You’ve wasted enough of my time already. I have gardening to do. Good day to you, Doctor. And I hope this works.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I hope the medication provides you with some relief. If you do have any concerns or questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your gardening club meeting. .
