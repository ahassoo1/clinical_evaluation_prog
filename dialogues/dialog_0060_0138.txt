DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about…weakness? And headaches, maybe? There’s been some of that in the family, I think. My brother, he used to get terrible headaches. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness and headaches. And your brother had headaches as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Horrible ones. He’d have to lie down in a dark room for hours. I don’t know if it was the same kind of headache I sometimes get, though. Mine…well, they just feel like a pressure, mostly. Not like he described. And the weakness…it comes and goes. Mostly on one side, I think. My left side? Or was it the right? Oh dear. It’s so frustrating when you can’t quite remember things. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, pressure-type headaches and intermittent weakness, potentially on the left side. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you first notice these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It's been years, I think. Not recently, though. Not like in the last few months. Maybe… ten, fifteen years ago? They weren't constant, never have been. Just…would come and go. I mostly just took some aspirin and laid down. It wasn't something I really bothered the doctor about, to be honest. Old people get aches and pains, you know? I didn't want to bother anyone for nothing. And the weakness… that's even harder to say when it started. It's not something I noticed gradually, more like… episodes. A few times over the years. Not frequent, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Episodes of weakness…and headaches that come and go for fifteen years. And you've never sought medical attention for either of these?
PATIENT: Well, not really. I mean, I told my general practitioner about the headaches once, a long time ago. She said it was probably tension headaches, you know, from stress. I used to do a lot of gardening, maybe that was it. She didn’t do any tests or anything, just told me to try to relax. And the weakness… I never really thought it was serious enough to go to the doctor. It would just…resolve on its own. My husband, bless his soul, he's gone now, he always said I worried too much. He'd just tell me to have a cup of tea. It's probably nothing, really. I’m probably just an old worrywart.
DOCTOR: I understand. However, intermittent weakness, even if it resolves, can be a sign of something more serious, Ms. Tofani. And given your family history of headaches, and the fact that this has been going on for fifteen years, I think it’s important we investigate a bit further. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it like that… I suppose it’s probably a good idea. I hadn't thought of it being serious. Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes my speech feels a little…slurred, maybe? Not always, just sometimes. And occasionally, I have trouble seeing out of one eye, but it comes and goes so quickly I always wondered if it was just my imagination. It's like a shadow, or a blur, for a few seconds. It’s hard to explain. And sometimes, I feel a little dizzy, but I get dizzy easily, so I didn’t think much of it. I suppose those could be related, couldn't they? It's just… little things. I didn't want to bother you with all of that.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech, intermittent vision changes, and dizziness…Those are all important details, Ms. Tofani, and I'm glad you shared them. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it's called. A small dose, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And I take a baby aspirin every day, just as a preventative, you know, for my heart. My daughter makes sure I take it. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, nothing fancy. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was a little low. That’s about it, I think. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea if I’m feeling unwell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure, baby aspirin, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and vitamin D. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to do a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological assessment. That means I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so it's probably a good idea. Just… don’t poke too much! My bones are a bit creaky these days, you know. And please, be gentle with my arm, I sometimes get a little twinge in my shoulder. But otherwise, go right ahead. I’ll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes… She tests the patient's reflexes, noting some asymmetry. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities, although there's mild weakness on the left side, as you mentioned. Coordination is slightly diminished on the left side as well. She tests the patient's sensation. Sensation is intact, but slightly decreased on the left side. And I noticed a slight facial droop on the left side. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that doesn’t sound very good, does it? A facial droop… I hadn't even noticed. I suppose I don’t look at myself too much anymore. See? It feels… a little stiff, maybe? And I do sometimes have trouble closing my left eye completely. It’s just a little thing, I always thought. It’s probably nothing. But if you say it's something, it must be. My daughter always says I should pay more attention to these things. I just… I hate to bother anyone with my aches and pains. I’m probably just getting old, that’s all. But thank you for checking, dear. I appreciate you taking the time. What does it mean? What do you think is going on?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, based on the physical examination findings – the asymmetry in your facial strength, mild weakness on your left side, diminished coordination, and slightly decreased sensation – I'm concerned about the possibility of a stroke, or a transient ischemic attack, often called a TIA. The fact that these symptoms have come and gone makes it less certain, but it's a serious possibility that we need to investigate immediately. The facial droop is particularly concerning. We need to rule this out. I'm ordering a stat CT scan of your brain and some blood work to assess your risk factors. I will also consult with neurology. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a stroke? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. I've heard such terrible things about strokes. A scan… and blood work? Is it… is it serious right now? Do I need to be admitted to the hospital? I… I don't do well in hospitals. All those beeping machines and… strangers. My daughter is going to be so worried. What does this mean? Am I going to… am I going to be alright? I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea. But if you think a scan is necessary… then I suppose I trust you. But please… please tell me everything you can. What are the chances it isn't a stroke? And what happens if it is?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, it’s understandable to be frightened. A stroke is a serious condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. It's important to act quickly because the sooner we diagnose and treat a stroke, the better the chances of recovery. The scan will help us determine if there's any evidence of bleeding or blockage in the brain. The blood work will assess your risk factors, such as cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Right now, it's impossible to say definitively if you've had a stroke. The fact that your symptoms come and go is somewhat reassuring, but it doesn’t rule anything out. A TIA, which is a temporary stroke, can be a warning sign of a more significant stroke in the future. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I recommend that you be admitted to the hospital for observation and further testing. We’ll need to monitor your neurological status closely. Neurology will be consulted to assess your condition and develop a treatment plan. We’ll do our best to minimize your discomfort, and your daughter can, of course, visit. I understand that you don’t like hospitals, but it is the safest course of action at this time. Do you have any allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? No, not that I know of. I just get a little hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. Medical conditions… well, I have a bit of arthritis, that’s why I take the ibuprofen sometimes. And I used to have terrible indigestion, but that’s settled down a bit now. Oh, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be, I wear glasses. But otherwise… no, nothing major. I'm generally a healthy old woman. I eat my vegetables, and I try to stay active. A hospital… I don’t know. It's just… lonely. And scary. Will my daughter be able to stay with me? And what if… what if it is a stroke? What kind of… damage can happen? Will I… will I be able to think properly? Will I be able to… garden anymore? I just… I don’t want to be a burden. I just want to be able to live out my days in peace.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, your daughter is welcome to stay with you as much as the hospital regulations allow. As for the potential damage from a stroke, it varies significantly depending on the location and severity of the stroke. It can lead to weakness, difficulty speaking, vision problems, and cognitive impairment. However, with prompt treatment and rehabilitation, many people recover significant function. The goal is to minimize the damage and help you regain as much independence as possible. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to provide the best possible care. But right now, we need to focus on getting you to the hospital so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and start treatment. I’m going to call the hospital now to arrange your admission. A nurse will be in shortly to get you prepped. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… please, tell my daughter I’m sorry for the worry. She’s a good girl. And… thank you. Thank you for listening. I… I suppose I’m ready. As ready as I’ll ever be. But… could you just stay with me for a minute? Just until the nurse comes? It’s silly, I know. But it’s… comforting to have someone here. I just… I don’t like being alone.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have other patients to see, but I'll remain here for a few minutes until the nurse arrives. Try to remain calm, Ms. Tofani. We’ll get through this. I’ll explain everything to your daughter as well. It’s important to remember that acting quickly is the best thing we can do. The nurse should be here shortly.
