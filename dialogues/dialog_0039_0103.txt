DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my back. It’s been giving me trouble, you see. Low down, mostly. Hurts to bend over, and sometimes even just to stand for too long. It's been going on for a bit now, not suddenly, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, your lower back. And it’s been a gradual onset, not a sudden injury?
PATIENT: That’s right, gradual. Not like I lifted something heavy or anything. Just... started hurting more and more over time. It makes me worry a little, to be honest. My wife, God rest her soul, she had trouble with her bones when she got older. I don’t want the same thing happening to me. Do you… do you know what could be causing it? I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your wife’s history. There are many things that can cause lower back pain that aren’t necessarily serious, but it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Sure, I can try. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, unless I really try to move the wrong way. It feels worse in the mornings, usually. And like I said, after standing for a while. Sitting isn't too bad, as long as I have a good chair. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain sometimes. It just… is there. And it feels like it’s getting… weaker, maybe? My legs feel a little shaky sometimes, too. Not all the time, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, worse in the mornings and with standing, relieved somewhat by sitting. And you've noticed some shakiness in your legs occasionally. That's helpful. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Everything feels normal, just… weak. Like the muscles aren't working quite right. And sometimes a little bit sore, but not really… pins and needles or anything like that. It’s just… a feeling, you know? Hard to describe. I’ve been trying to walk more, but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. In fact, I think it might be making it a bit worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just weakness and soreness. And walking seems to aggravate it. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm not a young man anymore, so don’t expect me to be doing any gymnastics!
DOCTOR: No gymnastics required, I promise! First, could you please lie down on your back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here I go. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My old bones aren’t as flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. And can you try to bend your knees up towards your chest, one at a time?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s alright. A little bit sore, yes, right there. Not terribly painful, but I can feel it. And yes, I can bend my knees up. It’s a little stiff, you see? Not as easy as it used to be. Do you… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, slight tenderness over L4-L5, and some stiffness with knee flexion. That's not entirely uncommon at your age, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Now, could you please try to lift each leg straight up while lying flat?
PATIENT: Alright, I’ll try. Oh, that’s a bit uncomfortable, yes. It feels like it’s pulling on my back. And… it’s not very high, is it? Not much strength there anymore, I suppose. I used to be able to do that easily when I was younger. Is that… bad? I worry a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort with straight leg raise, and limited range of motion. Don’t worry, Mr. Vankampen. We're gathering information. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might have some lower back strain and possibly some nerve irritation. It's difficult to say for sure without some imaging. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I don't think so. I haven't had any… anything like that before. And allergies… not that I know of. I’ve taken a few pills in my life, but nothing ever bothered me. I used to get a little heartburn, but that’s about it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, you understand? My wife, she was always on something, and it never seemed to help much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Vankampen. Given your age and history, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back just to rule out any fractures or other structural problems. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know when and where. And how much it will cost, if you don’t mind. I’m on a fixed income, you see. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vankampen. I understand. We'll get you scheduled for an X-ray right away. It will be done here at the clinic. Let me see… the cost is approximately $150. We do have a payment plan available if that’s helpful, and we can see if there are any assistance programs we can look into. After the X-ray, we'll review the results together and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. $150… I can manage that, I think. Thank you for checking. And yes, no lifting, no straining. I’ll try my best. Ibuprofen… I think I have some of that at home. And thank you, for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, just knowing what we’re trying to find out. I appreciate it very much. It's just… getting old is hard, you know?
DOCTOR: It is hard, Mr. Vankampen. And you’re very welcome. We’ll take it one step at a time. I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you scheduled for that X-ray. She’ll also go over some written instructions with you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your pain gets worse. Nurse, could you please come in to room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I think I can manage until then. Just knowing someone is trying to help is a big comfort. Yes, thank you again. .
