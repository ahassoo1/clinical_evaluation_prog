DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Hmm... well, it’s my ears, I think. People don't seem to speak as clear as they used to. Or maybe I don’t hear them so good anymore. It’s hard to say, really. Everything’s a bit muffled, like talking through a pillow, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be frustrating when your hearing isn't what it used to be. It is hard to tell sometimes if it's them or you, isn't it?
PATIENT: That's exactly it! My niece, bless her heart, she says I ask her to repeat things all the time. And I don’t mean to be rude, it just… slips my mind what she said right after she says it. It’s not like I’m deaf, not at all. Just… fading, I suppose. Used to hear a pin drop, I did. Now... not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fading” is a good way to put it. And it’s good you’re noticing this and bringing it to my attention. It’s common to experience changes in hearing as we get older. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me how long you've been noticing this muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… it’s been a while, surely. Not just yesterday, that’s for certain. Maybe… six months? A year? Time just… goes. I worked in that shoe factory for so long, you see. Lots of noise, clanging and banging all day. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t rightly recall when it started getting bad enough to bother me, though. Everything seems to blend together after a while, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. And working in a shoe factory with a lot of noise exposure could be a contributing factor. We'll want to consider that. Has the hearing loss been gradual, or did it seem to happen more suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Not like a bang, suddenly gone quiet. More like… the volume knob turned down a little bit at a time. Slowly, slowly. I remember thinking, “Hmm, I didn’t quite catch that,” more and more often. And then just accepting I hadn't heard properly and asking them to say it again. It’s not been a shock, not like that. Just… a slow fade, as I said. A quietening. It's more troublesome with women's voices, maybe? High-pitched sounds are harder to hear, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – that it's more noticeable with women’s voices and high-pitched sounds. That gives us a bit more to work with. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness or pressure?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, maybe. Not a constant thing. More like a faint… whistle, every now and then. It doesn’t bother me much, to be honest. I mostly notice it when it’s quiet. Like at night, in bed. And fullness… no, not really. Nothing feels blocked or anything. Just… quiet. Everything's just a bit… muted, like I’m underwater, perhaps. A bit muffled, you know? I keep having to ask people to speak up, which I don’t like doing. It feels rude.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re aware of it, and I assure you, asking someone to repeat themselves isn’t rude – it’s responsible! Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... I have my arthritis, in my hands mostly. Makes it hard to do things sometimes, but what can you do? And the doctor says my blood pressure is a bit high, but she's got me on pills for that. Been taking them for years now, I suppose. Nothing else comes to mind. I'm pretty healthy for an old fella, I think. I don't get sick much. Mostly just… tired, now and then. But that's just old age, isn’t it? I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, thank you for telling me. And good that you're managing your arthritis and blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking something. Let me see... the bottle is in the kitchen. A little white pill, I think. I just take it every morning with my breakfast. I don't really pay attention to the names, to be honest. My niece handles all that for me. She fills my pill box every week. I just… take what she gives me. I’m sorry, I can’t rightly tell you the name. I wouldn’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. Your niece helping with medications is wonderful. We can look it up in your records if you're comfortable with that. Let me just access your electronic health record here… Okay, I see here you are taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Lisinopril, that's the one! Yes, yes, that sounds right. That little white pill. You're a clever one, Doctor, finding that out. My mind isn't what it used to be, you see. I'm glad you have all this written down. It’s a relief knowing someone is keeping track of things. It's all a bit overwhelming, keeping up with everything.
DOCTOR: It’s my job, Mr. Schneer, and I'm happy to help. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my wrist when I was a young lad, falling off a bicycle. That needed a cast, I remember that. And I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must have been… oh, goodness, 30 years ago? Maybe more. Everything’s a bit hazy, you see. I was in the hospital for a few days for that. Nothing else comes to mind, not that I recall. Just the broken wrist and the gallbladder. That's all I can think of right now. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Now, about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother... she got a bit hard of hearing in her later years, I think. She used to say everyone was mumbling! And my brother, he worked in a factory too, noisy place. He wore hearing aids for a while, I believe. But other than that... not that I know of. My sister always had excellent hearing, sharp as a tack. She could hear a pin drop from across the room. But she passed away many years ago. It's hard to remember now, to be honest. Family history... it's a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Never been one for it. My father smoked a pipe, a bit of a habit he had. But I always steered clear. Never liked the smell of it, to be honest. I always thought it was a silly habit. So no, never smoked. And thankfully, neither does my niece. I'm glad she doesn't. It's a nasty thing, smoking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding, if it'll help me hear better. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm trusting you to sort this out for me. My ears have been getting worse lately, and I'd like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take a look inside your ears. Okay, there's some cerumen – earwax – present, but nothing obstructing the view. Similar on this side. Your ear canals look healthy, no signs of infection or inflammation. Your eardrums appear intact, though they do seem a bit… dull. I’m going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a better idea of where the hearing loss is occurring. I’m going to put these headphones on you and you’ll hear some tones, and I want you to raise your hand when you hear something. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Headphones are fine. Raise my hand when I hear a beep, you say? Easy enough. I’ll do my best. Hopefully, I can hear something. It’s been getting harder and harder lately, you see. But I’ll try my best. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, we’re all done. Okay, the results of this quick test confirm some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, as you mentioned. It appears to be symmetrical – meaning it’s similar in both ears. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings, it appears you have age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis. It’s very common, and the good news is there are things we can do to help. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Presby… what did you call it? Presby… oh, dear. That's a mouthful! Age-related, you say? Well, that figures. I'm not getting any younger, am I? It’s what my mother had, I suppose. So, it’s not something I did? Not from working in the factory? And you say there are things you can do? That’s good to hear! What kind of things? Hearing aids, perhaps? I've seen people wearing them, but I've never really thought about it. Tell me more, Doctor. I’m all ears... well, as good as they are!
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the factory. Noise exposure can contribute to hearing loss, and likely played a role in yours, accelerating the natural aging process. But at this point, it sounds like it’s primarily age-related. And yes, hearing aids are often a very helpful solution. They amplify sounds, making them easier to hear. There are many different styles and technologies available, and we can find one that’s right for you. We would need to do a more comprehensive hearing test with an audiologist – a hearing specialist – to determine the exact nature and degree of your hearing loss and recommend the best course of action. I can refer you to a reputable audiologist in the area. They'll perform a detailed evaluation and discuss the different hearing aid options with you. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral would be wonderful. I don’t know any audiologists, so that would be a great help. I’m willing to try anything to get my hearing back to normal, or as close as possible. It’s just… frustrating, you know? Not being able to hear what people are saying. It makes me feel… disconnected. So, a referral to an audiologist. That sounds like the next step. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, explaining everything so clearly. And not making me feel silly about asking questions. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Okay, I’m sending a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-rated audiologist just a few miles from here. The referral information will be sent to your insurance company as well. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid loud noises as much as possible, and let me know if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Avoiding loud noises… I’ll try my best. It’s not easy, with all the traffic and such. But I’ll be more mindful of it. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease. And I’m grateful for the referral. I’ll give Dr. Vance a call as soon as I can. I appreciate your time and patience. I think I'll be on my way now. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a copy of your visit summary and the referral information. Take care, and I hope you have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I will. You take care too. .
