DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit of a… concern, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. But my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been worried about me. Something about… weakness on one side? And there's been a history of bad headaches in the family. My mother had them something awful. I just… I want to make sure everything’s alright. It comes and goes, this weakness, so it’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory concerns are common at your age, Ms. Tofani. Though we should certainly investigate. And headaches… family history is always relevant. This weakness… on which side precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, let me think… it feels like… the right side, mostly. My right arm and leg, sometimes. But it doesn’t happen all the time, you understand? It’s… fleeting. Like a shadow passing over. And it’s not always the right side, now that I think about it. Sometimes it feels… everywhere, a little bit. It’s hard to pin down, really. I apologize, Doctor. I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Fleeting, and sometimes everywhere… Right. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that’s a good question. A long time, I think. Years, probably. It comes and goes, like I said. It’s never been… serious, not really. Just… unsettling. I suppose it’s gotten a little more frequent lately, which is why my daughter insisted I come see you. She worries so. I’d say… maybe the last few months it's been happening more often? It’s difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Months, you say. And regarding these headaches… are they new, or have you experienced them for a long period as well?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… those are old friends, I’m afraid. My mother… she suffered terribly. I’ve always had them, on and off, since I was a young woman. Not as bad as my mother’s, thankfully. They come and go, mostly with stress, I think. But I haven’t had a really bad one in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years? They're more of a dull ache now, if I get them at all. It’s the weakness that’s bothering me more, lately.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications for these headaches or anything else, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just the usual. A little something for my blood pressure, I believe. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. That's about it, really. Nothing for the headaches, I just try to rest when they come on. I can’t remember the name of the blood pressure medicine, though. My daughter handles most of that now. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. I’d like to do a brief physical examination, Ms. Tofani, just to assess your strength and reflexes. If you could just follow my instructions. We'll start with your blood pressure, naturally.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. My arm is right here, if you’d like. Please don’t mind if I fidget a little, sometimes I get a bit restless sitting still.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your age and reported history. Now, please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. And try to resist as I push down on them. Strength is… adequate, though slightly diminished on the right side. We will need to repeat this. Now, can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I’ll try my best, Doctor. It feels a little silly, trying to resist. There. Is that alright? I hope I’m doing it right. Sometimes my hands get a bit shaky, you know. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… within normal limits, though slightly brisk on the right side. Now, please stand up and walk a few steps for me. Please.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. There we go. Just a few steps, you said? It feels a little strange walking in here, you know. The floor is so smooth. I’m usually walking in the garden, which is much softer. Is this alright? I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Please sit down, Ms. Tofani. Based on this brief examination, and your reported history… it's difficult to say definitively. The weakness is subtle, and your symptoms are vague. Given your age, and the family history of headaches, it could be a number of things. However, the episodic weakness warrants further investigation. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. An MRI? That sounds… serious. Blood work, alright, that I can handle. But an MRI… is that really necessary, Doctor? I mean, I’ve lived a long life, and I feel… mostly alright. Is it going to be expensive? And will it take long? I just… I don’t want to put my daughter through too much trouble. She’s already so worried about me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, I understand your concerns. However, it is standard procedure to rule out more serious causes of new neurological symptoms. An MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting abnormalities in the brain. Yes, it can be expensive, and it does take some time. But it is essential for providing you with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I can provide you with a referral to a radiology center, and their billing department can discuss the costs with you directly. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms, and contact me immediately if they worsen. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. My daughter will probably want to be involved in scheduling it, she’s very good at these things. Contrast dye? Oh… I don’t think so. I’ve never had an MRI before, so I wouldn’t know. I’ve had a few injections over the years, for flu shots and things like that, but I don’t recall any allergic reactions. It’s just… I get so confused, these days. I’ll have to ask my daughter, she keeps a very detailed list of everything. Is it something I should worry about?
DOCTOR: It is always best to be cautious, Ms. Tofani. I will write a note on your referral requesting that the radiology center confirm any prior allergic reactions before administering contrast dye. In the meantime, I will write a prescription for a mild analgesic to help manage any headaches you may experience. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and the MRI. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… very sensible, Doctor. A follow-up appointment, yes, that’s good. And the pain medicine, that would be lovely. It’s just a dull ache, usually, but it’s nice to have something on hand. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even though I’m not very good at explaining things. My daughter will be relieved to hear we have a plan. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have documented everything, Ms. Tofani. Please, contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I trust your daughter will assist you with scheduling. I will see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. My daughter and I will be in touch. Goodbye.
