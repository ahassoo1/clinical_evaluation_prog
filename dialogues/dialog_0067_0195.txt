DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… alright. I don’t usually bother doctors for much, you know? It’s just… my daughter, she says I should come get a little card. A “get well” card, she called it. Even though I am well. Mostly. Just… needing a bit of encouragement, I suppose. A little note from a proper doctor might do the trick. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like you’re primarily here to address some concerns your daughter has, even if you're feeling mostly well yourself. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly do that. Could you tell me a little bit more about what’s been going on that’s causing your daughter to worry?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? It’s just… getting older, Doctor. It’s a bother, that’s what it is. Everything aches a little more. I used to be able to work all day at the factory, no problem. Now? My hands get tired. And my back… oh, don’t even get me started on my back. It’s not painful pain, you understand. It’s just… there. She keeps fussing about me slowing down. Says I shouldn’t push myself. As if she knows what I’m capable of! It's just… frustrating. A little note saying a doctor thinks I should take it easy might shut her up.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common to experience aches and discomfort as we get older. It sounds like you’re very active, and it's natural for your body to feel the effects of that over time. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, even if it’s a little… overzealous. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about these aches?
PATIENT: Oh, “aches” is a polite word for it. More like… a dullness. Like everything is just… heavy. Especially my hands, like they've been dipped in cement. It's worse after I've been working, of course. I do small assembly work, mostly little plastic bits for… well, it doesn't matter what for. And my back, like I said. It doesn't hurt unless I bend over too much, but it's always… present. It's just a general tiredness, really. And I do try to ignore it. A sensible woman doesn't go complaining to doctors over a bit of tiredness. But she insists… honestly, it’s exhausting just having a daughter sometimes. Is this what you write down? About daughters?
DOCTOR: I assure you, we don’t specifically document complaints about daughters! Though, I understand they can certainly be… spirited. It sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort in your hands and back that worsens with activity, and a general feeling of tiredness. That's helpful. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, you see. It crept up on me. Maybe… six months ago? Started with just the hands, I think. Getting a little shaky after a long shift. I just thought I was holding things too tightly. Then the back started feeling… stiff. A bit harder to bend down to pick things up. And the tiredness… well, who doesn’t get tired? It’s just… it’s been getting… more noticeable lately, I suppose. She says I've lost weight too, but I haven’t noticed. Though my clothes do feel a bit looser… It’s probably just the summer heat. It plays tricks on you, this weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six months ago you started noticing some shakiness in your hands, followed by stiffness in your back, and a gradual increase in tiredness. Your daughter has also mentioned some weight loss. That's good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me see… No, not really. I sleep alright, though I do wake up a few times during the night, but that's just old age, I expect. And my appetite is fine. I eat plenty. Though, I do feel a bit… colder than I used to, even when it’s warm. Not shivering cold, just… a bit chilly. My husband complains I'm always wrapped in a shawl, even in July. And sometimes… sometimes my fingers feel a bit… numb. Just the tips, really. It doesn't happen often, but it’s… unpleasant. I thought it was just the way I was holding my tools. You know, too tightly. Is that what you write down? About tools?
DOCTOR: We can definitely note that you’ve been feeling colder than usual and have experienced some numbness in your fingertips. And yes, we can mention your tools if you think they might be contributing to the numbness. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking personal questions! That's… not something one discusses with doctors. Really. But… alright, since you insist. No. Everything is… regular. As regular as it can be for an old woman. I haven't had any trouble with that. And my bladder… well, it works perfectly fine. I don't need to get up all night, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm being interrogated. Is this necessary for a “get well” card? My daughter is going to be thrilled if I have to tell her I’ve been discussing my… habits with a doctor. She'll never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Janeth. I understand they are personal. I just want to make sure I have all the information I need to understand what’s going on. It's important to rule out any potential underlying issues, even if it means asking uncomfortable questions. Okay, good to know those functions are regular. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: No, no illnesses. Not recently. I had a bad cold last winter, but that was months ago. A proper, sniffly, aching cold. Nothing special. And no injuries. I'm quite careful, you see. I don't go climbing mountains or anything foolish like that. A sensible woman stays on flat ground. Though… I did twist my ankle a few years back, gardening. A silly thing. Just a little sprain. It healed perfectly fine. I don't think that's relevant, is it? Really, I'm quite healthy for my age. My daughter just worries too much. She'll be pleased to hear I haven't been injured in a dramatic fashion, I'm sure. Is this enough? Can we get to the card now? A little note saying I'm "doing well" would be lovely.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illnesses or significant injuries, just a past ankle sprain. That's helpful. And yes, let's move on to the physical exam. I just want to quickly check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and do a brief examination of your hands, back, and joints to see if we can get a better understanding of what’s going on. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, that seems a bit… excessive for a card. But… alright. If you insist. I suppose I can't very well refuse, can I? Though I warn you, I don't like being poked and prodded. My daughter will be insufferable if I tell her I let a doctor examine me. She’ll be talking about this for weeks. Just… be gentle, please. And quick. A little note, that’s all I want. A simple “Janeth is doing well, but should take it easy.” That will do nicely. Do you write the notes yourself? It would be lovely if you used a nice pen.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Janeth. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and it won't take long. I'll make a note to use a nice pen for the card. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. But if you poke too hard, I’m warning you, I will complain. My daughter says I have a very loud voice when I’m upset. And she's right. She’s always right. Though, I don't see what poking has to do with a "get well" card. It's all very confusing. Just get it over with quickly, please. I have errands to run, you know. Sensible errands. Not foolish, adventurous errands.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm for me… wonderful. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. That’s within the normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… very good. Everything sounds clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Could you hold them out for me, palms up?
PATIENT: There. But don't squeeze too hard. You'll make my fingers go numb. It’s always the same. A little pressure, and they feel like… like frozen sausages. Honestly, this is ridiculous. All for a card. I could have been home making tea by now. My husband likes it strong. Very strong. He says it keeps him awake. Though, he’s always complaining about being tired… It’s a confusing world. Just get it over with. And be gentle, please. Gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just checking your range of motion here… and gently pressing on a few spots… I notice a slight tremor in your hands when they're extended, and there's a little bit of stiffness in your knuckles. I don’t see any significant swelling or redness. How about your back?
PATIENT: There. But don't push too hard, Doctor. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like someone’s been sitting on it all day. Which, come to think of it, they probably have. My husband likes to sit on the sofa, you see, and it’s a very… firm sofa. And I often sit next to him. It’s a confusing situation. A firm sofa, a tired husband, a stiff back… Honestly, I feel like I’m confessing my life story to you. Just a quick look, please. A card, that's all I want. A simple card saying I'm "doing well." Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, just gently feeling along your spine… I notice some mild tenderness in your lower back, but no signs of inflammation. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but that could be due to the stiffness. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. I'd like to order a few blood tests just to get a more complete picture. It will help us rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor. This is getting ridiculous. It started with a card, and now you want to draw my blood? My daughter will be insufferable. She'll be telling everyone I'm on death's door. Well… I suppose if you insist. But promise me it won’t take long. And promise me the nurse will be gentle. I don't like needles. Not one bit. It’s a sensible fear, you know. A very sensible fear. But is it necessary? Can't you just write the card and be done with it? A simple "Janeth is doing well, take it easy," that's all I want. Honestly, the things one has to go through for a little bit of encouragement…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Janeth. It’s not my intention to cause any stress or discomfort. The blood tests are just a precaution to help us understand what’s going on and rule out any underlying issues. It will give us peace of mind. The tests will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. It’s a standard procedure and shouldn’t take long. The nurse is very skilled and gentle, I assure you. While we wait for the results, I recommend you continue to rest when you need to and avoid overexertion. We can also discuss some simple exercises to help strengthen your back and improve your flexibility. Let me write you a lab order for the blood tests, and I’ll also jot down some information about the exercises. And, of course, I’ll write you that note for your daughter. How about this: "Janeth is doing well, but would benefit from some rest and taking it easy." Would that work?
PATIENT: Rest and taking it easy… yes, that sounds about right. My daughter will be thrilled. She's always telling me to rest and take it easy. It's exhausting, really. Exercises… well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I don’t see myself doing jumping jacks anytime soon. A sensible woman doesn't go jumping. And the card? Will it be written nicely? With a good pen? It’s important, you know. A proper card with proper handwriting. It has to be presentable. My daughter is very particular about stationery. She has a whole collection, you see. Very organized. And how long will these blood tests take? I have errands to run, you know. Sensible errands. Not foolish, adventurous errands. I need to get home before it gets too late. And my husband likes his tea strong. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll make sure the note is written beautifully with a good pen. I’ll use my favorite one—it has a lovely, smooth flow. And I promise, it will be presentable for your daughter. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes to draw, and then the results usually come back in 2-3 business days. The nurse will let you know when they’re ready. Here’s the lab order. You can take this to the lab on your way home. They’re located just down the street. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid overexerting yourself. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s the note for your daughter: "Janeth is doing well, but would benefit from some rest and taking it easy. Wishing her continued good health." Is there anything else I can do for you today, Janeth?
PATIENT: Hmm… the handwriting is quite nice. Very legible. My daughter will approve. No, I think that’s all. You’ve poked and prodded enough for one day. And you're making me go for blood tests. Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it. I suppose I should be going. I have errands to run, you know. Sensible errands. Not foolish, adventurous errands. And my husband likes his tea strong. Very strong. I hope these blood tests don’t take too long. And I hope they don’t find anything alarming. A sensible woman doesn’t want any alarming findings. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. For the card and the poking and the blood tests. It’s been… an experience. Oh, and one more thing. Tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. Very gentle. A sensible woman doesn't like needles. Not one bit. Sensible errands… strong tea… gentle needles… Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it.
