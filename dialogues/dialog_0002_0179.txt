DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Ranjan. It is… a pleasure. I am here because… well, it’s difficult to explain. Words. They do not come so easily now. It is frustrating, you understand? I find myself… searching.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It can be incredibly frustrating when you feel like you're losing your words. Let's take our time and figure this out. To start, can you tell me when you first started noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That is a good question. It was not sudden, not like a switch. More… gradual. Perhaps… six months ago? Or was it longer? I… honestly, it is hard to say precisely. It began with forgetting names, I think. Then… common things. The word for… a chair, for example. Small things, at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, starting with forgetting names and then progressing to common words like "chair." That gives us a starting point. And has it been steadily getting worse over those six months, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Steadily, I believe. Though some days are… better than others. It is not a constant struggle. But… the bad days are becoming more frequent, yes? And on those days… it is very difficult to communicate. Even with my wife… before… it was… troubling.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's been gradually worsening with more frequent bad days. It sounds stressful for both you and your wife. Besides the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes in your memory, or any trouble with things like understanding what people are saying, or recognizing familiar faces?
PATIENT: Understanding… no, not really. People speak, and I understand them. Faces… I recognize my friends, my family. Though… sometimes, the names… they are slow to come. Like they are… hiding. But recognizing who they are… no, that is fine. I do not believe so. No, just the… the words. And sometimes… I repeat myself. I say the same thing twice, without realizing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no trouble with understanding or recognizing people, just difficulty with word retrieval and some repetition. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Before… my wife, she handled most of those things. I… I know I have Medicare, of course. And the doctor… he used to check my blood pressure. It was… sometimes a little high. But nothing… serious, I think. No diabetes, no heart problems that I am aware of. I try to eat well, you understand. Simple foods. Not much… excitement.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little high blood pressure in the past, but nothing currently being treated. And you said your wife handled most of your medical care before?
PATIENT: Yes. She… she passed away last year. It was… unexpected. A heart attack. After that… I have not been very good at keeping up with things. I go to the doctor when I have to, but… I don’t always remember what he says. And I certainly don’t remember what she told me. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you haven’t been keeping up with everything. It’s a lot to manage, especially when you’re grieving. Okay, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. The doctor gave me something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. I take one each day. And… sometimes, if my knee bothers me, I take ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing else, I believe. Vitamins… no, I do not take vitamins. My wife, she was the one for those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking a medication for high blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for your knee. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I… I apologize. My wife always filled the prescription. She kept track of everything. I just… take the small white pill each morning. I can bring the bottle next time, if that would help? I do not remember the name, or the dosage, or… anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. Bringing the bottle next time would be very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is a difficult question. My mother… she became forgetful in her later years. But it was just… old age, I think. She would misplace things, forget appointments. Nothing serious. My father… he was very sharp, right up until the end. I do not recall any… specific memory problems in the family. My siblings… they are both doing well, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some memory issues in her later years, but nothing specific that stood out. Let's move on to social history. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone now, yes. My wife… she is gone. But I have a daughter, she lives about an hour away. And a few friends in town. They visit sometimes. I go to church on Sundays. It is… a quiet life. I try to stay busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you have support nearby and stay active. Okay, Sherrell, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It's a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam – things like checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… alright. If you think it will help. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. I’m getting a reading of 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… I am following it. It is… a little blurry, perhaps? But I can see it. I am trying my best. Do not worry if I am slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little blurry is good to know. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to gently press down on your arms. Your resistance is slightly reduced on your left side. Finally, I’m going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. Your gait is a little unsteady, with a slight shuffle. Okay, thank you. You can sit down now. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, there are a few things that could be contributing to your memory difficulties. The elevated blood pressure, the slight weakness on your left side, and the unsteady gait are all concerning. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but I suspect this could be early signs of vascular dementia, or possibly a mild stroke.
PATIENT: Dementia…? A stroke…? Oh dear. I… I do not understand. What does that mean? Will I… forget everything? Will I… become a burden? I just want to be able to… remember.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Sherrell, and it's completely natural to feel frightened when you hear those terms. Let’s take things one step at a time. “Vascular dementia” means that there's been some reduced blood flow to parts of your brain, which can cause problems with memory, thinking, and reasoning. A “stroke” is when blood flow to the brain is completely blocked. Sometimes, people have small strokes that don’t cause obvious symptoms, but they can still contribute to cognitive decline over time. It’s not necessarily a guarantee that you’ll forget everything. The progression of dementia varies greatly from person to person. And there are things we can do to manage the symptoms and slow down the decline. The first step is to get some further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. I would like to order a brain MRI to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out other possibilities. I also want to do some blood work to check for other underlying conditions. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist – a doctor who specializes in brain disorders – for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An MRI…? More tests…? A neurologist…? It is… a lot. I… I do not know. Will the MRI… hurt? And what will the neurologist do? I just want to understand… what is happening to me. It is frightening to think… that my mind is… fading.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sherrell. It is a lot to take in, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. The MRI is a painless imaging test. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It's a bit loud, but we'll give you earplugs. You'll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hearing aids – before the scan. The neurologist will conduct a more thorough neurological exam, ask you detailed questions about your memory and thinking skills, and review your medical history. They may also order additional tests, such as a cognitive assessment. They will then be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. To clarify, the tests will help us understand what is happening, so we can develop the best plan to support you. It's not about confirming something terrible, it's about getting the information we need. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in MRI scans?
PATIENT: No, I do not believe so. My wife always handled those details. I have never had an MRI before. She… she told me I am a little claustrophobic, though. I do not like small spaces. Will the machine be… enclosed? That sounds… frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about the allergies. And it's important that you told me about the claustrophobia. The MRI machine is a relatively enclosed space, but it's not completely sealed. There’s an opening at both ends, and you can talk to the technician throughout the scan. They can also give you a mild sedative to help you relax if you're feeling anxious. We can discuss options for managing your anxiety before the scan. There are also open MRI machines available, although they often don't provide the same level of detail. We can explore that possibility if you're concerned. For now, let's focus on scheduling the MRI and getting the neurologist referral. I'll have my assistant come in and provide you with the necessary paperwork and information. Do you have any questions before I have her come in?
PATIENT: No, I… I think not. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for not… dismissing my concerns. The option for a sedative… that sounds… helpful. Yes, please. I would appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my job to listen and help you understand what’s going on. And yes, we can absolutely discuss a sedative to help you relax during the MRI. I’ll have my assistant, Emily, come in now to get everything scheduled and answer any further questions you may have. She’s very knowledgeable and will walk you through the process step-by-step. Emily, could you please come in for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I appreciate your kindness.
