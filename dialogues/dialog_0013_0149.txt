DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Morenomartinez, is it? Such a long name. Well, I don’t rightly remember why I’m here, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting them to do things to me? Honestly, doctors these days. Always poking and prodding. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Wynell. It’s very common to feel that way, and it’s wonderful your daughter is looking out for you. We definitely don’t want to do anything to you, just with you to make sure you’re feeling your best. Okay. Well, let’s start with what’s been going on generally. Even if you don’t remember specifically why you scheduled the appointment, can you tell me about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Hmm. Well, my feet… they ache. Always have, really. But more lately, I suppose. It's just… old age, you know? Things wear out. I used to be a dancer, you know. A good dancer. But that was… a long time ago. Everything hurts a little bit these days, but the feet are the worst of it. And I don't need anyone telling me what to do about them. I've been a podiatrist for… well, a very long time. I know feet.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Being a dancer and then a podiatrist, you definitely know your feet! It sounds like you’ve had a very active life. And you're right to be the expert on your body. Even so, sometimes it's helpful to get another perspective. When you say it's "more" lately, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Another perspective? Hmph. Well, they used to ache after a long day, that’s all. Now they ache just… being. It’s a constant throb, really. And it’s making it hard to… well, to do anything. I used to love gardening, but bending over is just awful. And standing? Forget about it. My daughter keeps saying I should go to someone, but I’ve always managed on my own. I don’t need… gadgets and pills and whatever else they try to push on you these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. It sounds incredibly frustrating to have something interfere with things you enjoy, like gardening. And you're right, sometimes it's just about finding the right approach, and not necessarily rushing into anything you don’t want. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a dull ache, mostly. Like a heavy weight on them. Sometimes it feels like little needles poking, especially in the arches. And it’s worse at night, of course. That’s when everything hurts more, isn’t it? It’s not… sharp, not usually. Just a constant, nagging discomfort. Honestly, I’ve had worse with… well, never you mind. It’s just old age, I tell you. Everything’s just wearing out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A dull ache with needles, worse at night… I appreciate you describing it so clearly. And it's good to know you've noticed it's worse at night. Now, just to get a better overall picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the foot pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, my ankles seem a bit swollen sometimes. Not terribly, just… puffy. And my skin gets dry and flaky, especially around my heels. Always have had dry skin, though. And… oh! Sometimes my toes feel a little numb. Not all the time, just… occasionally. Like they’ve fallen asleep. Is that important? Honestly, I’ve always just ignored it.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to mention, thank you. Swelling, dry skin, and numbness in your toes… all those things can be related. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that's a long story. Let me see… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Later in life… well, my blood pressure was a bit high for a while. They put me on a pill for that, but I stopped taking it. Didn't like the way it made me feel. And… I think the doctor said something about my cholesterol once. But honestly, I don't pay much attention to those things. I've always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I don’t believe in letting doctors fuss over me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Previous high blood pressure, stopped medication due to side effects, and possible cholesterol issues. It's good to know what's been going on in the past. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I was in the hospital once with pneumonia, but that was a long time ago. Before your time, I’m sure. Other than that… no, I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid major medical problems. I’ve always been a strong woman. And I’ve always taken care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a past case of pneumonia. That's good information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when it flares up. It's over-the-counter, nothing serious. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Can't hurt, can it? And my daughter makes me take fish oil. She says it’s good for my brain. Honestly, I don't know if it does anything, but she insists. I try to humor her.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over-the-counter arthritis medication as needed, a multivitamin, and fish oil. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever as a child, but I grew out of that. My daughter is always asking if I'm allergic to anything, but I tell her, "If I were allergic to something, wouldn't I know by now?" Honestly, I think she worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said it was a filthy habit. And I wholeheartedly agree. I’ve always taken care of my health, you know. I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize it.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one. A nice Cabernet Sauvignon. It's good for the heart, you know. And it helps me relax. Nothing excessive, mind you. I'm not a drinker. Just a little something to enjoy with my meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Alright, Wynell, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your feet, ankles, and overall circulation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. I suppose so. But don’t go poking around too much, dear. I don’t like being touched unnecessarily. And don't expect me to wiggle my toes for you. I've got my dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. Absolutely no poking around, and no toe-wiggling required unless you want to. I’ll just take a quick look and feel, and we’ll go from there. Okay, I'm just going to take a look at your feet and ankles. I see a little bit of swelling here, and the skin is a bit dry, as you mentioned. I'm feeling your pulses now. They feel a little weak, but that's not necessarily concerning. Are you experiencing any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain there. A little tender, maybe, but that's just from old age. Everything aches, remember? Honestly, I've had worse. But you're being very gentle, dear. I appreciate that. Some doctors just barge in and start poking and prodding without any consideration. You're a much nicer doctor than most.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Wynell. I always try to be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m just checking your range of motion now. It seems a little stiff, but that could be due to the swelling and dryness. And just checking your sensation… can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel that. It’s… a little tingly, maybe? But I can feel it. Honestly, my feet have always been a little numb sometimes. It’s nothing new. I used to think it was from wearing high heels when I was a dancer, but who knows? It’s probably just old age. Everything’s falling apart, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Reduced sensation, but you can still feel touch. Alright, Wynell, that’s all for the physical exam. I've documented some swelling, dry skin, limited range of motion, and reduced sensation in your feet. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms related to peripheral neuropathy and potentially some arthritis. The swelling could be contributing to the discomfort and limited range of motion. The reduced sensation in your feet is also something we should address.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Arthritis? Oh, goodness. Sounds serious. What does that mean? And what are you going to do about it? I don't want any pills, dear. And I certainly don't want any surgery. I just want my feet to stop aching, that's all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Wynell, that's not too much to ask at all. Let’s take it one step at a time. Peripheral neuropathy simply means there’s some damage to the nerves in your feet, which can cause pain, numbness, and tingling. It’s common, especially as we get older. Arthritis is inflammation of the joints, which can cause pain and stiffness. The good news is, there are many things we can try to manage these conditions without resorting to pills or surgery right away. We can start with some simple measures like foot care, stretching exercises, and potentially some over-the-counter pain relief. We can also look at supportive footwear. Would you be open to trying some of those things?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter pain relief… maybe. But stretching exercises? I'm not sure I can bend over that easily anymore. And supportive footwear? I have plenty of shoes! But they're all comfortable, thank you very much. Honestly, I think I've managed on my own for this long. I don't need anyone telling me what to do. But… if it won’t involve pills, I suppose I could try a little foot care. What does that entail? And don't tell me to soak my feet in Epsom salts. I've tried that. It doesn't help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. We will absolutely respect your preferences. No Epsom salts, no problem! And we’ll start slowly. Foot care, in this case, means keeping your feet clean and dry, moisturizing them regularly to prevent cracking, and wearing socks that wick away moisture. It also means checking your feet daily for any cuts, blisters, or sores, as neuropathy can sometimes make it harder to notice those things. And we’ll discuss proper nail trimming. Would you be willing to try focusing on those things for the next few weeks, and then we can check back in and see how you’re doing?
PATIENT: Clean and dry feet… moisturizing… I suppose I can do that. My daughter always tells me to moisturize. And I do check my feet, sometimes. Not every day, but sometimes. It's just… a nuisance, you know? But if it will help stop the aching, I’m willing to try. As long as it doesn’t involve any poking and prodding. And what about these socks? What kind of socks are we talking about? I have plenty of socks.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Wynell. Every little bit helps. And yes, as long as it doesn’t involve poking and prodding. As for the socks, we’re talking about socks made of materials like cotton or wool, that will wick away moisture and keep your feet dry. Avoid socks that are too tight, as they can restrict circulation. You don’t need to go out and buy anything special right now, just try to choose socks that are comfortable and breathable. I’m also going to give you a handout with some information about peripheral neuropathy and foot care tips. It has pictures, which might be helpful. And I’ll write down a note for your primary care doctor, letting them know what we discussed today. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Pictures? That's a good idea, actually. I’m not as good with reading as I used to be. And letting my doctor know is fine. She’s a nice woman, but she always wants to run tests. I try to avoid tests if I can. So… clean and dry feet, good socks, and pictures. And no poking and prodding. Is that all? I hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for now. Clean and dry feet, good socks, and pictures. And absolutely no poking and prodding. We’ll start with these simple measures and see how you’re doing. I’ve also written a note for your primary care doctor. I recommend you follow up with me in six weeks to let me know how things are progressing. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’m glad we had this conversation, Wynell. I hope you have a wonderful time at your gardening club meeting. And remember, if your feet start aching, come see me. .
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old woman. I appreciate that. And I will try to take care of my feet. But don't expect miracles. .
