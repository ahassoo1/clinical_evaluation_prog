DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one with some… encouragement. My ex-wife… she doesn’t send cards anymore. And it’s… lonely. It’s just a small thing, but it would mean a lot. I don’t need treatment or anything. Just a nice card.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I understand. That’s… not typically what I do here, but if writing a card would genuinely help, I’m happy to do that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and sometimes those small gestures do make a big difference. Just to be clear, though – and I want to make sure I cover all bases – you're not experiencing any physical symptoms or health concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Always been strong. Worked with boilers my whole life, you know? Keeps a man fit. It’s just… a feeling. A bit of… emptiness, I suppose. And the cards… well, they used to come. Now they don’t. It’s the principle of the thing, really. A little kindness goes a long way. I don’t want to bother you with anything medical, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early, I understand completely. It sounds like this is more of an emotional need, and that’s perfectly valid. It's good you're recognizing that and reaching out. I'm happy to write a card for you. Before I do that, though – and this is just me being thorough – would you mind if I asked a few quick questions, just to get a broader sense of things?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… I suppose. As long as they’re not about… my health. I already told you, I’m fine. Strong as an ox. But go ahead, Doctor. If you must. Just don’t expect me to know fancy medical words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no fancy medical words, I promise. These aren’t about your physical health, more about just… how you’re generally doing. Just a few to get a better picture. Let’s start with this: have you noticed any big changes in your life recently, besides the cards not arriving?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, the divorce, of course. That was… a change. Been a couple years now, though. Hard to believe. And… I retired last year. Used to working hard, you see? Boilers don't fix themselves. Now… not much to do. Mostly just sit around. It’s quiet. Too quiet, maybe. I used to be a busy man. That's about it, I suppose. Nothing else much has changed.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, divorce a couple of years ago, and retirement last year. That are big life changes, Early. It’s completely understandable that you might be feeling… a sense of loss or adjustment with those things. It takes time to adapt to new routines and find new sources of fulfillment. And, just to clarify—when you say “quiet,” are you feeling… sad or lonely often?
PATIENT: Lonely, yes. That's a good word for it. Sad comes and goes. But lonely… it’s always there, a bit. Used to having someone around, you see? Someone to talk to. Someone to share things with. Now… just me. And the television. It’s not the same. I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining. I’m a strong man. But it’s… difficult. And the cards… they would just be a small reminder that someone is thinking of me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're not complaining at all, Early. You're being very honest about how you're feeling, and that takes strength. It’s perfectly normal to feel lonely after such big changes, and it’s okay to acknowledge that. It sounds like you're missing connection, and that card would be a small but meaningful gesture. And you’re right to want that. I'm happy to write that card for you. But I also want to mention – and this is just me as your doctor looking out for you – sometimes feelings of loneliness and sadness can be more than just a normal reaction to life changes. Sometimes they can be a sign of something else. Would you be open to me just asking a few questions to get a better sense of how often you're feeling this way, and if it's interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Interfering… well, no, not really. I get up, I eat, I watch the television. I keep the house clean. I don't suffer, Doctor. I'm just… not happy. And I miss the cards. A few questions won't hurt, I suppose. But don't expect me to understand any fancy medical talk. And I don't want any pills. I don't believe in all that. Just the card, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. No pills, I understand completely. I won’t push anything you don’t want. I just want to make sure I’m understanding things fully. Let’s start with this: on a typical day, how many hours would you say you spend actively engaging with something you enjoy – something that really makes you feel good, besides watching TV?
PATIENT: Actively engaging… hmm. That's a good question. Honestly? Not many. Maybe an hour. I read the newspaper sometimes. Fix things around the house. But it's not the same as… having someone to talk to. Or receiving a card in the mail. It's just… quiet time. A lot of quiet time. I used to be a busy man, you see? Always something to do. Now… not so much. It's just the television, mostly. And thinking. Too much thinking, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, about an hour of actively engaging in enjoyable activities. And a lot of quiet time, and thinking. That tells me something, Early. Now, this is a tricky question, but it’s important. Have you found yourself losing interest in things you used to enjoy, even besides the activities you mentioned?
PATIENT: Losing interest… well, yes, a bit. Used to like fishing. Haven’t been in a couple years. Too much trouble to go by myself. And… I used to enjoy going to the movies. But it’s not the same without someone to share it with. Everything’s better with company, you see? Even the movies. Even the fishing. Now… I just sit around. And think. And watch the television. And miss the cards. It's silly, really. But it's the principle of the thing.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Early. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of loss and a feeling of disconnection, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling down. It sounds like you’ve lost some enjoyment in activities you used to love, and you’re missing the connection with others. I want to be honest with you. Based on what you’ve told me – the loneliness, the loss of interest in hobbies, the feelings of sadness, the quiet time, and the strong desire for connection – it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Now, that doesn't mean you're "sick," or that you need pills immediately. But it does mean it might be helpful to explore these feelings a little further. Would you be open to me talking to you about some resources that could help, like support groups or counseling?
PATIENT: Counseling? Support groups? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I’m not crazy! I just miss the cards. I’m a strong man. I worked with boilers my whole life! I don't need… groups of people feeling sorry for themselves. And I certainly don't need counseling. I just want a card. A simple "Get Well" card. Or maybe one with some encouragement. Is that too much to ask? I'm telling you, it's the principle of the thing. And I don’t need any fancy medical help. Just the card, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I absolutely respect your feelings, and I understand you don’t want counseling or support groups. I’m not going to push anything you don’t want. You’re right, it’s your decision. I apologize if I overstepped. I just want to make sure I’m looking out for your well-being, and sometimes these feelings can be more than just a simple reaction to life changes. So, let’s forget about all that for now. You want a card, and I’m happy to write you a card. What kind of message would you like me to write?
PATIENT: That's better, Doctor. Thank you. Something… encouraging, I suppose. Something about… strength. Or resilience. Something to remind me that I’ve gotten through hard times before. And maybe… maybe something about friendship. Even if I don’t have much of it anymore. Just a simple message. Nothing fancy. And… maybe write it in a nice, blue pen. I always liked blue.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Strength, resilience, and friendship. And a blue pen. I can do that. "Dear Early, Thinking of you and sending encouragement. You've weathered many storms in your life, and you have the strength to navigate whatever comes next. Remember your resilience, and hold onto the hope of brighter days and renewed connections. Sending my best wishes." How does that sound?
PATIENT: That’s… perfect, Doctor. Absolutely perfect. Thank you. That’s just what I needed. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. And the blue pen… a nice touch. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Early. I’m glad I could help, even in a small way. And remember, if those feelings of loneliness or sadness return, or if you ever just want someone to talk to, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m going to document our visit, and I’ll be sure to include the card. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you again. And… have a good day. A very good day.
DOCTOR: .
