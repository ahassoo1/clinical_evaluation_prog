DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawther. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings a young man like yourself into my office today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Right, well… it's my head. Been gettin' these headaches. Pretty bad ones, actually. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda… races. It’s been happenin’ on and off for a while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say. Well, that's not terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. It’s just… hard to remember exactly when they started, or how often. It feels like it's been months, maybe longer? They just… show up. And then they go away, and then come back. It's not like every day, but enough to be annoying, you know? And worryin’. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Worrying” is subjective, Mr. Lawther. We need specifics. Let's try this: can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, the headache… It’s like… a really tight band around my head, kinda. Not like a stabbing pain, more like… pressure? And it feels like it's on both sides. Sometimes it’s worse in my forehead, sometimes more at the back. It's just… a solid ache, if that makes sense. And everything kinda gets brighter, like lights are too strong. It doesn't last hours, thankfully. Usually just… a while. I don't know. Thirty minutes, maybe? An hour, if it's a bad one?
DOCTOR: “A while.” Again, with the imprecise language. Is there anything specifically that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I've noticed, really. I mean, nothin' obvious. I work in a warehouse, so it can get pretty warm sometimes. But everyone else is okay. And it happens when I’m just relaxin’ at home too. Sometimes when I’m stressed, maybe? But I’m pretty much always a bit stressed, to be honest. Divorced and all, you know?
DOCTOR: “Stress.” Everyone claims stress. Let’s move on. Do you experience any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, the sweating. And my heart races, like thumpin’ really fast. And sometimes I feel a bit… sick to my stomach, kinda queasy. Not throw-up sick, just… unsettled. And I think I’m more sensitive to light when it’s happenin’. Everything seems too bright, like I said. Does that… help? I’m tryin' to remember everything, honestly. It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: “Trying.” Very well. Let’s get some basic medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin' football. And I had the chickenpox, obviously. But nothin' serious, Doc. Never been told I had anything… like a condition. I'm pretty healthy, generally. Or I was, before these headaches started. I haven’t really been to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: And any family history of migraines, neurological issues, or… anything significant?
PATIENT: Uh… my mom had really bad headaches sometimes, I remember that. But she just always said it was stress. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't know what. He died when I was pretty young. No one really talked about it much. No one else, not that I recall. I’m not really close with my family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's address your current medications. Are you taking anything at the moment, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a thing. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I've tried some ibuprofen for the headaches a couple of times, but it didn’t really do much. That’s why I came here, actually. It’s not gettin’ better on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and neurological function.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. That sounds good, Doc.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal, cranial nerves intact, motor strength appears within normal limits. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds normal, no murmurs detected. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. However, based on the information provided, a tension headache is a possibility. But the episodes of sweating and racing heart warrant further exploration to rule out other conditions.
PATIENT: Other conditions? What kind of other conditions, Doc? Is it… serious? I'm gettin' a bit worried now. I just thought it was headaches.
DOCTOR: “Worried” is understandable, Mr. Lawther. I am merely being thorough. We need to rule out things like… anxiety, hyperthyroidism, even rarer possibilities. To do that, I am ordering a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function. Furthermore, I would like you to keep a detailed headache diary, noting the time, duration, intensity, and any associated symptoms or triggers. Based on the results of these tests, we can formulate a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding stress as much as possible… which I realize is easier said than done.
PATIENT: Okay… a diary, blood tests, and… an electrocardiogram. That’s a lot. Right. And how long will the tests take? And… what if it is somethin' serious? I don't have insurance, Doc. I'm kinda worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: The tests should be completed within 48-72 hours. As for the cost… I am aware of your uninsured status. The clinic offers a sliding fee scale based on income. You will need to speak with our billing department regarding the specifics. Here are the requisitions for the tests, and the information for the billing department. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist if your symptoms persist or worsen despite these initial investigations. Do you have any other questions, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. No, I think that’s all for now, Doc. Just… tryin' to process it all, I guess. Thank you… for lookin' into it. And for the sliding scale. I appreciate it. I think I’ll… go get those tests done. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with my office once you have the results. Do not hesitate to contact us if you experience any sudden changes in your condition. .
