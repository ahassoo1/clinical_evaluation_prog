DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kammer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Early Kammer. I have been coming here for... some time now. Not that it matters much.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s focus on today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Sink, is it? I just… I thought maybe you could write me a little something. A card. You know, a “get well” or… encouragement. My niece, she is having a hard time. And a card from the doctor… that means something, you understand? It shows she should take things seriously.
DOCTOR: A… card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like you give people when they are sick, or… feeling down. It’s just a small thing, but it would be… helpful. She doesn’t listen to me, you see. Thinks I worry too much. But a doctor… that’s different. Is this not something you do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am a physician. I provide medical care. Writing cards is… not within the scope of my practice. Is there a medical concern you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Medical concern? She is having a hard time, isn't that medical? All this stress… it’s bad for the body! And you won’t even write a little note? Doctors these days… no compassion. I don’t understand. What do you do if it's not helping people feel better?
DOCTOR: I diagnose and treat illnesses, Mr. Kammer. I can assess your niece if she is a patient here and you have her permission to discuss her medical history with me. Otherwise, frankly, this is a waste of my time, and yours. Do you have an actual medical complaint you are experiencing today?
PATIENT: Well! That’s… quite rude. I came here for a simple kindness, and you’re talking to me like… like I’m bothering you. My niece is a good girl, she just needs a little encouragement. And if you won’t help, I… I don’t know why I even bother coming here anymore. I guess things really have changed. No compassion at all.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kammer. I can document that you requested a note for your niece. But I am not going to write one. Is there anything else, medically relevant, that I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Document it? Like… a complaint? Is that what you’re doing? I just wanted a card. A simple card. Never mind. I’ll find someone who understands the importance of being… helpful. You should think about that, Doctor. Really think about it. .
