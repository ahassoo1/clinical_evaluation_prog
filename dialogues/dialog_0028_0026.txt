DOCTOR: Right. Ardelle Oitker, 81. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… this tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. I just… feel absolutely drained. Like all the strength has been pulled right out of me. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers being off? Something about my muscles, I think. I don't rightly remember all that doctor-speak. It's just… not like me to be so weak.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… and some lab results flagged something with your muscles, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Numbers. He kept pointing at them. I told him I don’t understand those things. I used to be able to… well, I used to do things. A lot of things. It’s hard to explain. It's just…everything feels heavier now. Even getting out of the chair is a struggle sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when it hits. And it’s been happening more and more lately.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s intermittent, this weakness… and worsening. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… exactly pain. More like… achiness. A deep ache, mostly in my arms and legs. It's not sharp, and it doesn’t come on suddenly. It’s just… a dull, uncomfortable feeling. Like I’ve done too much, even when I haven’t done anything at all. And it's worse after I've been resting, strangely enough. Shouldn't it be better after resting? I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Worse after resting… that is unusual. Alright. And besides the tiredness and achiness, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! My husband, bless his heart, says I’ve been a bit… muddled lately. Forgetting things, you know? Not big things, not yet. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was saying mid-sentence. He worries about it, naturally. But I’m 81, doctor! It's bound to happen, isn't it? Though I don't recall it being this bad before. It's just… everything feels a bit fuzzy sometimes. Like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy memory… common at your age, certainly. Any trouble with balance or vision?
PATIENT: Well, my balance isn’t what it used to be, I’ll admit. I’m always reaching for something to hold onto. But I thought that was just… getting old! I haven't fallen, not yet, thankfully. And my vision… a little blurry, maybe, but I’ve had cataracts for years. The doctor said I was too old for surgery, something about the risks. Honestly, I barely notice it anymore. It’s the tiredness that’s bothering me. It's just… debilitating. Makes me feel useless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said your husband has noticed changes in your memory… Has anything changed in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I haven’t been eating as much. Everything just… tastes bland, somehow. Not that I’m trying not to eat, it's just… doesn’t appeal to me like it used to. And I suppose I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, you know? It's not something I bother with. It’s just… another thing that feels off. Everything feels… diminished.
DOCTOR: Diminished… Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Goodness, doctor, are you asking about… that? Well, I suppose… a bit irregular. Sometimes… difficult. But again, I'm 81! Things change, don't they? It’s just… another inconvenience. I don't like talking about these things. It's not very dignified. Is all this… normal? Is this just what happens when you get old?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a broad term, Mrs. Oitker. And frankly, dismissing symptoms as simply “getting old” is… unhelpful. Now, let’s move on. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, let me see… Just a few. I take something for my blood pressure… a little white pill. And something for my arthritis… a yellow one. Oh, and sometimes I take something for… well, for my sleep, if I can’t get to sleep. My doctor prescribed it, but it doesn’t always work. I don't really keep track of the names, you know? My husband handles most of that. He’s very organized. But I'm pretty sure that’s all. Are you sure you need to know all this? It all seems so… complicated.
DOCTOR: It is complicated, Mrs. Oitker. Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was… ages ago. And I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, a long, long time ago. But it wasn't a bad reaction. Just a little rash. Honestly, doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It’s been so many years. And I haven’t been sick much, thankfully. I used to be very strong. Very resilient. But not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a standard procedure. Please just try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Must I? It’s been… a while. I don’t like being poked and prodded. It makes me feel… vulnerable. But… if you think it’s necessary, doctor. Just… please be gentle. And don’t take too long. I have a lot to do, you know. Even if I can’t remember what it is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Oitker. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright. Let's start with your reflexes. Please relax your leg. Hmm. Diminished. And now the other side. Also diminished. Weakness in both legs. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… is that alright? It feels… difficult. I used to have such a strong grip. I could… well, never mind. It doesn't matter anymore. Is something wrong, doctor? You seem… concerned. Are my legs very bad?
DOCTOR: Weakness is present, yes. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are diminished. Alright. It seems we need to run some blood work to investigate further. And possibly an EKG to check your heart function. It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Oitker. Don’t worry.
PATIENT: Oh. More tests… Honestly, doctor, it's all very overwhelming. Blood work, EKGs… it all sounds so serious. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it something terrible? I just want to know… what's happening to me. I feel so… frail. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, I understand your anxiety. But jumping to conclusions won't help. We need to gather information before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood work will help us assess your muscle function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying conditions. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm and identify any potential cardiac issues. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to be thorough. I'll order the tests now, and we can discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend a high-protein diet and light exercise, if you're able.
PATIENT: High-protein diet… light exercise… Honestly, doctor, it all sounds so… difficult. I barely have the energy to get out of bed, let alone exercise. And what kind of high-protein foods? I don’t even like meat. This is all very overwhelming. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, I'm afraid I'm out of time for today. We've covered what needs to be covered. The lab results will be sent to you, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I recommend discussing dietary options with a nutritionist. Have a good day.
