DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well… seems I gotta get checked out for… somethin’. A team, you see? They want me to… try out. For sports. It's… important, I think. My… ex-wife keeps askin’. Though, frankly, I don’t recall which team.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you’ve been asked to participate in some athletic tryouts, and you’re here for a general medical evaluation to ensure you’re fit to do so. That’s perfectly reasonable. Could you tell me a little more about what kind of sports tryouts these are?
PATIENT: Sports… hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain’t what it used to be. It's… runnin' and… throwin', I think? Maybe kickin’? It involves… a ball, definitely. A round ball. Young fellas these days, they do… everything. It's not like when I was young. Much more complicated. Though, I was always pretty good at… well, something. I just don't remember exactly what. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bartok. We can certainly work through this. Memory issues can be common, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. To best assess your fitness for these tryouts, and to rule out any underlying causes for your memory concerns, let’s try to gather as much information as we can. So, if we put aside the specifics for a moment – the running, throwing, kicking – are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… my knees ache sometimes. Especially when it rains. Old war wound, you see. Not a real war, mind you. Just… baseball. A long time ago. And I get tired easy. But that's just… age, isn't it? Everyone gets tired. And… I forget where I put my keys. A lot. Does that count? My ex-wife says it's… inconsiderate. But she says a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so knee pain, particularly with changes in weather, fatigue, and some difficulty with recall – forgetting things like your keys. That's helpful. And the knee pain – can you describe it?
PATIENT: Well, it's… a dull ache, mostly. Starts in the joint, you see. Feels like somethin’s grindin’ together. Worse in the mornin’, or after I’ve been sittin’ for too long. Like an old machine, needin' oil. It doesn’t… stop me from doin’ things, exactly. Just… reminds me I ain’t twenty anymore. It's a bad ache, sometimes. But, like I said, I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Fatigue… hmm. It's just… tired. All the time. Not like… sick tired. More like… heavy tired. Like carryin’ a sack of rocks. I used to be able to work all day, you see. Buildin' things, fixin’ things. Now… I gotta sit down after a few hours. And I don't sleep as well as I used to. Wake up… a lot. Sometimes I'm just… staring at the ceiling. Thinkin'. Mostly about… things. And my ex-wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Thank you for sharing that. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind. This is what we call a ‘review of systems’. I’ll ask about different parts of your body, and you just let me know if you’ve experienced any issues. First, let’s talk about your heart. Have you ever had any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Heart… hmm. No chest pain, not really. Though, sometimes, when I climb the stairs, I get a little… winded. But that's just… old age, right? Palpitations… no, I don't think so. Maybe once or twice, felt like my heart skipped a beat, but it didn't bother me. Shortness of breath… not unless I'm really exertin' myself. Climbin' those stairs, you see. Or… tryin’ to keep up with my ex-wife’s arguments. Those always take my breath away.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your lungs?
PATIENT: Lungs… hmm. Never smoked, if that matters. Sometimes I cough, a little. Especially in the mornin'. Just a tickle, really. Doesn’t produce much. No wheezing, no… fancy stuff. I get a cold sometimes, like everyone else. Nothing serious. Just… a cold. Mostly in the winter. My ex-wife says I should wear a scarf. She's always tellin' me what I should do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your nervous system. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, weakness, numbness, or tingling?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Dull ones. Mostly behind the eyes. Like pressure. Not terrible. I take somethin’ for ‘em. Doesn’t always work. Dizziness… no, not really. Maybe once in a while when I stand up too fast. Weakness… no. Numbness… no. Tingling… hmm. Sometimes my fingers get… cold. Especially in the winter. But that's just… the cold. My ex-wife says I need gloves. She's very… observant.
DOCTOR: Okay. You mentioned some difficulty with your memory earlier – forgetting where you put things, for example. Has this been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. That's a good question. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's fine. Others… I forget what I had for breakfast. Or why I walked into a room. It's… frustrating. My ex-wife… well, she reminds me. A lot. Says I'm losin’ my marbles. Says I need to… stimulate my brain. Whatever that means. It's just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anyone else noticed changes in your memory, besides your ex-wife?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I don't see many people, you see. Mostly just… the fella at the hardware store. And he just wants to sell me things. Doesn't pay much attention to my brain, I suspect. My… neighbors sometimes, but we just wave. No one really talks about my memory. Just… my ex-wife. She notices everything. Everything. It's… a gift, I suppose. A very… critical gift.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… The doctor, a long time ago, told me my pressure was a little high. Gave me some pills. I took ‘em for a while. Didn’t seem to make much difference. Stopped takin’ ‘em. Don't think I got anything else. Never been in the hospital. Just… a few scrapes and bruises from baseball. And that war wound, you see. Not a real war, mind you. Just a bad slide into second base.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. But that was a long time ago. And… I had a bad knee, a long time ago. They… looked at it, but they didn’t cut it open. Just… wrapped it. And gave me some pills. Didn't seem to help much. That's about it. No fancy surgeries. Just… a few scrapes and bruises. And that war wound.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died when I was young. My mother… she lived a long time. Healthy as a horse. My sister… she’s got arthritis, I think. Bad knees. Like me. As for memory problems… not that I recall. My ex-wife… well, she remembers everything. So, no. No memory problems in the family. Just… a few scrapes and bruises. And that war wound.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. Bad for you, you see. Drink… sometimes. A beer with dinner. Nothing fancy. Maybe a glass of wine on the weekends. Recreational drugs? No. Never touched ‘em. Bad for your brain, you see. I like to watch television. And… fix things. Around the house. That's about it. Just… watch television. And fix things. And… avoid my ex-wife. When possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes, when I'm around cats. But that's just… cats, you see. And… I think I had a reaction to a bee sting once. A long time ago. But that’s about it. No fancy allergies. Just… cats. And bee stings. And… my ex-wife’s criticism. That’s a pretty severe allergy, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. I used to take somethin’ for my pressure, but I stopped. And I take a little somethin’ for my knees sometimes, when they really bother me. But that's just… ibuprofen. Over the counter, you see. Nothing fancy. Just… ibuprofen. And… sometimes I take a vitamin. But I forget what kind. Just… a vitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. A physical examination, you say? Well… alright. I suppose so. Just… don't expect much. I'm an old man, you see. And… try not to poke too hard. My knees are a little sensitive. And… avoid my ex-wife's gaze. She's very… observant.
DOCTOR: I'll do my best, Mr. Bartok. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, and your respiration is 16. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your knees exhibit some mild tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line bilaterally. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with flexion. I also notice some mild crepitus with movement. Alright. That's the physical examination. Nothing overly concerning, but we'll need to investigate further. I recommend a few blood tests to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend an X-ray of your knees to assess for any underlying arthritis.
PATIENT: Hmm. Blood tests and an X-ray, you say? Well… alright. Sounds… complicated. But I suppose if you think it's necessary. What exactly will these tests tell you? And… will they be painful? I don't like needles. And… my ex-wife will probably want to know all the results. She's very… thorough.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a baseline of your overall health, checking for things like high cholesterol, diabetes, and how well your kidneys are functioning. The X-ray of your knees will help us to see the bones and cartilage and determine if there's any sign of arthritis. The blood draw usually causes only mild discomfort – a quick pinch. And the X-ray is completely painless – it's just a brief exposure to radiation. It’s a very low dose, and perfectly safe. As for your ex-wife, we can certainly discuss how much information you'd like me to share with her. We can go over the results together, and you can decide what you'd like to tell her. I will, of course, respect your wishes. I’m going to order these tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of the blood draw. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. I'll give you the requisitions when we are finished. Do you have any questions about the tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Questions… well. Will these tests take long? I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital all day. And… will they interfere with my television schedule? I have a very important show tonight. And… will they tell my ex-wife everything? She tends to… overreact. I just want to get this over with. And… maybe find out what's wrong with my knees. And… remember what team I’m trying out for. It's all very… confusing.
DOCTOR: The blood draw should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray will be even quicker – about 10 minutes. You shouldn’t be away for too long, definitely not long enough to miss your show, I assure you. As for your ex-wife, we will discuss the results with you first. We’ll go over everything together, and you can decide what, if anything, you want to share with her. I completely understand your concerns. My priority is your health and your comfort. We're going to focus on getting to the bottom of what's going on with your knees and addressing your fatigue and memory concerns. And hopefully, we can figure out which team you're trying out for too! While we wait for the results, I recommend taking it easy, avoiding strenuous activity, and getting plenty of rest. Here are the requisitions. If you have any questions or concerns while you’re at the lab or imaging center, don’t hesitate to ask them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I think that's all. Just… try to remember I have a show to watch. And… don't tell my ex-wife anything. Unless I tell you to. She'll… interrogate you, you see. She’s very… persistent. And… maybe, if you see a baseball bat lying around, you could… hold onto it for me. Just in case. You never know. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… helpful. I think. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a television to catch. And… hopefully, a team to try out for.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I completely understand. I will definitely keep your preferences in mind. And I'll be sure to remember your show! I will hold onto anything that's requested... just in case. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
