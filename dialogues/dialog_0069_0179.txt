DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Yes. Well, it is… the words. They do not come so easy anymore. I… I forget them, you see? It is very frustrating. I am here because of difficulty finding the right words. It is… a little embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sherrell. It can be frustrating, and you're right to seek it out. It's good you came in to discuss it. No need to be embarrassed at all – these things happen, and we'll try to figure out what's going on. When did you first start noticing this difficulty finding the right words?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. It was… some time ago. Not suddenly, you understand. More… slowly. Perhaps… six months? Or was it longer? It is difficult to say exactly. I… I do not recall the precise moment. I remember… conversations with my wife… being easier. But… that was before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six months, a gradual onset. That's helpful to know. And has this been consistent over the last six months, or has it gotten worse, better, or stayed about the same?
PATIENT: It… I think it has been getting a little worse. Not quickly, but… I stumble more now. I have to… think harder. Before, the words just… came. Now… I pause. I search. Sometimes, I find them. Sometimes… not. It makes talking… tiring.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a gradual worsening over the past six months, and it’s becoming more effortful to speak. That’s important information. Besides the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… people tell me I speak softly. I do not… realize it, you see? My wife… she would tell me. Now… I am not so sure. And… perhaps… I repeat myself sometimes. But it could be… I just want to make sure I am understood. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially speaking softer and repeating yourself occasionally. That's good you and your wife have noticed these things. And to get a better picture, I’d like to ask some more questions. Have you experienced any difficulty understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: Understanding…? No, not really. I… I hear the words. I process them. It is… finding my words that is the problem. Not… hearing others. They speak clearly enough, I think. It is my own speech that is difficult. Perhaps… sometimes, if the room is noisy, I must ask them to repeat. But that is just… being older, no?
DOCTOR: That's good to know – understanding others seems to be intact. And you’re right, asking for repetition in noisy environments is common as we get older. Now, let's talk a bit about other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your memory?
PATIENT: Memory…? Hmm. That is… a difficult one. I forget things, you see? Everyone forgets things, no? I… sometimes misplace my glasses. Or… I go into a room and forget why I went there. Small things, mostly. Not… important things. I remember my wife… and my life with her, very clearly. But… everyday details… they are… less precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some forgetfulness with everyday details, but your long-term memory seems to be good. That’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your vision, or any weakness or numbness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not really. I need glasses, you see, and sometimes they are smudged. But… my vision itself is… okay, I think. And… weakness? No. Numbness? No. I… I can move everything. Both sides. I do not feel… weak or strange. Everything functions… as it should, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Hmm. Let me think. I… I had high blood pressure, for a time. But it was… controlled with medication. I… I stopped taking the medication, a few years ago. My doctor said it was okay. And… my wife, bless her soul… she had diabetes. But I do not have diabetes. Aside from that… no. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of controlled hypertension and a family history of diabetes. That’s important information. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. Yes, I had my appendix removed, when I was young. A very long time ago. And… my wife, she had a hip replacement. But I… I have not been hospitalized for anything else. Just the appendix, a very long time ago. A minor thing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take anything. No pills. No vitamins. Nothing. I… I prefer to avoid them, if possible. I drink a lot of water, though. And… I try to eat healthy foods. That is… my medicine, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And to finish up with the background, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, I do not think so. I… I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I… I sometimes get a little itchy when I am around cats, but that is just… a little itch. Not… a proper allergy. I can breathe fine. Everything is… okay, that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Sherrell, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It's just to get a better sense of everything. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I… I will do whatever you think is best. You are the doctor. Please, proceed. I… I hope you can find out what is happening. It is… a little frightening, you see? To forget the words.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It is concerning, but we’ll do our best to figure it out. And I’ll explain everything as we go along. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope… Take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Good. Sounds clear. Alright, strength seems good in all your limbs, and your reflexes are normal. I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and touch your nose with your finger… Good. And now, I want you to say “apple” several times… and repeat a phrase after me: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Everything seems… generally normal on the quick exam, but I do notice a slight hesitancy in your speech, particularly when initiating sentences, and a mild difficulty recalling some of the words. Based on this initial assessment, it could be a number of things. It could be related to mild cognitive impairment, but it's too early to say for sure. We need to do some further testing. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd also like to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including possibly an MRI of the brain. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work and… a neurologist. Yes. That is… a little frightening, an MRI… but if it is necessary, then so be it. I… I just want to know what is happening. So that I can… understand. And perhaps… slow it down, if possible. I… I thank you for your time and patience. It is… a relief to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my job to listen and help you understand what’s going on. I completely understand your concerns about the MRI, but it's a valuable tool for getting a clear picture. We'll get that scheduled for you as soon as possible. I’m going to write up a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist at City Hospital. She's excellent. I'll also give you a lab order for the blood work. It's a standard panel to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out other potential causes. In the meantime, I recommend trying some simple memory exercises, like doing crossword puzzles or Sudoku, and staying socially active. I will also give you a handout with tips for improving your memory and some resources if you want to learn more. Here you go. This is your referral to Dr. Reed, the lab order, and the handout. The lab is located just down the street at 123 Main Street. Please schedule the appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think you have explained everything very clearly. 123 Main Street… I will remember that. And Dr. Reed… I will call tomorrow. I… I do not think I have any more questions. Just… thank you again. For listening. And for your help. It… means a great deal.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, follow up with Dr. Reed as soon as you can. I’m optimistic we can figure this out and get you on the right track. Take care, Sherrell. And I hope to hear from you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
