DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osterholm, it’s… my vision. It’s not what it used to be, naturally. One expects a bit of decline at my age, though I find it rather inconvenient, frankly. It's just… things aren’t as sharp as they once were, you understand. It’s a nuisance, mostly.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, yes. Well, "naturally" doesn't quite cut it as a diagnosis, does it?
PATIENT: I wasn’t expecting a diagnosis from a simple statement, Doctor. I was merely… establishing the nature of my concern. It seems rather presumptuous to dismiss a perfectly reasonable observation. Though, I suppose that's the world we live in now.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Alcorta, I have a lot of patients, and I need to get a handle on why your vision is changing. When did you first notice this… “nuisance”?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor? It’s difficult to pinpoint. It wasn't a sudden event, you understand. It’s been… a gradual fading. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. I don't concern myself with trivial details like exact dates. Things just weren't as… vivid. And it’s worse at night, naturally. Driving is becoming… less pleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this blurring in one eye, both eyes?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though, it’s… more pronounced in my left eye, perhaps. It's difficult to say with certainty, Doctor. I don't spend my days meticulously cataloging the clarity of my eyesight, you know. It simply… isn't as good as it once was. A rather straightforward assessment, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, straightforward doesn't tell me much. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t required corrective lenses in all my fifty-two years. I have perfectly… had perfectly good vision, until recently. It’s not as though I’ve been ignoring a problem that’s been glaringly obvious for decades, you understand. It's a new development. A rather inconvenient one, at that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I’ve been a bit… fatigued, perhaps. But honestly, Doctor, who isn’t fatigued these days? The world is a trying place. And my eyes feel… dry, occasionally. Though, I suspect that’s due to the air conditioning. It’s always excessively cold in these places. I doubt it’s anything significant.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I doubt it will reveal anything I haven’t already told you. But if it puts your mind at ease, proceed. I suppose I should brace myself for a barrage of… questions.
DOCTOR: If you'll just sit here, I'll check your visual acuity first. Please read the letters on the chart when I ask. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax, you say? It's hardly conducive to a proper assessment when one is subjected to… unnecessary scrutiny. But proceed, Doctor. I haven’t all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting with this eye. Cover your left eye with your hand. And just read the smallest line you can see clearly. Don’t strain, just tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Well… the top line, naturally. Everything is rather… indistinct. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I told you I have vision problems. It's hardly a revelation. Is this some sort of… test?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, it is a test. To quantify the problem. Now, please read me the next line, if you can. Even if it’s blurry. It helps me understand how much your vision has changed.
PATIENT: "H… T… F… R…" Honestly, Doctor, this is quite tiresome. And quite frankly, humiliating. Is there a point to all of this, or are we simply indulging in… academic exercises? It’s all rather vague, and I'm not certain I'm contributing much useful information.
DOCTOR: Alright, now let's try your left eye. Cover your right eye. And again, just read the smallest line you can see clearly.
PATIENT: Doctor, it’s even worse with this eye. Barely anything is discernible. It’s all just… shapes. Honestly, this is quite distressing. Are you certain your equipment is functioning properly? Perhaps you should recalibrate it. This is hardly a productive exercise. It’s just… confirming what I already told you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's check your pupillary response. I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes. Don't look directly at the light, just relax.
PATIENT: Shine a light in my eyes? Is this a standard procedure, Doctor? It sounds… invasive. And I’m not certain I appreciate the lack of explanation. Though, I suppose I haven’t much choice. Proceed, if you must. But I expect a full accounting of what you're about to do, and why. I’m not one for surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay… pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but slightly sluggish. And now, I'm going to test your peripheral vision. I want you to look straight ahead, and I'm going to hold up fingers in your side vision. Just tell me when you see them.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Very well. Though I suspect it’s rather diminished. Honestly, Doctor, this feels rather… unnecessary. I came in complaining of vision loss, and you're subjecting me to a battery of tests that are simply confirming the obvious. It's hardly a groundbreaking discovery. Proceed, if you must. But I trust you'll expedite the process. My time is valuable, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay… some mild constriction in the lower quadrants of both eyes. Alright, Mr. Alcorta, I think I have enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing some early signs of cataracts and potentially some age-related macular degeneration. This isn't an emergency, but it does require further investigation. I'm going to order some retinal imaging.
PATIENT: Cataracts and… macular degeneration? Honestly, Doctor, you’re diagnosing me with ailments I’ve never even heard of. And based on what? A few blurry letters and a light in my eyes? It sounds rather… alarmist, frankly. And “further investigation”? Retinal imaging? Is this absolutely necessary? It all sounds rather… expensive. And inconvenient. Honestly, I suspect it's simply a matter of needing new reading glasses. Though, I suppose that’s a perfectly reasonable profit margin for you. Is that what this is all about?
