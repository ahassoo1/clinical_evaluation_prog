DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It took long enough to get an appointment. It’s this foot, Doctor. This awful, awful foot. It just won't heal. And it’s painful, terribly painful. I’ve had…well, a long time with it, and it’s just getting worse, not better. I expect you to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the appointment wait time, Ms. Cannington. And I assure you, I will do my best to determine the cause of your foot pain and formulate a plan to address it. “Long time” is rather vague, however. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Vague? I don’t think it’s vague. It's been…oh, goodness, let me think. Since last November, I believe. Yes, November. After that little trip to Majuro to see my niece. That’s when I first noticed it, a little sore. I didn’t think much of it at the time, of course. A bit of walking, you know, that’s all. But now…well, now it's a mess. And I do have the sugar, you know. The doctor back home warned me about my feet. He didn't seem to know what he was doing, though. That's why I came to see you.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, the pain began in November after a trip to Majuro. And you mentioned you have diabetes, and your previous doctor expressed concern about your feet due to that. That's important information. Now, Ms. Cannington, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, it’s just painful. A throbbing, burning ache. It's worse when I try to walk, naturally. And it keeps me up at night, even with the medication. It feels…raw. Like it’s constantly being rubbed with sandpaper. And there's a smell, you know. Not a good smell. I've been trying to keep it clean, but…it’s just there. I've tried those foot soaks the nurse told me about, but they don't do much good. It’s a nuisance, really. A terribly unpleasant nuisance.
DOCTOR: A throbbing, burning ache, worse with walking, keeping you awake at night, and a raw sensation. You also mentioned a noticeable odor. And the soaks haven’t provided relief. I see. Now, Ms. Cannington, do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? Not really. It feels numb sometimes, if I don't look at it. But that’s just because it's so painful, I suppose. It's hard to tell what I feel and what I think I feel, if you understand. Tingling…well, maybe a little, when I first wake up. But that goes away after I’ve been up for a while. It’s the pain that’s the problem, Doctor. Not a little tingling. Honestly, I don’t know why you ask so many questions. Are you going to look at it or just keep questioning me?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem excessive, Ms. Cannington. It’s simply crucial for me to gather as much information as possible to accurately assess your condition. I assure you, I am going to examine your foot. However, a proper examination requires a thorough understanding of your symptoms. Now, before I do that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. There's the metformin, for the sugar, of course. Two pills with breakfast, two with dinner. And…oh, yes, the lisinopril, for my blood pressure. One pill every morning. And the pain medication. That tramadol, I think it is. The doctor back home prescribed it. I take two of those when it gets really bad. Though they don't seem to help much anymore. I also take a calcium supplement, because of my bones, you know. And a vitamin D pill. That’s it, I think. Unless…oh, and the fish oil capsules. For my heart. It's a lot of pills, Doctor. A lot. It's a wonder I remember them all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That is a comprehensive list. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Always have. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though I don’t eat as much as I used to, naturally. Getting old, you know. As for medications…no. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. Though that tramadol does make me a bit drowsy, but that’s not an allergy. It just makes me sleepy. It doesn’t make my throat close up or anything like that. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person, despite everything. It’s just this foot. It’s ruining my life, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Cannington, if you'll allow me, I'd like to examine your foot. Please remove your shoe and sock. I will need to perform a physical assessment to evaluate the condition of your skin, circulation, and sensation. I’ll also be checking for any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Finally! About time. Honestly, I’ve been sitting here answering questions for an hour. There. Be careful, it’s rather tender. And don’t be surprised if it smells. I told you. It's awful. Just get it fixed, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I see. The ulceration is located on the plantar surface of the foot, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. There is significant surrounding erythema and edema. Capillary refill is prolonged at greater than 3 seconds, indicating diminished circulation. Sensation is markedly reduced to monofilament testing. There is a noticeable odor present. Ms. Cannington, this is concerning. It appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer with evidence of a possible infection and compromised circulation. We need to address this promptly to prevent further complications.
PATIENT: Complications? What kind of complications? Amputation? Is that what you’re going to tell me? I knew it. I just knew it. This is what happens when you have the sugar, isn’t it? They just let it get worse and worse until they have to take something off. I don't want an amputation, Doctor. You will fix it, won’t you? You have to. I still have so much living to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, please try to remain calm. While the situation is serious, we are not at the point of discussing amputation. However, it is a potential risk if the infection progresses and we are unable to restore adequate circulation. My goal, and my priority, is to avoid that outcome at all costs. To determine the best course of action, we need to obtain some further testing. I’d like to order a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, as well as a vascular study to assess the blood flow to your foot. We’ll also need to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. Additionally, I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection in your system. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, it’s always tests. I feel like a laboratory rat. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. But please, hurry. And explain everything to me. I don't want any surprises. What will these tests show? And what happens after the tests? Will I be in pain? And can I still go to my niece's birthday next month? She’s turning seven, you know. It's very important. I just want to get this sorted out, Doctor. That's all. Just get it fixed. And no talk of amputation, please. It frightens me.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Cannington, and I apologize for the need for further testing. It’s essential for me to have a complete picture of your condition before formulating a treatment plan. The wound culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, which will guide the selection of appropriate antibiotics. The vascular study will assess the blood flow to your foot, allowing us to determine if there are any blockages or narrowing of the arteries. As for your concerns about pain, we will do everything possible to manage your discomfort. I’ll prescribe a stronger pain medication until we can determine the underlying cause of the infection and address it appropriately. We will also need to perform regular wound care to keep the area clean and promote healing. Regarding your niece’s birthday, it’s too early to say definitively whether you’ll be able to attend. However, my goal is to get you well enough to resume your normal activities as soon as possible. I will keep you informed of your progress every step of the way. I’m going to have my nurse draw blood for the complete blood count and kidney function tests now. Then, we'll schedule the wound culture and vascular study. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just…get it done. And please, be gentle. I’m an old woman, you know. Just get it fixed, Doctor. That’s all I ask. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I assure you, I will proceed with the utmost care and gentleness. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the procedure. We will work together to get this resolved.
