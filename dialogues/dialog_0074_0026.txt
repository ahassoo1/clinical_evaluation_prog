DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about being awfully tired. Just… so tired. Seems to come and go, but when it hits, I can barely lift a cup of tea. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers? Not good numbers, he said. Something about my muscles? Honestly, these things… they just don’t tell you things plainly, do they?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Oitker. It can be confusing when medical results aren’t explained clearly. We will certainly get to the bottom of those “numbers” together. So, you're experiencing fatigue – a significant tiredness that comes and goes, and is impacting your ability to do everyday things. Could you tell me a little more about when this fatigue started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That’s a tricky one. Seems like… well, a while now. Maybe last year? Or the year before? Everything just… blurs together after a bit, you know? I used to be so active, always puttering about. Now… well, now I mostly sit. My husband, Thomas, does most of the heavy lifting, bless his heart. It’s just… not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Oitker. It’s very common for things to feel less distinct as time goes on. And it sounds like this fatigue has gradually come on, and is affecting your ability to maintain your usual activity level. When you say “fatigue”, can you describe how you feel when you’re tired?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just sleepy, Doctor. Sleepy is easy. This is… like my bones are full of lead. Everything aches. And I just… have no strength. Like trying to push a boulder up a hill. Even simple things, you know? Getting up from a chair, carrying a plate… it feels like a huge effort. It’s not a pleasant feeling, that’s for sure. And sometimes my muscles feel… sore? Like I’ve been working out, but I haven't.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Ms. Oitker. So, it’s not just a feeling of needing sleep, but a deep achiness, a lack of strength, and muscle soreness even without exertion. Now, thinking about other things going on in your body, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and muscle soreness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. Well, my hands get a bit shaky sometimes. Not terribly, but enough to spill a bit of tea now and then. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful, if I’m honest. Thomas gets after me about it. Says I leave things all over the place. But that's probably just old age, isn't it? Everything goes with getting old. Oh, and I suppose my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t crave much these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Oitker. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even things that might seem small. The shakiness, forgetfulness, and decreased appetite are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I see here in your chart your height is 150 centimeters and your weight is 108 pounds. Has there been any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, my. You keep such good records! Well, I suppose I have lost a little weight. Thomas says so, anyway. He’s always commenting on my portions. “Ardelle, you’re not eating enough!” he says. But it’s not like I’m trying to lose weight. I just… don’t feel hungry. Maybe a few pounds, but nothing drastic. It’s not like I'm wasting away, you know.
DOCTOR: A few pounds of unintentional weight loss, even if not drastic, is still important information. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago. Had it taken out. And my arthritis, of course. It flares up now and then, mostly in my hands and knees. That’s why I’m always complaining about them. Other than that… nothing major, I don't think. Old age comes with a few aches and pains, you know. Nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix… usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of gallbladder removal and arthritis in your hands and knees. Do you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a question. Let me think… it was… quite a while ago. Before Thomas and I moved to this town, certainly. We’ve been here… oh, goodness… almost twenty years now. So… more than twenty years ago. Maybe thirty? I'm terrible with dates, honestly. Everything just seems to blur together after a while. I remember it was a very hot summer… Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Oitker. A rough estimate is perfectly fine. So, more than twenty years ago. And you mentioned your arthritis. Are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take a little pill every morning. A white one. Can't remember the name of it, though. Thomas handles the pills, mostly. He keeps them all organized. I just take what he gives me. Something for the pain, you know. And sometimes, when it’s really bad, I take another one. A yellow one. But honestly, they don't seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking a white pill and a yellow pill for your arthritis, though you’re unsure of the names. And they aren’t providing as much relief as they used to. We'll try to get the names of those pills shortly. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I think. A long time ago. And… oh! I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. Had to have a cast. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty careful, you know. Don't like hospitals much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist that was treated with a cast. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Family… Thomas always says I don’t pay enough attention to that sort of thing. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think. Something about it getting too big. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. And arthritis, of course. Everyone in my family seemed to have arthritis. It's probably why I have it, you know. Runs in the blood, they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and arthritis. That is helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean by that, dear? I mostly stay at home, you know. Read a bit, watch television… Thomas and I used to go dancing, but my arthritis makes that difficult now. I used to be a commercial diver, you know, but that was a long time ago. Now, I don't do much physical work. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: A commercial diver! That’s quite a career, Ms. Oitker. I’m impressed. So, you’ve retired from that profession and now lead a quieter lifestyle, mostly at home. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Thomas used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but he gave that up a few years back. Doctor said it wasn't good for his stomach. We mostly drink tea, you know. Lots and lots of tea. Earl Grey, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Oitker. No smoking and limited alcohol consumption. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a little girl. My throat swelled up, I remember. Other than that… not really. I can eat most anything. Thomas always says I have an iron stomach. I don't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that, you know. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. That was very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Go right ahead. I suppose I should expect that. It's probably a good idea. Just don't poke too much, alright? My bones are a bit achy, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do notice a slightly diminished sound in some areas. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing does sound a little shallow. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little low at 110/70, and your pulse is 68 and regular. Now, I'd like to take a look at your hands and wrists. I see some swelling and redness in your knuckles, consistent with arthritis. Your range of motion is somewhat limited. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but otherwise normal. Okay, Ms. Oitker. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the examination, there are several things that could be contributing to your fatigue. The diminished heart sounds, low blood pressure and shallowness of breath is concerning. We will need to order some blood work to investigate further. I’d also like to check your vitamin D and B12 levels. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds awfully complicated, dear. Blood work… I don't like needles. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. If it will help me figure out what’s wrong, then I suppose I should. Vitamin D and… B12? What’s that got to do with being tired? But if you say it’s important… yes, alright. Just… please be quick with the needles. And tell me what all those numbers mean afterwards, alright? I don't want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. We’ll be as quick as possible with the blood work, and I promise to explain all the results clearly. Vitamin D and B12 deficiencies can both contribute to fatigue and muscle weakness. The blood tests will also help us rule out other possibilities, such as anemia or thyroid problems. I’m going to write the orders for the lab now. The lab is just down the hall, and the staff there are very good. They'll take excellent care of you. After the blood work is done, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Before I finalize the order, are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Thomas sometimes gives me a little something for my aching joints. Something from the health food store, I think. Glucosamine, maybe? And Chondroitin? Something like that. He says it’s good for the arthritis. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little bit of melatonin. Just a small dose, you know? Helps me drift off. Other than that… not much. Mostly just tea.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Oitker. It’s important to know everything you are taking, even over-the-counter medications and supplements, as they can sometimes interact with each other or with prescription drugs. I’ll add those to your chart. Alright, I've submitted the lab order. The staff will call you when they are ready for you. Do you have any questions for me before you head over?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, dear. You've explained everything very clearly. Just... please remember what I said about the needles. And don't forget to tell me what all those numbers mean afterwards. It's awfully confusing, all that medical talk. I just want to feel like myself again. And maybe be able to lift a cup of tea without getting all winded. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Oitker. We'll take our time and go through everything together. I promise to explain the results in plain English, and we’ll work together to get you feeling like yourself again. And lifting that cup of tea without getting winded – that's a perfectly reasonable goal, and one we’ll strive for. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Oitker. Please don’t hesitate to let the staff know if you need any assistance.
