DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Thank you. Well, it’s… family, mostly. My mother, she… she had some bad things. Heart trouble, and then… other things. And my brother, he’s not doing so good either. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Family history, right. Important, I suppose. Though a lot of people worry too much about what their relatives had. It doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get the same thing. But, okay. Let’s start with your mother. What kind of heart trouble did she have, specifically?
PATIENT: Um… It was… she had to go to the hospital a lot. They said something about… her heart being big? And then she got very tired. Just… very tired. She couldn’t walk much at the end. I don’t know the name of it, sorry. My sister was always the one who asked the doctors questions. I just… drove her.
DOCTOR: “Big heart.” Right. That could mean a number of things. Cardiomyopathy, heart failure… it's vague. And the tiredness is, well, a symptom of everything. Okay. And your brother?
PATIENT: He… He has… trouble with his legs. They swell up. And he gets short of breath easy. He says it hurts to walk. He’s only… sixty, you know? Still young. He’s been to the doctor a few times, but… they don’t seem to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the legs and shortness of breath… could be a lot of things. Fluid retention, circulation problems… is he on any medications for it?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. He doesn’t really… talk about it much. He just… complains. Says the doctors keep sending him home and telling him to “walk it off.” He lives in… Montana. Far away. I don’t see him often. I worry, that's all. I just… want to make sure I don't end up like them.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, worrying won't help. Let's focus on you, Mr. Schwer. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Not really… no. Not that I’ve noticed. I get a little winded sometimes when I climb the stairs, but… I’m 73, you know? I guess that’s just getting old. I walk a little bit every day, just around the block. No pain, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No, not that I can see. Maybe a little… sometimes at the end of the day? But I thought that was just… from being on my feet too long. I used to be a salesman, you know? Lots of walking. I’m retired now, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes… a little discomfort, maybe? Like… a pressure, right in the middle of my chest. But it doesn't last long. Comes and goes. I thought it was just… indigestion. I eat a lot of… spicy food.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. You said you're concerned about your family history. I understand that. However, you're describing very vague symptoms, and it’s difficult to determine anything concrete at this point. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. A physical exam… alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just… want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just lie down on the table, please. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay. Here.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breathing sounds a bit labored. No significant edema present. Peripheral pulses are present, but a little weak. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately concerning, but the murmur and elevated blood pressure warrant further investigation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I can take most things, I think. My wife… she was the one with all the allergies. Penicillin, some kinds of fruit… I always had to remember what she couldn’t have. I don’t have that problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my knees. They get achy sometimes. Something my pharmacist recommended. It's… glucosamine, I think? And chondroitin. Something like that. Helps a little, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your family history, your slightly elevated blood pressure, and the heart murmur, I’d like to order a few tests just to get a clearer picture of your cardiovascular health. We’ll do a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest x-ray to look at your lungs and heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes. That sounds… thorough. Whatever you think is best, doctor. Just… please explain the results to me when you get them? I don't understand a lot of the medical… words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. We’ll go over everything in detail. I'll also give you a referral to a cardiologist, just for a second opinion. They’re the specialists, and can provide a more in-depth assessment of your heart health. I want to be cautious, especially with your family history. I’m going to print out the lab requisition and a referral form for you. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can schedule an appointment with the cardiologist. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… is that… bad? Is something seriously wrong? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to… end up like my mother. That's all.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Schwer. It’s simply a precaution. A cardiologist specializes in heart health, and can provide a more thorough evaluation. We’re just being thorough, given your family history and the murmur I detected. It doesn't automatically mean there's something seriously wrong. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially at your age. Here are the forms. The lab is just down the hall, and you can schedule the cardiologist appointment at your convenience. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That gives me time to… think. Thank you, doctor. For explaining everything. I appreciate it. I still worry, but… I feel a little better knowing you’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. That’s what I’m here for. Just remember to schedule the tests and the cardiologist appointment as soon as possible. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness in the meantime, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's all. Thank you again, doctor. I'll schedule everything right away. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day, Mr. Schwer.
