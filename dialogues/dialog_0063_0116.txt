DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Or… is it Genette?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor… Jules, is it? Yes, Genette is fine. Though, my memory isn't what it used to be, you see. It's been… a long time since anyone asked my name directly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Time does march on. Now, you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. It wakes me up, it does. Feels like… well, like a knot tightening up, and it just hurts. I’ve had it for… a good while now, I suppose. Longer than I can rightly say. It comes and goes, but lately it's been more often than not.
DOCTOR: Cramping, you say. And how long have these “cramps” been occurring, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Approximately… That's a hard one. Let me think… It feels like… years, certainly. But I can't say exactly how many. Maybe five? Ten? It's hard when you get… older. Things sort of blur together, you know. I just know it’s been long enough that I'm tired of it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… common at your age, yes. Are these cramps constant throughout the day, or solely at night?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not during the day. Mostly when I’m trying to sleep. Though, sometimes if I’m sitting for too long… I might get a little twinge, but nothing like the nighttime ones. It’s really the waking up that’s the trouble. It scares me sometimes, it does. A sharp pain like that… Makes you wonder.
DOCTOR: And you've not sought any treatment for this before?
PATIENT: Treatment…? Well, not exactly. My… husband, God rest his soul, used to rub my legs with some sort of cream, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don’t even remember what was in the cream. It helped a little, maybe. But it wasn't something I kept up with after… well, after he was gone. I mostly just try to tough it out. I didn’t want to bother anyone with old-lady troubles, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not a one. I try to stay away from those things if I can. Always thought too many pills were worse than whatever ailed you. Just a bit of tea now and then for a good night’s sleep… though it doesn’t seem to be helping much lately. I haven't needed to go to doctors much in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I don't think so. I used to get a bit of a rash if I touched poison ivy as a girl, but that was ages ago! I haven't come across anything in recent memory that bothered me. I'm not much for fancy foods or anything, mostly just simple things. Not a fussy eater, never have been. Does that help? I'm trying to recall anything significant, but… it's like looking through fog.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that's a question. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her joints, I suppose. Arthritis, maybe? I never paid much attention to it, to be honest. She didn't complain much. And my father… he was a strong, healthy man. Worked on the water his whole life. No real illnesses, as far as I recall. We weren't ones for keeping records of such things, you see. More concerned with getting the work done. I have a brother, but we haven't spoken in years. I wouldn't know what ails him. Does that… suffice?
DOCTOR: And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness, no! Heavens no. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and smoking… well, that’s just a nasty habit. And those other things… I wouldn’t know where to even begin. A simple life, you see. Tea and quiet evenings… that’s all I ever needed. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without my legs waking me up. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll excuse me, I'll need to perform a brief examination of your legs. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. It might take me a moment to get up there… these old bones aren't what they used to be. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. There is some mild tenderness in the calf muscles bilaterally. Range of motion is within normal limits, but slightly limited due to age-related stiffness. No obvious signs of swelling or inflammation. It appears to be muscle strain, likely exacerbated by age.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Muscle strain, you say? Is that… serious? And what does that mean? Will it go away on its own, or will I need… something done? I just want to be able to sleep through the night, doctor. It’s just so tiring being woken up by the pain. Is there anything you can prescribe to help me rest?
DOCTOR: It's not a particularly serious condition, Ms. Bilstein, but it is… inconvenient. I can prescribe a mild muscle relaxant to be taken before bedtime. However, I would strongly advise you to incorporate regular, gentle stretching exercises into your daily routine. And ensure adequate hydration. Dehydration can exacerbate muscle cramping. Here you are. Take as directed. And if the pain persists, you can return for a further evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. A muscle relaxant. Thank you, doctor. Stretching, you say? I haven’t stretched in… goodness knows how long. I’ll try my best. And hydration… yes, I suppose I do neglect my water sometimes. Is there a particular… type of stretch you recommend? And how often should I be doing these? I don’t want to make it worse, you see. I'm not very nimble these days.
DOCTOR: Simple calf stretches, Ms. Bilstein. Stand facing a wall, place one foot slightly behind the other, and lean forward, keeping your back straight. You should feel a gentle pull in your calf muscle. Hold for 20-30 seconds, and repeat several times on each leg. Do this twice daily. And frankly, if it’s too difficult, don't bother. It’s not a life-or-death situation. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Facing the wall… hold for 20 seconds. Twice a day. I think I can manage that. No, I don’t think so, doctor. That’s… very helpful. I appreciate your time. Thank you for the prescription and your advice. I hope it helps me get a good night’s sleep. Would it be alright if I asked where the nearest pharmacy is? I don’t drive anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: There’s a pharmacy just down the street, a ten-minute walk. I suggest you ask someone for directions. And frankly, Ms. Bilstein, I have other patients waiting. I trust you can manage from here. Good day. .
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. Good day to you too. .
