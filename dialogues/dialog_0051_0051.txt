DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? My son, he said I really ought to come in and get my… blood type written down somewhere. Something about needing it, just in case. He’s a worrier, that boy. I just… want to know what it is, I suppose. For peace of mind, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you and your son, Darl. Knowing your blood type is good information to have. It can be helpful in a number of situations. And it’s perfectly alright if your memory isn’t as sharp as it once was – it happens to the best of us. So, just to clarify, the main reason for your visit today is to determine your blood type?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Just… what is my blood type? I think I remember something about A, B, and O… and maybe a plus or a minus? But honestly, it’s all a bit of a fog. I used to be so good with details… working as a rigger, you had to be. But that was a long time ago. Do you need me to… tell you anything? Like, where I was born or something?
DOCTOR: No need to worry about details right now, Darl. We'll get there. Knowing your birthplace can sometimes be helpful, but it’s not crucial at this stage. Let’s focus on getting your blood type determined first. We'll just need a quick blood draw to do that. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: A blood draw, yes… Oh dear. I don’t love needles, I must confess. It’s not that I’m afraid, exactly… it just makes me a little lightheaded sometimes. Is it very much blood? And will it hurt a lot? I’ve always had thin veins, so they usually poke around a bit. Is there anything I should do beforehand? I had a little coffee this morning, is that alright?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be a bit apprehensive, Darl. Many people aren’t fond of needles. We'll take it slow and steady. It’s only a small amount of blood, just enough for the test. And we have experienced phlebotomists who are very skilled at finding veins, so hopefully it won’t be a long search. Coffee is fine; it shouldn’t interfere with the test. As for discomfort, it’s usually a quick pinch, and then it’s over before you know it. We can also have you lie down during the draw if that would make you more comfortable. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's kind of you to ask. Lying down… yes, I think that might be best. I always feel a bit safer when I’m not upright. And… a quick pinch, you say? Not a lot of poking around? That’s good. My son always worries when he sees me getting blood work done. He thinks I’ll faint, the silly boy. He’s a good boy, though. Is there anything I need to do, besides lie down? Like, should I tense my arm or something?
DOCTOR: Good, we can absolutely have you lie down. And no, you don’t need to tense your arm, just relax it as much as possible. Completely relaxed is best. We’ll use a tourniquet to help find the vein, and then the phlebotomist will do the rest. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to bandages, alcohol, or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any trouble with bandages before. And latex… I used to wear gloves when I was rigging, but that was ages ago. I don’t recall any reaction to them. But… I do get a bit itchy sometimes, just generally. Not from anything specific, I just have sensitive skin. Is that something I should mention? Oh, and my insurance… I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Sensitive skin is good to know, Darl. We'll be sure to use hypoallergenic bandages just to be safe. And yes, having your private insurance information is helpful. Alright, let’s get you comfortable on the examination table. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in shortly. While we wait, perhaps you could tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… that’s a long story. I’ve lived a long life, you know. I used to be very strong, very active. Rigging is hard work, hauling ropes and climbing… But as I got older, things started to ache. My knees, mostly. And my back. I saw a doctor about it years ago, they said it was arthritis. Nothing too serious, just old age. I don’t really take any medication regularly, except for a little something for my blood pressure now and then. I try to stay active, though. Walking is good for me. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit when my son was born. That must be… oh, goodness, over fifty years ago now. Is that what you wanted to know? I’m rambling again, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Darl. You're not rambling. This is all very helpful information. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full life, and it’s wonderful that you’re still staying active. So, to summarize: arthritis in your knees and back, some medication for blood pressure, and a history of smoking that you've thankfully stopped. Do you recall what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… now that’s a tricky one. My son handles most of my medications these days. He’s very organized, that boy. Let me see… it's a little white pill… I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘B’? Oh dear, I really can’t remember. I take it every morning with my breakfast. It helps keep my head from swimming, you know. Maybe if my son were here, he could tell you. He worries so much about these things. I just… try to keep up with it all, but it’s difficult. Is it important? Do you need to know exactly what it is? Perhaps we can call him?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Darl, don’t worry about it. It’s helpful to know you're on something for your blood pressure. We can certainly check your electronic health record to see what medication you’re prescribed. That’s what it’s there for. We don’t need to call your son just yet. Before we do that, are there any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any trouble with food allergies, or anything like that. I used to be around dust a lot when I was rigging, but that didn’t bother me. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to any medication, either. But… I do get a bit itchy sometimes, like I said before. Just generally. And I have sensitive skin, so certain fabrics can irritate me. Nothing serious, though. Mostly just a little discomfort. Is that what you mean by allergies? Or are you asking about something more… specific? I get confused easily these days.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Darl. You’re not confused at all. Sensitive skin and occasional itchiness are good to know. It sounds like you don't have any true allergies that would cause a severe reaction, which is good. Now, just to complete the picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh dear. Let me see. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young woman. That was… oh, goodness, over sixty years ago now. And… I think I had a small cyst removed from my wrist once, but that was a very minor procedure. Nothing major. And… I had a hip replacement about ten years ago. That was… a bit rough, but it helped a lot. It’s still a bit sore sometimes, especially when the weather is cold. Is that what you needed to know? I’m rambling again, aren’t I? I always get long-winded when I start thinking about the past.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Darl. This is all very helpful. So, to summarize: appendectomy long ago, a minor cyst removal, and a hip replacement about ten years ago. Do you recall any complications from any of those surgeries?
PATIENT: Complications… Let me see. The appendix one was so long ago, I barely remember. I was young and healthy then, so it went smoothly, I think. The cyst removal was so minor, there wasn’t really any room for complications. But the hip replacement… that was a bit trickier. I had a bit of trouble with infection afterwards, but the doctors managed to clear it up with antibiotics. It took a while to recover, and I needed a lot of physical therapy. But eventually, I got back on my feet. It’s still a bit sore sometimes, especially in cold weather, like I said before. But overall, it was a success. I’m grateful for that. Is that what you needed to know? I hope I’m not boring you with all these details.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Darl, you're not boring me. It's important to have a complete picture of your medical history, and you're providing that beautifully. So, to recap: history of arthritis, blood pressure medication, appendectomy, minor cyst removal, and a hip replacement with a post-operative infection that was successfully treated. Now, before we get to the physical examination, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, passed away a long time ago. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. But I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. I wasn’t very close to my relatives, and we never really talked about medical history. I have a son, of course, but he's very healthy, thankfully. He doesn’t have any major medical problems, as far as I know. He’s very active, always hiking and biking. I worry about him sometimes, but he takes good care of himself. Is that what you wanted to know? I’m not very good with remembering these things, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s common to not have a detailed family history, especially as time passes. Knowing that your mother had heart trouble and your father had diabetes is helpful. And it's wonderful to hear your son is healthy and active. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I used to smoke, a long time ago. When I was younger, a lot of people smoked, you see. But I quit when my son was born. Over fifty years ago now. It was the best thing I ever did. I haven’t touched a cigarette since. My son would be very upset if I did. He’s always telling me to take care of my health. He’s a good boy, very concerned. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that as well. The doctor told me it was better for my blood pressure, you see. I mostly drink water now. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I’m not boring you with all these details.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Darl. This is all very helpful. It’s excellent that you quit smoking so long ago, and that you've reduced your alcohol intake. It sounds like you're very conscientious about your health. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you currently work, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm retired now. I used to be a rigger, you see. A very physical job, hauling ropes and climbing… But I haven’t done that in years. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you see. I mostly stay at home now, reading and gardening. I like to keep busy, but I don't do anything too strenuous. My son helps me with the heavy lifting, you see. He’s very good to me. It’s nice to have someone to help. I used to travel a lot with my husband, but he passed away a long time ago. I haven’t done much traveling since then. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I’m not rambling again. I always get long-winded when I start thinking about the past.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Darl, you’re not rambling. It sounds like you’ve had a full and interesting life, and now you’re enjoying a well-deserved retirement. Alright, now that I have a good understanding of your medical history and lifestyle, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Just… don’t poke around too much, if you don’t mind. My old bones are a bit sensitive, you see. And… I get a little lightheaded sometimes, so if I start to feel faint, please let me know. I think lying down would be best, if that’s alright. Is that okay? Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. We'll take it very slowly and gently. We’ll definitely keep you lying down, and I’ll let you know exactly what I'm doing every step of the way. If you feel any discomfort or lightheadedness, please tell me immediately. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Now, just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, and your pulse is 76. A little elevated, but not too concerning given your history. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. It’s a little tender, but nothing alarming. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. A little bit of swelling in your ankles, but nothing significant. Everything seems within normal limits, but we'll need to do a blood test to get a more detailed picture. That will also help us determine your blood type.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t surprise me, to be honest. I worry a lot, you see. And tender abdomen… that’s probably just old age. I’m not very strong anymore, you see. Swelling in the ankles… that’s probably just from sitting too much. I don’t get out much, you see. A blood test… oh dear. Another needle? Is it very much blood this time? I really don’t love needles, you know. But… if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. Just… please be gentle. And… could I hold your hand while you do it? I get a little nervous, you see. It’s silly, I know, but it would help calm me down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Darl. Absolutely. It's not silly at all. It's perfectly alright to be nervous, and I'm happy to hold your hand. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it won't take long. It’s only a small amount of blood, just enough for the tests. We'll get this done quickly and gently. While the phlebotomist is getting ready, I'll quickly review the tests we'll be running: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a blood type and Rh factor test. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests… Complete blood count… metabolic panel… Rh factor… It sounds very complicated. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand any of that. I just want to know what is my blood type, you see. Is that too much to ask? I don’t need to know all the details, just… what type of blood do I have? Is it A, B, or O? And… plus or minus? Is that right? I’m getting so confused. And… will the results take long to come back? I don’t like waiting, you see. It makes me worry even more. Oh, and… will it hurt? I know I keep asking that, but… I really don’t like needles. Is there anything I can do to make it less painful? I’m sorry, I’m being such a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Darl. It's perfectly alright to ask questions, and it's my job to explain everything clearly. You're right, you just want to know your blood type, and that's what we'll focus on. The complete blood count and metabolic panel are just routine tests to get a general picture of your health. They help us make sure everything is functioning properly. But your blood type is the most important thing right now. The tests shouldn't take long to come back, usually within a few hours. And the blood draw itself shouldn't hurt much, just a quick pinch. We’ll make sure you're comfortable, and I'll be right here with you the whole time. To make it less painful, try to relax your arm, and breathe deeply. Focusing on your breathing can help distract you from the pinch. And remember, I'm right here. Now, let’s get this done quickly. Just relax, breathe deeply, and try not to tense up.
PATIENT: Oh alright. Breathe deeply… relax… I really don’t like needles, you know. It’s silly, I know, but… I always get so nervous. And… I get lightheaded sometimes, so if I start to feel faint, please let me know. And… could you talk to me while you do it? Just… tell me about your day, or something. Anything to distract me. Just… please be gentle. Here we go… I think I’m ready. Or… as ready as I’ll ever be.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Darl. Just breathe deeply. It’s been a fairly quiet day at the clinic, thankfully. A lot of routine check-ups, a few minor illnesses… nothing too concerning. We had a new patient come in this morning, a young couple expecting their first child. It’s always lovely to see new life come into the world. The weather has been quite pleasant today, a bit warmer than usual for August. The roses in my garden are blooming beautifully right now, I should probably take some time to prune them later this afternoon. You’re doing a wonderful job. Just relax your arm, and breathe deeply. Almost done… just a few more seconds… …And there we go. All finished. You did so well, Darl. Just keep that pressure on it for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… it’s over? That wasn’t so bad, was it? It felt… quick. And… you were very gentle, Doctor. Thank you. I feel a little lightheaded, but I think that’s just from the relief. And… a little shaky. It’s just… needles. I never could stand them. But… you were very kind, Doctor. Thank you for holding my hand and talking to me. It helped a lot. Now… what happens now? Do we have to wait a long time for the results? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I just want to know what my blood type is, you see. Is that too much to ask? And… could I have a glass of water, please? I’m a little thirsty. And… perhaps a biscuit? Just a little something to calm my nerves. Oh, and… thank you again, Doctor. You were very kind.
DOCTOR: You did wonderfully, Darl, truly. And yes, you deserve a biscuit and a glass of water. I’ll have the nurse bring those right over. The results shouldn’t take too long, perhaps 30-45 minutes. I’ll check in with the lab as soon as possible. In the meantime, just relax and try to rest. We can go over the results together when they come back, and I’ll explain everything clearly. Let me check on the results quickly. Good news, Darl! The results are back. Your blood type is A positive. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A positive… Oh! A positive… That’s… good, isn’t it? What does that mean, exactly? I think I remember something about different types being more common than others… And… positive means I don’t have that… negative thing, right? Oh dear, I’m getting confused again. But… A positive. That’s good. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I was so worried about this, you see. And… you made it so much easier. Now… what do I do with this information? Do I need to tell anyone? My son, perhaps? He was the one who worried about this, you see. Or… do I just keep it somewhere safe, in case of an emergency? Oh dear, I’m getting confused again.
DOCTOR: Yes, A positive is a very common blood type, so that’s good. And you’re right, positive means you do have the Rh factor, which is also good. It’s wonderful that you know your blood type now. It’s helpful information to have on hand in case of an emergency, such as an accident or if you ever need a blood transfusion. Yes, it’s a good idea to tell your son. He’ll be relieved to know you’ve gotten it checked, and he’ll appreciate having the information. You can simply write it down on a card and keep it with your important documents. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been so kind and patient, Doctor. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I was so worried about this, you see. And… you made it so much easier. I think I’ll just rest for a little while now. And… I’ll be sure to tell my son. He’ll be very relieved. And… I’ll write it down somewhere safe, just in case. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a very good doctor. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Darl. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care of yourself and have a wonderful day.
