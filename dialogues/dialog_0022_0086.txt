DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just the results, please. I'm pretty busy, so if we can just jump straight to that, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you’d like to discuss the results of your recent tests. Just one moment while I pull them up on the computer. Okay, I have everything here. Before we go through them, could you remind me which tests we were discussing?
PATIENT: The blood work and… the one where I had to breathe into the tube? That’s it. I don’t remember the official names, sorry. Just those two.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Kahrin. That’s perfectly alright. The blood work and the spirometry – that’s the breathing test. Let’s start with the blood work. Overall, things look pretty good. Your complete blood count was within normal limits – your red and white blood cell counts are healthy, hemoglobin and hematocrit are good. Your basic metabolic panel also looks normal – electrolytes, kidney function, and glucose are all within the expected range. We did check your Vitamin D levels, and those are a little low – 28 ng/mL. We generally like to see those above 30. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Low Vitamin D, got it. Is that a big deal? I don’t really know what any of that means, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It's good you asked. Low Vitamin D is pretty common, especially if you don’t get a lot of sun exposure or don’t consume many Vitamin D-rich foods. It can sometimes cause fatigue, muscle aches, or even mood changes, but often people don't have any noticeable symptoms. It’s usually easily corrected with a supplement. We can discuss dosage options in a bit. Now, let's move on to the spirometry, the breathing test. Your FEV1 – that’s the amount of air you can forcibly exhale in one second – was a little lower than expected, at 78% of predicted. Your FVC – that's the total amount of air you can exhale – was also slightly reduced, at 82% of predicted. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or frequent respiratory infections?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the occasional cold, like everyone else, but nothing major. Never been diagnosed with anything like asthma. I do a lot of hiking, so I figured my lungs were pretty good. Is it…bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about the hiking. It’s not necessarily bad, but it does warrant some further investigation. Reduced lung function can be caused by a number of things – it’s not always something serious. It could be something as simple as recent viral illness, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your history and these results, I’d like to discuss a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… okay. I guess so. Is there any radiation or anything? I’ve heard things about that. And how long will it take? I really don’t have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. You’re right to be mindful of radiation exposure. The amount of radiation from a single chest X-ray is very small – it's equivalent to about ten days of natural background radiation. It's considered very safe, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis generally outweigh the minimal risk. The X-ray itself only takes a few minutes – maybe five minutes total, including positioning. Then the radiologist will review the images, and we should have the results back within 24-48 hours. We can get you scheduled for one right away. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, if it’s really that little radiation, then yeah, let’s do it. Get it over with. And can I still go hiking tomorrow? I have a group planned.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, absolutely. You can absolutely still go hiking tomorrow. There are no restrictions after a chest X-ray. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for a chest X-ray now, in the radiology department, which is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will explain the procedure to you in detail. They'll need you to remove any jewelry around your neck and chest. Here’s a referral slip for the radiology department. Do you have any questions before I send you over there?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… get it done, get the results, and hopefully it’s nothing. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me wait around all day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kahrin. I understand wanting to get things sorted out quickly. We’ll get those results back to you as soon as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the results review. Have a good hike tomorrow, and please feel free to reach out if anything concerns you. .
