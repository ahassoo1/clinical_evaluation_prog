DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. Like someone flipped a switch. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don’t keep up with these things. My husband usually handles all that. He’s not here today, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden tiredness and some lab results that need looking into. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the details – that’s what I’m here for. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like just being a bit sleepy, you understand? It’s… a weight. A heavy weight pressing down on me. And everything aches. My arms, my legs… even my jaw feels tired sometimes. It comes on quick, then it’s just… hard to do anything. I mostly just have to lie down. It's been happening for... oh, goodness, a few months now, I suppose. Longer, maybe? Time just slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does slip away. A heavy weight and aches all over… that sounds really draining. A few months, okay. And does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, dear. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. Sometimes it's after I've been doing something, like gardening, but other times it comes on when I haven’t done anything at all. My husband says I should be resting more, but I don’t sit still for long, never have. Always been a busybody, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. So it doesn’t seem to be consistently linked to activity. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and aches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! Sometimes my urine is a bit… dark. A funny color, you know? Not bright, just… not the usual pale yellow. And I’ve been a little more clumsy lately. Dropped a plate just last week. My husband made quite a fuss, said I was being careless. Honestly, men.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and some clumsiness… okay. That's helpful. Just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, weight loss, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. I usually run a bit cool, to be honest. Weight loss… well, I haven’t been trying to lose weight. I eat a good meal, always have. Maybe a little less appetite lately, now that you mention it, but I put that down to just… not feeling well. Everything tastes a bit bland, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, possible slight decrease in appetite and things tasting bland. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And something for my arthritis in my hands. It's a pink one, I think. Honestly, I leave all that to my husband. He sorts everything out. Allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t go in for all those fancy foods anyway. Plain rice and lentils are good enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and arthritis. We’ll get the specifics from the pharmacy records, don’t worry. No known allergies, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your hands and feet. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. If you think it’s necessary. Just try not to poke too much, my joints aren’t what they used to be. And don’t be surprised if I flinch a bit, everything feels so sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes... Reflexes are a little bit diminished, which isn’t necessarily a cause for concern at your age, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let me just take a look at your hands... A little bit of swelling and tenderness in your knuckles, consistent with arthritis. And your skin feels a little dry. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to push against my hand while I try to resist. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Muscle strength… I used to be quite strong, you know. Did a lot of gardening, heavy lifting. But it's not like it used to be. Just be gentle, dear, please. Don't want to pull anything. I get a bit of a twinge in my shoulder sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me… and push against my hand like you’re trying to lift something. Okay, that’s good. And now your legs… Just try to push your leg against my hand like you’re trying to straighten it. Okay, your muscle strength is a little weaker than I’d expect, in both your arms and legs. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The muscle weakness, tiredness, dark urine, and the changes in your appetite could point to several things, including a possible vitamin deficiency, a problem with your kidneys, or even a thyroid issue. To figure out what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests… sounds serious, doesn’t it? But alright, dear, if you think it’s necessary. Just try not to poke too much. And don’t be surprised if I wince a bit. I don’t like needles. My husband usually comes with me for these things, but he had a meeting today. Honestly, I don't know how I'll manage all this on my own.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we’ll take it one step at a time. It’s better to figure out what’s going on so we can get you feeling better. And I promise I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The phlebotomist is very good; they are used to patients who don’t like needles. I’ll write the order for the blood tests now. It will be a standard panel, and we'll also add a Vitamin D level and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. You’ll need to go to the lab, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. They’ll let you know when the results are back – usually within a few days. In the meantime, could you try to stay well-hydrated?
PATIENT: Hydrated… yes, alright. I do like a nice cup of tea. And try to eat something, you say? Though I don't have much appetite, as I mentioned. Well, I suppose I can try. It's just… all this worry. It makes me feel even more tired. My husband will be furious when he hears about this. He always says I should take better care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s worrying, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. Try not to stress too much, we’ll get to the bottom of this. And yes, a nice cup of tea is a good start. Even if you don’t feel hungry, try to eat something small and nourishing when you can. Soup is a good option, or yogurt. I’m going to write a note for your husband, explaining the tests we’ve ordered and what we’re looking for. That way he’ll be up to date when he gets back. Do you have any questions for me right now before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, a note for my husband, that’s kind of you dear. He does like to be informed. Hmm… questions… let me think. Well, will these tests hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I have a book club meeting next week, and I don’t want to miss it. Mrs. Henderson is making her famous scones, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will feel like a quick pinch, just for a moment. Most people don’t find them very painful. And as for the results, the lab usually gets them back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. So you should know before your book club meeting, definitely. We can discuss them then and make a plan. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, dear. Thank you for being so patient with me. I do get a bit flustered sometimes, you know. And thank you for the note for my husband. He’ll be very pleased. I suppose I should go to the lab then, before I forget. It's just… all this worrying. It makes me so tired.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. Don’t worry about getting flustered – that’s perfectly alright. And please, take your time. And remember, if you feel any new symptoms or anything gets worse, don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll have the nurse print you a requisition form for the lab and the note for your husband. Get to the lab when you’re ready, and we’ll talk soon. Take care.
PATIENT: Alright dear, thank you again. You've been very kind.
