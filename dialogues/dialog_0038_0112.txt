DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom awfully frequently lately. It’s quite disruptive, and I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it. I don’t… I don’t recall ever having this problem before, or at least not this badly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright – these things happen, and there's no need to be embarrassed at all. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "awfully frequently," can you give me a rough idea of how often you're needing to go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like… every hour or two, at least. Sometimes even more often than that. It’s hard to say precisely, because it varies. It's definitely more than usual, I just… I don't keep a log, if that makes sense. It's just… inconvenient, and I'm a bit worried something might be wrong. I don’t recall a specific event that triggered this, either. It just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several times an hour, increasing gradually without a clear trigger. That's helpful to know. And is it just frequent urination, or are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I do feel like I need to go even when I don’t think I have much in my bladder, sometimes. And… occasionally, a bit of a burning sensation. It’s not severe, more like a slight discomfort. I’m also… rather tired, lately, but I attributed that to just being busy. I don't recall anything else particularly noticeable, no. It’s all a bit… vague, if I’m honest. I apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Keoni. It is often vague to begin with. The burning sensation is important, as is the feeling of needing to go even with little in your bladder. And the tiredness, while it could be from being busy, we'll keep that on our radar. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… hmm. Now that you mention it, perhaps it’s a little darker than usual. Not dramatically, but… yes, a slightly deeper yellow, I suppose. I haven't noticed any blood, or anything like that. I… I really don't pay much attention, usually. I apologize again for being so unobservant. It just… doesn't usually occur to me to check. I don't recall any other changes, though.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Keoni, most people don’t routinely examine their urine! The darker colour is good to know, it can point to dehydration, but we need to rule other things out. To help me get a clearer understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… well, it’s not terribly eventful. I was divorced five years ago, if that counts. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. I… I don’t have insurance, so I tend to avoid going to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I don't recall ever being diagnosed with anything significant. My mother had… arthritis, I think, but I don’t know much about it. I don't recall taking any regular medication, either. Does that help? It's all rather… unremarkable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. And it's perfectly okay that it's unremarkable! Knowing there's no major medical history is just as important as knowing there is. No major surgeries, vaccinations up to date, and no current medications – good to know. And just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I’m sometimes a bit sensitive to strong perfumes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? No, I don't recall any true allergies. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything like that. I've never had a rash or difficulty breathing after taking medication, or eating anything specific, either. I apologize if I seem vague, it’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. That’s perfectly alright. No known allergies is good information. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… well, I work as a concierge at a local hotel. It’s a fairly busy job, a lot of standing and walking. I live alone. I try to eat reasonably healthily – lots of fruits and vegetables, not too much processed food. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. I don’t get a great deal of exercise, I’m afraid. I enjoy reading and spending time in my garden when I have the time. I don't recall anything else particularly noteworthy, really. It's a rather quiet existence, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense. Active job, reasonably healthy diet, no smoking, occasional alcohol - that's all positive. And you live alone. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your bowel movements, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s… a bit personal. But yes, alright. I suppose it’s important. What would you like to know? I don’t recall anything unusual, generally. It's… regular, if that makes sense. I don’t have any pain or bleeding. I apologize if this is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It is a bit personal, I understand, and it's perfectly alright to tell me if you'd rather not answer something. You're right to be cautious, and I appreciate you sharing this information. Knowing everything is regular is good to hear. Just one more quick set of questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and checking your blood pressure. Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just the frequent urination, the slight burning sensation, and the tiredness. I occasionally feel a little lightheaded, but I’ve always been prone to that. It's probably just low blood sugar. No, I don't recall anything else particularly bothersome. The physical exam sounds… alright. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: You're not being anxious at all, Keoni. It's perfectly natural to be concerned when something isn't feeling right. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, if you'll just lie back on the examination table, I'll listen to your abdomen and check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright… I'm ready when you are, Doctor. I apologize if I fidget. I'm not very comfortable with medical examinations.
