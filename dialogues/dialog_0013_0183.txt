DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too. I am… tired. Very tired. Always tired, now. It is… not good. The other doctor, he said something about my… insides. My liver, he said. Something is wrong with it, and that makes me feel sleepy all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness is definitely not something to brush off, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. And you mentioned another doctor spoke with you about your liver?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor Abera. He did some… pictures. With the machine. He looked at the pictures and said my liver is… not happy. He sent me here, to you. He said you know about… this tiredness.
DOCTOR: Right, Dr. Abera is excellent. Those "pictures" were likely imaging scans, like an ultrasound or CT scan. He's right to send you my way - I do specialize in figuring out the causes of fatigue, and liver issues can absolutely be a big part of that. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it started… that is… maybe six months? No, more. Seven, maybe eight months. It started slowly. I just… needed more naps. Then more naps. Now… now I sleep almost all day if I could. It is interfering with my work, you know? I make things. With fabric. But I have no energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over about seven or eight months. That’s helpful. And it's definitely impacting your daily life, with your work. You mentioned you make things with fabric - is that a full-time job, or more of a hobby?
PATIENT: It is my job. I make… covers. For chairs, for sofas. I sell them at the market. Always have. My father taught me. But I cannot… concentrate. I make mistakes. I am slow. People… they complain. They say the stitching is bad. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I can see how frustrating that must be, especially with something you take pride in and have learned from your father. It sounds like this isn’t just fatigue, but affecting your ability to do what you love. Now, besides the tiredness and difficulty concentrating, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. My stomach… sometimes it hurts. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And I… I do not have much appetite. I used to enjoy food, very much. Now… I eat only because my wife tells me to. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach discomfort and a decreased appetite. Those are good things to note. Is the stomach discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly… after I eat. Not every time, but most times. It is… a feeling of fullness. Too full, even if I eat very little. And sometimes… a little bit of nausea. Not vomiting, just… like I might.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness quickly and some nausea after eating. That gives us a little more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or the whites of your eyes – any yellowing or itching?
PATIENT: Yellowing? No. My wife would tell me if I looked yellow, she always notices everything. Itching… sometimes my hands feel a little… dry. But I work with fabric all day, so maybe that is the fabric.
DOCTOR: That’s fair – working with fabric could certainly cause some dry hands. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any recent weight loss, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss… yes. A little bit. Not much, but my clothes… they feel looser. My wife says I am looking thinner. I did not try to lose weight. I like to eat! But I haven’t been eating as much, so I suppose it makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. And you’ve mentioned changes in appetite, fatigue, stomach discomfort, and now weight loss… That's quite a bit to consider. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. My wife… she comments on it. She says my feet are puffy in the evenings. I thought it was just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your feet, especially in the evenings. That's another important piece. Alright, Chirag, I think we have a good starting point. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, just to check a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That is fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. But be gentle, please. My bones are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Alright. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, particularly in the upper right area, where your liver is located. It's not drastically so, but it's worth noting. I also see some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Your skin tone looks normal, no yellowing. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your pulse is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily concerning. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but again, not alarming. I'm going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your liver and overall health. These tests will check your liver function, look for any signs of inflammation, and rule out other potential causes for your fatigue. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to feel better, you know? I miss making my covers. I miss having energy. Just… do the tests. And tell me what they mean, please. Not too much doctor talk, if you can. Just… simple.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything in plain language. Here's a form for the lab. They'll take some blood samples from your arm. It shouldn't take long. The results usually come back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to write down a few things we’ve discussed. I want to rule out any serious causes for your symptoms. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam, we need to investigate potential liver problems. We'll see what the blood tests show, and then we’ll develop a plan from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Investigate. That is a good word. I hope they find something. Even if it is not good, I just want to know. Better to know, than to just… be tired. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chirag. And you’re right, knowing is always best. I’ll get the paperwork sorted for you. Here’s a copy of everything we discussed today, as well as the lab form. The lab is just down the hall. Once they’re done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Just… how long will it take to feel better, if you find something? That is what my wife wants to know. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and one I wish I could answer definitively right now. It really depends on what the blood tests show, and what's causing your symptoms. If it's something easily treatable, you might start feeling better within a few weeks. More complex issues may take longer. We’ll know more once we have the results. I promise to keep you and your wife informed every step of the way. We'll work together to get you back to feeling like yourself again. For now, just focus on getting enough rest, and try to stay hydrated.
PATIENT: .
