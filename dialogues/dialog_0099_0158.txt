DOCTOR: Right. Deloris Wrye, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s about a letter. For a… a pet. Yes, a pet. My niece needs it, you see. Something about owning one, legally. Honestly, all this paperwork these days… it’s ridiculous. I just need the doctor to… sign something. Is that alright? I don't really remember why exactly she needs it, but it’s important.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A pet. A little… furry thing. She wants a dog, I think. Or maybe a cat? Honestly, the details are… fuzzy. But she needs a letter saying I approve, or something. It's for… housing, perhaps? Look, I’m not good with these things. My niece handles all the… specifics. Just tell me what needs signing, alright? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I see here—and please correct me if I’m wrong—that your niece, Adebola Wrye, is applying for pet-friendly housing. This document is essentially a verification of your knowledge of her responsible pet ownership… or potential pet ownership, given she doesn't currently have a pet. It asks if you believe she is capable of providing adequate care. It's… unusual to involve a physician in this matter, frankly. But if you’d like me to simply state that I am aware of her intentions and have no reason to believe she would be an irresponsible pet owner, I suppose I can do that. Though I must say, it’s not standard medical practice. Do you understand what I’m asking?
PATIENT: Adebola, yes, that's her! Oh, goodness, “responsible pet ownership”… honestly. Look, she’s a lovely girl, very responsible in other areas. Bills, work, things like that. A pet… well, it’s a new thing for her. But she’s always wanted one. And if I say it's alright... Isn’t that enough? I mean, what do doctors know about pets anyway? Just… say you know she wants one, and you don’t think she’ll let it starve or something. That’s all I need. It’s really quite silly, all this fuss. Do you have the letter ready? I'd like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will state for the record that I, Ledarius Overgaard, am aware of Adebola Wrye’s intent to acquire a pet, and I have no specific medical reason to believe she would be incapable of providing basic animal care. This does not constitute a medical endorsement of pet ownership, naturally. It simply acknowledges her stated intention. Here. If you could just sign and date it… and I do wish people wouldn’t involve physicians in matters so… outside our purview. It sets a rather… unfortunate precedent.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Precedent, indeed. Honestly. There. Happy now? It's all very… bureaucratic, if you ask me. I’m sure Adebola will appreciate it. Just… trying to help family, you know? Can I go now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. And please, encourage your niece to research responsible pet ownership thoroughly. Animals are a significant commitment, not merely a matter of paperwork. Good day.
PATIENT: .
