DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Doctor… Pipkorn, you say? Yes, yes. They told me to come. Something about the… the place I work. The mine. They want me to check if I’m… still good. No problems yet, mind you. But they send me anyway. Waste of time, if you ask me. I been down there a long time. Never had trouble.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your employer is requesting a medical evaluation as part of your continued employment at the mine?
PATIENT: Continued… what? Look, they just said come get checked. Dust and all, you know? Old mine. Lots of dust. Been there longer than you been alive, I reckon. They want to be sure, that's all. Not like I feel sick. I eat my food, sleep my sleep. Strong man, still. Used to be stronger, but… age, eh? What do you need to know exactly? You askin’ about dust?
DOCTOR: Yes, the dust is a primary concern, Mr. Bigger. Prolonged exposure can lead to various respiratory issues. To get a clearer picture, could you describe your work environment in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Respiratory… what now? Look, it’s a mine. Dark. Damp. Dusty. You dig things out of the ground with big machines. Loud. Very loud. Machines everywhere. And dust. Always dust. What else you want to know? It's not like it's a fancy office, you know. It’s a mine. Do you… understand? I move rocks, big rocks, with a machine. That’s what I do. For many, many years. The dust comes with the rocks.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, I understand it is a mine. I simply need to gather some specific details to assess your overall health and any potential risks related to your occupation. Could you tell me approximately how long you’ve been working in the mine?
PATIENT: Hmph. Specific details… You think I keep a calendar down there? Long time. A very long time. Since before you were born, I tell you. Maybe… fifty years? Fifty years I been going down there. Maybe more. I don't know exactly. Started when I was a young man. Strong back then. Still strong, just… older. Fifty years. Is that specific enough for you? You young people always want everything exactly. Life doesn't work like that.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is… considerable. And have you noticed any changes in your breathing over that time?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I breathe! Everyone breathes! I used to run up hills, you know. Now, I walk a little slower. That’s a change. But my breathing… no. It’s… breathing. I get a little winded sometimes, lifting the heavy rocks, but that’s to be expected. Old age, eh? Not like I’m coughing up a lung or something. Everything works… mostly. You makin’ me think about things now. I didn’t notice any changes. Why you asking about changes? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: I’m simply gathering information, Mr. Bigger. It's standard procedure. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Emphysema? Bronchitis? You talkin’ a foreign language now! Look, I go to the doctor when something breaks. A twisted ankle, a bad back… things like that. Never had anything fancy like you’re sayin’. Never needed anything fancy. I’m a strong man! I work hard. Never been sick for long. Old man aches and pains, that’s all. They give me some cream for my back sometimes. That’s it. Never had those… fancy illnesses. What are those even? Are those for weak people?
DOCTOR: They are respiratory illnesses, Mr. Bigger. Conditions that affect the lungs. Given your long-term exposure to dust, it is important to rule them out. Have you ever smoked cigarettes, or been exposed to a significant amount of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Me? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you. My wife… she used to. A little bit. When she was younger. But not around me. I didn’t like it. She stopped a long time ago. A good woman, my wife. Gone now, bless her soul. But she didn’t smoke around me. So, no. No smoke. I breathe dust, not smoke. Is that what you want to know? You keep asking about… problems. I don’t have problems. I work. I eat. I sleep. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination, then. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination. Alright, alright. You young people always want to poke and prod. Fine. Do what you gotta do. Deep breath… like this? . Is that deep enough? It's not easy breathing in that much air all at once when you're old. And don't go poking too hard, eh? I got ribs, you know. Still good ribs, but ribs nonetheless. Hurry it up, will you? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger, take another deep breath… and exhale slowly. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in both lungs, and slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Your oxygen saturation is currently 92%, which is borderline low. Do you experience any shortness of breath at rest, or with exertion?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Diminished… what now? You makin' me nervous, Doctor. Borderline low? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you, I don't feel sick! Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I climb the stairs. Or lift something really heavy. But that’s just… being old! It's not like I can't breathe at all! Is this because of the dust? You think I’m gonna lose my job over some dust? I need that job, you know. I got bills to pay. You’re scaring me, Doctor. Tell me straight. Am I sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I am not saying you are sick, but the findings warrant further investigation. Your history of long-term dust exposure, combined with the wheezing and slightly low oxygen saturation, suggests the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. This is a common condition in individuals with prolonged exposure to irritants like dust. We need to perform a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity and confirm this suspicion. I will also order a chest X-ray to rule out any other underlying issues. This doesn't necessarily mean you will lose your job, but it's important to understand the extent of any potential damage and manage it appropriately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: COPD? Chronic… what did you say? You makin' it sound terrible! Manage… what? Look, I don't understand half those words! I just dig rocks out of the ground! I don't need fancy tests and… and X-rays! What will that do? Will it hurt? I told you, I feel fine! Maybe I just need a good rest. A long vacation. That’s what I need. Not poking and prodding and… and X-rays! Is this gonna cost me a lot of money? My insurance… is it gonna cover it? You think this is because of the mine? They’re tryin’ to get rid of me, aren't they? Old man, not useful anymore… That’s what they’re thinkin’. I don’t want any tests. No. Just tell me I’m alright. Tell me I can go back to work. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please try to remain calm. I understand your concerns, but ignoring these findings will not make them disappear. A pulmonary function test is a simple breathing exercise, it will not hurt, and it will provide valuable information about your lung health. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive and will help rule out any other potential issues. As for the cost, I will have the billing department verify your insurance coverage and inform you of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I assure you, we are not trying to get rid of you. This is about ensuring your health and safety. The mine requires these evaluations for a reason, and it is in your best interest to cooperate. Regardless of the results, we will discuss the best course of action to manage your condition, whether that involves medication, lifestyle changes, or other interventions. We have a responsibility to ensure you can continue working safely and comfortably. I strongly recommend we proceed with the pulmonary function test and chest X-ray today. Can we agree on that?
PATIENT: …Alright. Alright, fine. But you gotta promise me it won’t hurt. And you gotta tell me everything. No fancy words, just… plain English. And if it turns out to be somethin’ bad… you gotta tell me straight. No sugarcoating. I don’t want any surprises. And… and what about my job? You gotta talk to them. Make sure they don't… you know. Get rid of me. Promise me. Do the test. But you gotta promise me those things. I just… I just want to go back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I promise you, the test will not hurt. I will explain everything in plain English, and I will ensure you understand all the results. I will also speak with your employer, if you wish, to discuss any necessary accommodations or restrictions based on the findings. We will work together to ensure your continued safety and well-being. Let’s begin with the pulmonary function test. The technician is ready for you. They will explain the procedure in detail and answer any questions you may have. Try to relax, and breathe normally. We’ll take it one step at a time. I will be here to discuss the results with you once they are available.
