DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. I see you’re 32 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, 32, that’s right. Well, to be frank, I've been… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s just… a lot more than usual, and it's starting to worry me. I’d like to get to the bottom of it, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That’s certainly a good reason to come in, Christen. Increased thirst and hunger can be caused by a number of things, so we’ll want to investigate. To start, could you describe how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it's been… maybe a month, now? Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, it just gradually got worse. At first, I just noticed I was drinking a bit more water with meals. Now… well, now I’m constantly reaching for a glass, and still feeling parched. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over about a month. And you mentioned increased hunger as well – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, to be honest. Not like… cravings, necessarily. Just a feeling of… emptiness. I eat a normal-sized meal, and not long after, I feel like I need to eat again. It's quite frustrating, really. I'm trying not to overeat, but it’s… difficult. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Christen. It’s good you’re aware of it and trying to manage it. Has there been any unintentional weight loss along with this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, and I haven’t changed my diet much at all. But my trousers are a bit looser than they used to be. It’s not a massive amount, perhaps only a couple of pounds, but noticeable nonetheless. It’s not something I actively thought about until you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss along with increased thirst and hunger… that’s helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – more frequent trips to the bathroom, or perhaps a larger volume each time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually! That’s another thing I hadn't really connected until now. I’ve been going to the bathroom far more often. And… yes, larger volumes, I suppose. I just figured I was drinking more water, so that was the cause. It's been happening at night, too, which is disruptive. I wouldn’t say it’s severe, but it’s definitely more than usual. I apologize for not mentioning it sooner.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Christen. It’s very common for symptoms to seem unrelated at first. These details are all important pieces of the puzzle. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother’s side… yes, actually. My grandfather, her father, had diabetes. I believe it was Type 2, but I’m not entirely certain. She always said it ran in the family, but beyond that, I don't know much about it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. That's important to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you experienced any blurry vision, fatigue, or slow-healing sores or cuts?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not that I’ve noticed. Fatigue, perhaps a little. I work quite long hours, so I generally feel tired, but nothing out of the ordinary. And no slow-healing sores or cuts. I did have a small paper cut last week, but it healed as quickly as usual. So, no, nothing significant on that front.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. No abdominal pain either. I’ve had no issues with my stomach at all, to be honest. I have a fairly robust constitution, usually. I haven't been ill with anything like that recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not as far as I'm aware. I've been relatively healthy, all things considered. Had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that’s about it. No chronic conditions, no ongoing treatment. Just the usual annual check-ups. I'm divorced, if that's relevant. I do have private insurance.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. That's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take a paracetamol for a headache, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing prescribed by a doctor. I prefer to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I like to keep things… natural, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, take any common medication without issue. I’ve never had a rash, breathing problems, or any sort of allergic response. It's another thing I've never had to worry about, thankfully. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I’m rather keen to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. That's very helpful. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, increased hunger, unintentional weight loss, frequent urination, and family history of diabetes – I would like to perform a physical exam and order some blood work to assess your blood glucose levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to proceed with whatever you deem necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and I’m eager to find out what's going on. Please, let's get on with it. The sooner I know, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please step onto the examination table, we'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs and perform a brief abdominal exam. I'll also check your reflexes and skin. It will be a fairly standard exam.
PATIENT: Certainly. Very well, Doctor. I shall remain as still as possible. Please, proceed at your leisure. I do have a meeting this afternoon, so the quicker we can go, the better, if you don't mind. No offense intended, of course.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Christen. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not a major concern at this point. Your pulse is 88, regular rhythm. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you could lie back, I'll palpate your abdomen. Is there any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No tenderness to report, Doctor. Nothing at all. My stomach is usually quite robust, as I said. I occasionally suffer from indigestion after a particularly spicy meal, but otherwise, it’s perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I trust you’ll find nothing untoward.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical, which is normal. Your skin appears healthy, with good turgor. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but given your symptoms, we need to investigate further with some blood work. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. The fasting blood glucose test requires you to not eat or drink anything for at least eight hours before the test. Do you have any difficulty with that?
PATIENT: No, that's perfectly manageable, Doctor. Eight hours is no problem at all. I often skip breakfast, so it won’t be an inconvenience. When and where shall I have this test done? Is there anything else I need to do to prepare? I'm rather efficient, so I'd like to get it over with as swiftly as possible, if you'll permit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will send the order electronically to the lab here in the clinic building. You can go anytime after 9 am tomorrow. The lab technician will explain the procedure when you arrive. Just ensure you haven't eaten or drank anything besides water for at least eight hours beforehand. Here is the requisition form. Take this with you to the lab. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you very much. 9 am tomorrow will do nicely. I appreciate your efficiency. It seems we’ve covered everything. If you don’t mind, I have a rather important meeting to prepare for. Do you require any further information from me at this time?
DOCTOR: No, Christen, I believe we've covered everything for now. I will contact you as soon as your results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly any confusion, dizziness, or severe dehydration – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a productive meeting.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and attention. I shall contact you if anything changes. I bid you good day. And again, thank you. .
