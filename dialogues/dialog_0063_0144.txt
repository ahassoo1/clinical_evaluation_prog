DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Waste time? Honestly, I don’t even remember why I scheduled this appointment. My grandson, David, he insisted. Said I should…get checked. Something about being my age. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just…curious, I suppose. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Perfectly fine” is rather vague, Ms. Calvery. At your age, and frankly, at any age, a little more specificity is appreciated. We need to establish a baseline. Now, can you recall anything that prompted David’s concern?
PATIENT: Oh, David always worries. He’s a good boy, but…a bit of a fussbudget, if you ask me. Let me think… He mentioned something about me forgetting things. Not important things, you understand. Just…names. And where I put my glasses. Which is ridiculous, they’re usually right on my head! Honestly, it’s probably just old age. Everyone forgets things when they get older, don't they?
DOCTOR: “Everyone” is another vague generalization, Ms. Calvery. While some cognitive slowing is typical with age, significant memory lapses warrant investigation. Now, aside from the glasses and names, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well…the television seems awfully loud these days. And sometimes…sometimes I have trouble following what people are saying. Not all the time, just…when they talk fast. And my grandson keeps saying I repeat myself. But I just want to make sure I get my point across, you know? It’s frustrating when people don’t listen the first time! It’s probably just everyone mumbling these days. They never speak clearly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, with all due respect, attributing everything to others’ shortcomings isn’t particularly helpful. Let’s try a brief review of your medical history, if you can recall. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Honestly, I haven’t had a proper check-up in…well, a very long time. My husband, bless his soul, always took care of all that. He said I worried too much about doctors. Something about poking and prodding. I think I had…the flu, once? And a bad cold last winter. Nothing serious, I assure you. I'm generally a very healthy woman. And I always take my vitamins!
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, now that you mention it… there was something. Years ago. After my husband passed, I think. Something with my…gallbladder? Or appendix? It was all a blur, honestly. So much happened then. And the doctor…he was a young man, very serious. Didn't explain things very well. I don't remember much beyond the waiting room. And the paperwork! Dreadful amounts of paperwork. It was all very stressful. Honestly, I try not to dwell on unpleasant things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It’s…relevant, Ms. Calvery. Now, family history. Were any of your parents or siblings afflicted with…anything significant?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to be quite old, almost ninety! She was a very strong woman. But…she was always a bit…eccentric. Collected porcelain dolls, hundreds of them. Filled the entire house. And my father…he was a businessman. Very successful. Died of…something with his heart, I think. A long time ago. My brother… He wasn’t very well. Always sickly as a child. But I can’t quite remember what he…had. It was a long time ago. And we weren't very close. Honestly, I'm terrible with remembering things like that. It's just…a jumble in my head. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon with my book club later.
DOCTOR: Very well. Perhaps a brief physical examination would be helpful. It will be…quick. If you would just follow me. We'll start with your vital signs, then a basic neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Neurological…what now? Is that where you poke and prod? Honestly, I really don't like being poked and prodded. And I’m not sure I have time for…assessments. My book club is very particular about punctuality. Are you sure this is necessary? I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Perhaps a simple blood test would be enough? Or just let me go home and rest? It’s a very hot day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, with all due respect, I am the physician here. A basic assessment is standard procedure, especially given your grandson’s concerns and your reported memory issues. It’s not about “poking and prodding,” it’s about gathering information. It will take only a few minutes. Now, if you would please, sit on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if it hurts, I’m leaving. And don’t expect me to remember anything you say afterwards, anyway. My brain isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, it’s just… exhausting, all this fuss. Just get it over with, dear. I have a prune danish waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not critically concerning at your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, with a mild murmur, likely benign. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear, I always did have a terrible startle reflex. My husband used to tease me mercilessly. Honestly, it’s just…a nervous habit. Ouch! That tickles! And it’s…rather undignified, don’t you think? All this tapping and poking. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Perhaps a glass of water would help?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished, but again, not unusual for your age. I’ll proceed with a brief cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and orientation. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s…date? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Is it…August? No, wait… July? It’s definitely a summer month. And…the second? Or maybe the third? Honestly, dates have never been my strong suit. My husband always remembered everything. I’m terribly sorry, dear. It’s just…a complete blur. Is it important? Can we skip this part? I'm much better at discussing literature, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed to the next question. Can you recall three objects I’m going to name?
PATIENT: Three objects? Oh, dear. Now you're testing me? Honestly, my brain feels rather…foggy today. Are they difficult objects? And how long do I have to remember them? This is terribly stressful, you know. Alright, go ahead. But don't expect miracles. I'm much better at remembering characters in novels than random objects.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Hmm… Apple… yes, I remember that. Fruit, red… Delicious! And… a table. For eating on, or… or putting things. And… Oh, dear. Something shiny? A coin? Or… a button? Honestly, it’s all a jumble. I think I’m forgetting things already. It was apple… and table… and… something small and round? I’m terribly sorry, dear. My brain just isn’t cooperating today. Is this going to affect my book club?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. That was… informative. Based on this brief examination and your reported symptoms, I suspect early-stage cognitive impairment. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it warrants further investigation. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive assessment.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. Cognitive impairment? Is that…dementia? I don't want a dementia! I still read, you know. And I’m perfectly capable of holding a conversation, most of the time. Are you sure it’s necessary? Perhaps it’s just stress? Or a vitamin deficiency? I take vitamins, you know! I eat a perfectly balanced diet, most of the time. I don't want to see a neurologist. I really don't. Can’t we just… monitor it? And perhaps give me something for my memory? A pill, or something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns, but dismissing this as “stress” or a “vitamin deficiency” without proper evaluation is irresponsible. Early detection is crucial. A neurologist can determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate management. I am not comfortable prescribing medication without a definitive diagnosis. Here is the neurologist’s contact information. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… I suppose… I suppose I have to. My grandson will be furious if I don’t. He worries so much. But… what if it is something serious? What if I… forget everything? What if I can’t even remember my book club? Will they… will they have to do tests? And… and what if the tests are bad? Honestly, this is just dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Is there… is there anything I can do in the meantime? A special diet? A brain exercise? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: There are some general recommendations. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle – balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep – is always beneficial. Staying mentally active is also important. Puzzles, reading, social interaction… things you already enjoy. This is a prescription for a multivitamin. It won't cure anything, but it can't hurt. Now, I believe we’ve covered everything. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: A multivitamin… It all seems so… hopeless. No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, dear. I suppose I should go. And schedule this… neurologist. Honestly, I’m not sure I can face it. It’s just… everything feels so blurry now.
