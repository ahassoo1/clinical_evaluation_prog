DOCTOR: Right. Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Batara. It’s just… well, my daughter, she says I need a card. A “get well” card, or… something encouraging. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. But she insists. Says it’ll… cheer me up. You know how daughters are. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: A card, yes. Well, that’s… unusual. Though I suppose daughters do worry. Still, we're here now, and I do need to understand why your daughter feels a visit is necessary. "Perfectly fine" can mean different things to different people. So, let's start with this: are you experiencing any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness. Well… my knees ache a bit more when it rains, if that counts. Always have, really. And I get tired easier. But everyone gets tired, don't they? I'm sixty! It’s not like I’m running marathons anymore. Honestly, Doctor, I think she's making a mountain out of a molehill. She worries if I don’t call her every single day. It's exhausting, frankly. Do you have to write something on a card?
DOCTOR: Knees aching with the rain… and fatigue. Right. Yes, those can be normal for someone your age, certainly. But we need to rule out anything more serious, don't we?
PATIENT: Rule out? What do you mean, “rule out”? Is there something wrong with me? I told you, I feel fine! My daughter just fusses too much. She reads those things online, you know? Always diagnosing everyone with… with things. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, I just want a card so she'll stop bothering me about it. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Micucci. I understand your daughter is concerned, and it’s good she’s looking out for you. And I'm not saying there is something wrong, but a quick check-up is always a good idea, especially with new symptoms. It's responsible care. Now, tell me more about this fatigue. When did it start?
PATIENT: “Responsible care”? Honestly. It started… oh, I don’t know. Maybe a few months ago? It’s hard to say. Things just sort of… creep up on you when you get older, don't they? I just sleep a little more. And I don’t have the energy to garden as much. Big deal. It’s not like I’m collapsing or anything. Honestly, I think she just wants an excuse to visit. She always brings cookies. They're too sweet. Do you have to ask so many questions?
DOCTOR: A few months, and less energy for gardening. Alright. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Fine. I eat. I don't stuff myself, but I eat. My husband cooks lovely dal bhat, you know. Though, I haven't been as hungry for sweets lately. But like I said, those cookies my daughter makes are far too sweet. Honestly, Doctor, are you actually listening to me, or just writing down a list of complaints I haven't even made? It’s rather… condescending.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just pull up your EHR information. I see here you haven’t had a check-up in… five years. That’s a bit long. And… hmm. It says here you’re uninsured. That makes things… complicated. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Uninsured? What’s that got to do with anything? I just want a card! And no, I haven’t lost weight. Maybe a pound or two, but that’s just normal fluctuations, isn’t it? Honestly, you're making a huge deal out of nothing. My daughter is going to be furious if you start charging her a fortune for this… this interrogation. It’s just a card, Doctor! A card. Do you think I’m wasting your time?
DOCTOR: “Wasting my time”?
PATIENT: Well… yes! A bit, perhaps. I feel perfectly healthy. My daughter is the one who’s… overreacting. Honestly, I don’t understand why I even came here. She insisted, you know? Said I needed “preventative care”. What does that even mean? I just want you to write something nice on a card so she'll stop nagging me. Is that really too much to ask? I've lived a long life, I know my body. It's just… aging. It happens.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, with all due respect, you came here for a medical consultation. And I am going to ask questions, because that is my job. Dismissing your symptoms as simply “aging” is not responsible care. Now, let's try this one more time. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really, Doctor? Now you're just being… intrusive! Honestly. I came here for a card, not a… a physical examination! My daughter will be absolutely mortified if you start asking about… that. This is ridiculous. I think I’m leaving. I feel perfectly fine, and I don’t appreciate being… interrogated. Just write something polite on a card and I'll be on my way. Something about “thinking of you” or… I don’t know. Anything. Just please, let me go home. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Micucci. I will write a note on a card. But I strongly advise you to reconsider scheduling a proper check-up. Dismissing potential health concerns is never a good idea. "Wishing you all the best, and hoping you continue to feel well." There. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
