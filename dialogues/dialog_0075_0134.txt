DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's... it's been my stomach, mostly. It just hasn't been right for a little while now. Feels sick a lot, and I don't even get very hungry, you know? I get full after just a tiny bit of food. It's… bothersome. I'm Raymonde, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Raymonde, it's good to meet you. “Not feeling right” can mean a lot of things. Let's try to narrow it down. You said your stomach hasn't been right “for a little while now.” Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… that’s hard. Seems like… maybe a couple of months? It comes and goes, really. Some days it's worse than others. I mostly just try to eat small meals when I can, but even then… it doesn’t always stay down. I wish I could remember exactly when it started, but things just aren’t as clear as they used to be. It's been a while since my husband passed, and… well, my memory hasn’t been the best since then, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Raymonde. Losing someone is incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for memory to be affected by grief and stress. Don’t worry about being precise; we'll work with what you do remember. You mentioned it comes and goes, and you get full quickly, even with small meals. Is there any particular food that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat. Soup, crackers, even just a little bit of toast… sometimes it's okay, sometimes it isn’t. I used to love fried chicken, but even that doesn’t sound good anymore. It’s just… unpredictable, I suppose. And the feeling sick… it's not always after I eat, either. Sometimes it’s just there when I wake up. It’s all a bit of a muddle, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable nausea and early satiety, regardless of food type. And it can happen even before you eat. Do you experience any heartburn or indigestion with this?
PATIENT: Heartburn… let me think. I do get a bit of a burning feeling sometimes, yes. Not all the time, but now that you mention it, it does happen. It’s usually after I lie down for a bit, I think. Not terribly bad, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Is that what you mean by indigestion? Because I do get a bit of bubbling in my tummy sometimes, too. It's a lot, isn't it? I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Raymonde. This is all very helpful. So, we have nausea, early satiety, occasional heartburn, a sour taste in your mouth, and some bubbling in your abdomen. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Changes in… well, you know. Yes, actually. I haven’t been… regular, let's say. Sometimes I have trouble going at all, and sometimes… well, it’s just not solid, if you understand what I mean. It's been going on for a little while, too, not just recently. I didn’t really think it was important, honestly. Just thought I was getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, thank you for sharing that. Changes in bowel habits are definitely important. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. And the doctor told me I had a bit of arthritis, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Mostly just my hands ache a bit in the cold. Oh, and I was told I had high blood pressure a while back, so I take a little pill for that every day. I think that’s it… I'm trying to remember everything. It’s been a long time. And I had pneumonia once, but that was ages ago, too. I hope I haven't forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, hypertension managed with medication, and a history of pneumonia. Thank you. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the pill for my blood pressure, I believe. Oh! And sometimes I take something for my hands when they’re really aching, but it’s just an over-the-counter pain reliever, nothing special. I can’t even remember the name of it right now. I used to take something for my water retention, but the doctor told me to stop taking that a while ago. Said it wasn't helping much. That’s about it, I think. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known drug allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to be a bit worried about bees, but that was when I was a little girl. I haven’t had any trouble with medications, as far as I can recall. I always tell the pharmacist everything I'm taking, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I've always been a bit of a worrier, but I know you're just trying to help. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is a little tender in the upper quadrants, but no masses are palpable. Your reflexes are normal. Based on what you've told me and this initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing gastritis, possibly with some associated constipation. However, given your age and the persistence of these symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes, such as anemia or thyroid issues. I also want to order a stool test to check for any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those tests… Is it something serious, Doctor? Gastritis… that sounds… unpleasant. And anemia and thyroid issues… I don’t even know what those are. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. And… are those tests expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. I don't want to cause too much trouble.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Raymonde. Gastritis simply means inflammation of the stomach lining. It can be caused by many things, and it's often treatable. The blood work and stool test are just to be thorough and rule out other possibilities. We need to have a complete picture to provide the best care. As for cost, Medicare typically covers these tests, although there may be a small co-pay depending on your plan. Our billing department can check the specifics for you and let you know the estimated cost upfront. I'll have them contact you after the visit. In the meantime, I recommend sticking to bland foods – things like toast, crackers, and soup – and avoiding anything spicy or acidic. Staying hydrated is also important. We’ll get the test results back in a few days, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a bit better, knowing Medicare will cover most of it. And bland foods… I can manage that. Soup is good. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. It’s just… everything feels a bit overwhelming sometimes. Getting old isn’t easy, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. And you’re right, getting older isn’t always easy. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’m here to help in any way I can. I’ll have the lab draw slips ready for you before you leave. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions. I just hope… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again for being so kind. I really do appreciate it. I suppose I should get those lab slips then, before I forget.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. Here are the lab slips. The front desk will schedule the appointment for you before you leave. Remember, we’re just being cautious. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
