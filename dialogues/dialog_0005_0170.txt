DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, uh, it’s for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? Medical stuff for the insurance. Hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: A life insurance physical, right. Okay. So, it’s not necessarily something you’re feeling, just something they require?
PATIENT: That's right. Nothing wrong with me, not that I know of. Just paperwork, I guess. They sent me here. Honestly, I don’t really understand all of it. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, we’ll do a standard physical, cover the basics. It’s good to have a baseline, even if you’re feeling perfectly fine. Helps them assess risk, and frankly, it’s good for you to know what’s going on. Now, have you had a primary care doctor before?
PATIENT: Uh, not really. Not for a long time, anyway. Used to see someone back on the islands, but that was… a while ago. Been okay mostly, just haven’t needed one. Is this gonna be a long list of questions? I got stuff to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’ll be a reasonable list, Mr. Putney. We need to cover some history – things you might not even think are important. Helps me get a picture of your overall health. We'll start with the basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I eat pretty much anything. We didn't have a lot of choices back home, you know? So, no allergies. Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… regular stuff. Water, you know? And coffee. Lots of coffee. Does that count as a medication?
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn't count, Mr. Putney. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hm... not that I know of. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, things like that. Nothing major. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. I used to work pretty hard, always on my feet, so I was pretty healthy back then. My back's been a little sore lately, but I figured it was just from work. Is that something I should have told you before?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s something you should have mentioned. Back pain is definitely relevant. How long has your back been sore?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, probably... a couple of months now? On and off, you know? Worse when I’m doing something physical. Lifting boxes, stuff like that. I thought it would just go away, but it hasn't really. It's not bad bad, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: And is the pain localized to your lower back, or does it radiate anywhere else – down your legs, for instance?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes it feels a little bit in my hip, on the left side. Not all the time, just when it’s really bad. Not like shooting pain or anything, just… a dull ache. Does that make sense? I'm not good at describing this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgery. Knock on wood. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I try to stay away from doctors as much as possible. Always figured I was wasting my time. That’s why I didn’t mention the back thing right away, honestly. Thought it would go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years back. Dad's still around, but he lives back on the islands. Haven’t seen him in a while. He’s… pretty old. Never really talked about health stuff, honestly. We weren’t close like that. Didn't know much about what he had or didn't have, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did your mother have any significant medical problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well... she was pretty sick towards the end. I think it was her heart. She got really tired, couldn't walk much. She was in the hospital for a while before... before she passed. That's about all I know, really. It happened fast. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, none of that. Never really got into any of that. Makes you feel bad, you know? I need to be able to work. Gotta stay sharp. I drink coffee, like I said, but that’s it. Doesn't count, right?
DOCTOR: No, coffee doesn't count. Finally, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just wanna get this over with, you know? Is it gonna be a long exam? I got a dentist appointment later.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I'll need to do a quick physical exam to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your back. It shouldn't take too long. If you could just sit here and relax, we'll get through it quickly. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it, okay? The sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, let's take a look at your back. Can you bend forward for me, and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is gonna hurt. This is… not good. Feels like something's pulled. See? Told you. This is why I don't go to doctors.
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s some tenderness upon palpation, particularly on the left side. Range of motion is limited, as you’ve demonstrated. And do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Nope, no numbness or tingling. Just… pain. A lot of pain when I move wrong. Feels like a muscle strain, honestly. Probably just slept wrong or something. This happens sometimes when I’m doing hard work. It usually goes away after a few days. Oof. Maybe not this time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it appears you likely have a muscle strain in your lower back. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and given your mother’s cardiac history, I want to be thorough. I'm going to order some blood work - a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – to rule out any underlying issues and get a better picture of your overall health. I also want to get an X-ray of your lower back to check for any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Really? I just wanted a quick checkup for the insurance. This is getting complicated. How long is all this gonna take? And how much is it gonna cost? I got bills to pay, you know? Is the insurance gonna cover all of this?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Putney. However, it’s important to be thorough, even for a routine checkup. The blood work and X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your health and ensure we're not missing anything. As for cost, I’m unsure of your exact coverage, but the front desk can verify what your insurance will cover. They can also discuss payment options if necessary. I recommend you schedule these tests as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan to manage your back pain and address your blood pressure if needed. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Blood work, X-ray… whatever. I just wanna get this over with. What do I need to do? Where do I go? And how long will the results take? I got a life to live, you know? And can I just get a note or something saying I came in? For the insurance?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a note stating you came in for a medical evaluation today. As for the tests, you can go to the imaging center and lab across the street - their address is on the referral. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once they're available, the lab and imaging center will send them directly to my office. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and use ice packs on your lower back to help manage the pain. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Nope. That's all, I think. Just wanna go home and relax now. Thanks… I guess. Hopefully, the tests don't show anything serious. .
