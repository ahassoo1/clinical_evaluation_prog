DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. And try to be concise; my schedule is rather full.
PATIENT: Concise, huh? Well, it's this… shaking. In my hands. Been happening for a bit now. Don't remember exactly when it started, honestly. Old age, probably. What do you expect? Don't make a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. While aging can contribute to certain tremors, we don't simply dismiss things as inevitable. How would you describe the shaking, precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Ugh. Look, it… jiggles. When I try to do things. Like, hold a fork, or… you know. It's not constant, thankfully. Mostly when I'm trying to do something. Not when I’m just sitting around, thankfully. It's just… annoying. Makes me look like a fool. Is that specific enough for you? Honestly, I haven't paid much attention. Never been one for details.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” and “making you look like a fool” are not precisely medical descriptions, Mr. Baide. Is it worse on one hand than the other?
PATIENT: Worse…? Hmm. I suppose… the left one. Yes, definitely the left. Though, to be frank, they both shake. It's just… more noticeable on the left. And it happens when I’m stressed, maybe? Or when I’ve had too much coffee. Though, I don’t drink that much coffee anymore. My wife… she didn’t like it. Not that that’s relevant now. She's gone. So, left hand, I guess. Now, can we get on with this? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get tired, of course. I'm eighty years old! What do you expect? My bones ache sometimes, and my memory isn’t what it used to be… though I doubt that’s what you’re asking about. No, I don’t think so. Nothing else. Just the shaking. And the tiredness. Is that good enough? Honestly, I’m starting to forget why I even came here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, please try to focus. Have you experienced any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Look, I don't go tumbling around every five minutes if that’s what you mean. Maybe I’m a little… unsteady on my feet sometimes. But who isn’t at my age? It's just… part of getting old. I haven’t fallen or anything drastic. Just a little wobble here and there. Are we done yet? I’ve got a lunch appointment. With… uh… friends. Yes, friends.
DOCTOR: And what about stiffness, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Stiffness…? Oh, yes. Now that you mention it, my fingers are a bit stiff in the morning. And my back, sometimes. But I put it down to sleeping in a bad position. Or the weather. It's always the weather, isn't it? Everyone complains about the weather. Honestly, I don’t see what it has to do with my hands shaking. Can we just… figure out what’s wrong and get it over with? I really don’t have time for a long interrogation. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, Mr. Baide. Please extend your arms. And try to relax. I will assess your tremor and check your muscle tone and reflexes.
