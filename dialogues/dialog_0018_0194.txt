DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, it’s… my ears, I think. They’ve been acting up. And… dizziness. It comes and goes, you see. It's hard to explain properly. It’s been happening a while now, but it feels… worse lately, maybe? My daughter thought I should come. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain; we'll work through it together. So, you've been experiencing issues with your ears and some dizziness. Could you tell me a bit more about the ear issues?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. It's more like… everything gets muffled. Like someone turned the volume down really low. And sometimes… and this is the strange part… it just goes. Like the sound just… disappears. Then it comes back, maybe hours later, maybe the next day. It’s very unsettling. And then the spinning… Oh, it feels like the room is moving, even when I'm sitting still. It doesn’t last long, usually, but it’s frightening. My husband… he used to get something similar, actually. Though, that was years ago.
DOCTOR: I see. So, muffled hearing that comes and goes, sometimes with a complete loss of sound, and episodes of dizziness that feel like the room is spinning. It’s helpful you mention your husband experienced something similar. To help me understand a little better, can you tell me when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start…? That's a tricky one. It feels like… a long time ago, now. Probably… maybe six months? Or maybe longer. It started gradually, I think. Just little things at first. Not noticing things clearly, you know? Thinking people were mumbling. I just thought I was getting old! It's been the last three months, though, that it's really bothered me. And the spinning started around then too, I think. It’s hard to keep track, Doctor. Everything just blurs together.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for symptoms to develop gradually, and it can be hard to pinpoint the exact start date. Six months ago, with worsening over the past three months – that gives me a good starting point. Now, when these episodes of dizziness occur, do they happen with any particular movements?
PATIENT: Hmm... movements? Let me think. No, not always. Sometimes it just happens when I’m sitting, reading. Or watching television. But… now that you mention it… I think it’s worse when I turn my head quickly. Or if I try to get up too fast. Just a little bit. It's not every time, but… yes, I think you're right. When I move quickly, it’s more likely to happen. It’s a bit scary, you know, afraid I’ll fall.
DOCTOR: That’s very important information, Ms. Mayhugh. The fact that the dizziness is linked to head movements is significant. It helps us narrow down the possibilities. To get a more complete picture, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Oh dear. Let me think… I haven't really noticed anything else, to be honest. Maybe… a little bit of tiredness, but I put that down to getting older. And I've been a bit forgetful lately, but that’s just… well, that’s just me. I wouldn't say it's worse than usual, anyway. I don’t know if that’s helpful. I do get a bit anxious when the dizziness happens, so maybe I feel a bit shaky then. But it doesn’t last long. It’s just… the ear stuff is the main thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It’s helpful to know what isn’t happening as well as what is. A little tiredness, some forgetfulness, and anxiety during the dizzy spells – I appreciate you sharing all of this. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, medical history… That's a long story, Doctor. Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bike. Nothing major, really. I've had the usual… colds, flu, things like that. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, and I take medication for it. And… oh yes, I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That was a difficult time. I don't remember much else, to be honest. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Tonsils out as a child, a broken wrist, high blood pressure treated with medication, and a hysterectomy – I've got that all recorded. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the one, I think. A small white pill, every morning. I get it from the pharmacy, automatically. My daughter helps me keep track, mostly. She worries about me forgetting. I don’t really pay much attention to the names of the pills, if I’m honest. It’s just… the white one. I haven’t started anything new recently, though. No, definitely not.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It’s good to know you haven’t started any new medications recently. And it’s excellent that your daughter helps you keep track – that’s very supportive. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies? No, not that I know of. I've never really had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, mostly. My daughter always asks me before I try new things, just in case. But I’ve never had a problem. I don't have any trouble with pollen or dust, or anything like that. No, I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies – that’s good to know. Now, Ms. Mayhugh, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, towards the end of his life. And… oh yes, my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her ears. Not the same as me, I don’t think. She was very deaf, towards the end. She couldn’t hear a thing. And… my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. That’s all I can really remember, to be honest. It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, hearing loss in your aunt, and high blood pressure in your brother – I’ve got that all recorded. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle...? Oh, goodness. Well, I'm retired now, so I don't work. I mostly stay at home. I enjoy watching television, and reading. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back isn't very good these days. I don't really go out much, except to go to the shops or to the doctor. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I do like a bit of chocolate. And I worry a lot, if that counts. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhugh. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to examine your ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, that sounds… fine. I don’t really like doctors, but I understand you need to. Just… be gentle, please? And explain what you’re doing, if you don’t mind. I get a bit nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything I’m doing as I go along. It’s perfectly alright to be nervous; many people feel that way. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This helps me check for any unusual sounds. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. I’m going to use an otoscope, which is a lighted instrument, to look inside your ear canals. It won’t hurt, but you might feel a slight pressure. I'll gently pull on your earlobe to straighten the ear canal. Hmm… I see some wax buildup in both ear canals, but nothing significant. Your eardrums appear intact, but they are a little… dull. And there's some slight redness behind the eardrums. Now, I'd like to check your balance. I'm going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for as long as you can. I'll be right here to steady you if you need it. A little unsteady, Ms. Mayhugh, but you are maintaining your balance. Now, I'd like you to walk a few steps forward and then back. A slight wobble, but your gait is generally stable. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That wasn’t as bad as I thought, actually. It was a bit strange, having someone look in my ears, but… you were very gentle. So… what does it all mean, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? I do worry, you know. This dizziness is very unsettling. And I don't want to end up falling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s perfectly natural to worry, especially when experiencing dizziness. Based on the information you’ve provided and the results of the physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. Essentially, this happens when tiny crystals in your inner ear become dislodged and move into the wrong part of your ear. This disrupts your sense of balance, especially when you change head positions, which explains why you feel dizzy when you move quickly or turn your head. The wax buildup could be contributing to the muffled hearing, and the redness behind the eardrums might indicate a mild inflammation. It's not usually serious, Ms. Mayhugh, but it can be very unpleasant. It’s also very treatable. To confirm the diagnosis, I would like to perform a specific maneuver called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. It involves moving your head in a certain way to see if it triggers the dizziness. It might feel a little strange, but it doesn’t cause any harm. Would you be comfortable with me performing that maneuver now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Crystals in my ear? That sounds… peculiar. And a maneuver? It sounds a bit scary, to be honest. Will it make me more dizzy, Doctor? I don't really like the idea of feeling even worse. But… if it will help you figure out what’s wrong, I suppose I can try it. Just… please be gentle, and tell me what you're doing every step of the way. And if I feel too uncomfortable, can I stop?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. I completely understand your apprehension. It does sound peculiar, I agree. And yes, there is a chance it could briefly make you feel more dizzy, but it's usually very short-lived – a matter of seconds. We will stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. I will explain every step of the process before I do it, and I will be right here to support you. Here's what we'll do. You’ll be sitting on the examination table. I'm going to ask you to lie back quickly, with your head turned to the right side, about 45 degrees. I will then quickly move your head to the left side. We’ll repeat this a couple of times on each side. I will be watching your eyes carefully for a specific type of eye movement called nystagmus. This movement helps me identify whether the crystals are dislodged. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… a bit complicated. Lying back quickly? And turning my head? I'm not very good at quick movements, you know. And what if I fall? I get very nervous when I have to lie down. But… if it's the only way to find out what’s wrong… alright. Just… please be very careful. And if I start to panic, can I stop immediately? And hold my hand, please? I think that would help.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll take it very slowly, and I will be right here supporting you every step of the way. We can stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable, and I will gladly hold your hand. Your comfort and safety are my priority. Here, let me help you lie back slowly. I’ll support your head and neck. We’ll take it very easy. Now, I’m going to ask you to turn your head to the right, about 45 degrees. Just breathe normally. Okay, now I'm going to quickly move your head to the left. How do you feel?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That was… strange. Everything started to spin, just for a moment. And my eyes… they were flickering, I think. It felt very uncomfortable. And… and a bit frightening, to be honest. Is that… is that what you were looking for? It felt awful. Please don’t do that again. Can we stop now? I’m feeling very dizzy and a bit sick. And my heart is racing. Please, Doctor. I think I need to sit up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We will stop immediately. I apologize if that was unpleasant – I understand it was frightening. It's perfectly alright to feel dizzy and sick afterward. It means the maneuver was likely positive, indicating BPPV. Here, please take a few sips of water. And here's a tissue if you need it. Just take deep breaths and try to relax. Your pulse is a little elevated, which is understandable given the situation. It will likely return to normal shortly. Based on your symptoms and the positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver, I am confident in diagnosing you with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. There is a specific treatment called the Epley Maneuver that can reposition the crystals in your inner ear and relieve your symptoms. It involves a series of head movements, similar to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, but performed in a specific sequence. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Another maneuver? I'm not sure I can face another one, Doctor. My head is still spinning, and I feel very weak. Is there anything else I can do? Medication, perhaps? Or… or just wait and see if it gets better on its own? I'm really not good with these things. And I don't want to end up falling again. Please, Doctor. I think I need to rest. And maybe a cup of tea?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Mayhugh. You've been through a lot, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We can absolutely discuss alternative options. Medication can help manage the symptoms – anti-nausea medication to reduce any sickness, and anti-vertigo medication to reduce the spinning sensation. However, medication doesn’t address the underlying cause of the BPPV, and the symptoms often return when you stop taking it. Waiting and seeing if it gets better on its own is also an option, but it can take weeks or months for the symptoms to resolve, and there's a risk of falls in the meantime. The Epley Maneuver is the most effective treatment for BPPV, but we can certainly postpone it if you’re not comfortable with it at this time. For now, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. I will prescribe you an anti-nausea medication and an anti-vertigo medication. I also recommend avoiding sudden head movements and lying flat as much as possible. And yes, a cup of tea sounds lovely. Let me see if one of the nurses can bring you one. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms don’t improve, we can discuss repeating the Epley Maneuver at that time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… alright, Doctor. Medication and rest sounds much better than another maneuver right now. And a cup of tea would be lovely, thank you. A follow-up appointment in a week sounds good too. It gives me time to recover, and think about things. I don't want to rush into anything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. And… and thank you for holding my hand. That made a big difference.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s my pleasure. Your comfort and well-being are my top priority, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I will have the nurse bring you the prescriptions and a cup of tea right away. In the meantime, please just rest and try to relax. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I just need to rest now. And… maybe a biscuit with my tea? If that’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Mayhugh. A biscuit with your tea sounds perfect. I'll make sure the nurse brings one along. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and I’ll see you next week.
