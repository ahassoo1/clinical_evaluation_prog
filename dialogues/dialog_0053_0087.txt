DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Croonquist, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doc. Just… lab work, I think. The lady on the phone said something about it. Medicare wants me to get some things checked. Honestly, I don't really remember what things. Been a bit foggy lately, you know?
DOCTOR: Foggy, yes. Well, that doesn't make things easy, does it?
PATIENT: No, it really doesn’t. Look, can we just… do the tests? I’ve got things to do, and honestly, the less I have to talk about it, the better. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can certainly start with some tests. But you understand that knowing why Medicare wants these tests done is rather important, don’t you?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate that, Doc, I really do. But the lady on the phone… she just rattled off a list of numbers and said "lab work." I asked her twice what it was for and she just repeated the numbers. Honestly, it’s probably just… routine stuff, right? For my age? I turned seventy-three a few months back, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Seventy-three… Let’s see here. Clicks a few buttons. Ah, yes. Routine annual check-up ordered by Medicare, with a focus on kidney function and a complete blood count. They likely want to rule out any age-related decline or early signs of anemia, given your age. It is standard procedure, you're right. But I still need a bit of your history, Mr. Croonquist, just to have a complete picture. Do you have any known medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… Hmm. Well, I used to have… something with my back. Years ago. Working at the power plant, you know? Heavy lifting. But that’s… gone now. I think. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that’s ages ago. Other than that… nothin’ much. Really.
DOCTOR: Right. Back problems, resolved. Appendectomy. Anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had a… a little bit of trouble with my heart, maybe ten years back? The doctor put me on some pills for a while. But I stopped taking them. Felt better without ‘em. Don't remember the name of the pills, though. And, uh... I think I had the flu a couple of times. Does that count?
DOCTOR: You stopped taking heart medication?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. Doc said I could, eventually. I think. It was… a long time ago. I felt fine without ‘em, so… I just stopped. Look, I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age, okay? I just want to get this lab work done and go home. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, stopping prescribed medication can be… unwise. Regardless, we need to establish what medication you were taking, and for how long. Do you recall anything about it?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't remember, Doc! It was… little white pills, I think. Maybe a small blue one too. They made me feel a bit tired, so when the doctor said I could stop, I did! Honestly, it was ages ago. Power plant work keeps a fella busy, you don’t spend much time thinking about pills when you’re dealing with turbines and generators.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to dig a bit deeper. It’s crucial to know your cardiac history, even if you don't recall the specifics. Let’s start with a basic physical exam, then we'll get the lab work done. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… fine. Just get it over with, okay? And then I can go?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but not particularly pronounced. Pulse is regular, but a bit weak. Okay, Mr. Croonquist. I'm going to need a urine sample now, and then we can get the blood work started. There's a restroom down the hall. Do you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: No, no. I can find the restroom. Just tell me where to take the sample when I’m done. And then the blood work? Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Take the sample in the restroom, and then place it in the small plastic container and pass it through that window. The lab technician will come get it. Then come back, and we'll do the blood work. Don’t drink too much fluid before, or it will be a bit difficult. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Window. Not too much drink. Got it. Let’s get this done.
DOCTOR: Patient somewhat uncooperative and provides limited history. Vague recollection of cardiac medication. Elevated blood pressure, slight heart murmur. Proceeding with lab work as ordered. Will need to emphasize the importance of follow-up and cardiac monitoring. .
