DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well... it's a bit silly, really. I just... I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or… something encouraging. My niece, she says I need to ask the doctor for one. For… you know… morale. It’s important, you understand.
DOCTOR: A…card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like, with a nice message. It’s just… things haven’t been easy, you know? A little encouragement from a professional… it would mean a lot. My niece, she’s very particular about these things. Says it has to be official if it’s going to do any good. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. My role is to diagnose and treat medical conditions, not to provide… motivational correspondence. While I appreciate your niece’s…enthusiasm for your well-being, this is not a standard practice. Perhaps a visit with a therapist would be more appropriate for addressing morale?
PATIENT: A therapist? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I don’t need a therapist. I just want a little card! You’re a doctor, aren’t you? You’re supposed to make people feel better. A kind word… it’s medicine too, you know. It’s good for the spirit. I’m not asking for a miracle, just a simple card. Are you saying you can’t write me a card? Is that what you're telling me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I can assure you, I am perfectly capable of writing. However, I find your request… perplexing. It’s not within the scope of medical care. Before we continue this discussion, let’s focus on your actual health concerns. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Well… I get tired, easily. And my knees ache. But that’s just… old age, Doctor. Everyone my age aches. I don’t see what that has to do with a card. My niece says it needs to be documented… like, if I get a card from the doctor saying I need encouragement, then it’s… official. It’s a whole thing. You wouldn’t understand. Are you absolutely refusing to write me a card?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, your niece's logic is… unsound. However, since you insist on a documented assessment, let’s proceed with a basic examination to address your reported fatigue and knee pain. We will document those findings. That is a medical service I can provide. Then, we can discuss appropriate, evidence-based interventions. But a “Get Well” card is simply not within my purview. Now, can you describe the pain in your knees?
PATIENT: Fine. Examine my knees, then. But don’t think for a minute I’m giving up on the card. It’s the principle of the thing, you know? My niece… she's very persuasive. The pain… it’s mostly when I walk. And sometimes when I sit for too long. It’s a dull ache. Not sharp. Just… there. Like an old memory, you understand? Is that enough documentation for you?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit on the examination table. I'll need you to extend your legs one at a time. Let's start with the right knee. Now, tell me, is there pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Right there. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It’s been getting worse lately, I suppose. And sometimes it feels… stiff. Like it needs oiling, you know? Like an old machine. Is that what you’re looking for? Documentation of… stiffness?
DOCTOR: I am documenting tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee joint. Range of motion appears slightly limited. Now, can you fully extend and flex your leg?
PATIENT: It… cracks a little. And it doesn’t go all the way straight, or all the way bent. Not like it used to. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do anything. Now… Well, it’s not what it used to be, that’s for sure. Still no card?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion noted, with crepitus upon flexion and extension. Now, let’s examine your left knee. Extend your leg, please. I am documenting similar tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of the left knee. It seems we are dealing with bilateral knee pain. It is likely osteoarthritis, but we will need imaging to confirm. We’ll start with X-rays. Now, tell me about the fatigue. When did it start?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Sounds serious. X-rays, you say? That doesn’t sound cheap. The fatigue… hmm. It started… maybe six months ago? Just… tired all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep. My niece says it’s probably stress. She says I need to relax more. But how can I relax when I’m tired and my knees hurt? And still no card. Is a card too much to ask for someone with… osteoarthritis?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, common with age. It’s not an emergency. As for your fatigue, it could be related to the osteoarthritis, or it could be a number of other things. We need to rule those out. I’m ordering blood work to assess for anemia, thyroid issues, and other potential causes. Now, let’s proceed with the blood draw and X-rays. I will review the results, and we can discuss a treatment plan. And to reiterate, a motivational card is not a standard medical intervention. We are addressing your physical health concerns. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, X-rays… it’s always something. No, I don’t have any allergies… as far as I know. My niece would have told me if I did. She knows everything. But you're still not writing the card? Not even a little "Get Well Soon"? It would just be nice. A little encouragement… it can’t hurt, can it? It's just paper and ink.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am ordering appropriate diagnostic tests to address your health concerns. That is my professional obligation. I will not be writing a “Get Well” card. We’ll discuss the results of your blood work and X-rays, and formulate a treatment plan. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. Just… trying to get through the day. You know… living. It’s hard when everything hurts and you’re tired all the time. And you have a doctor who won't write a simple card. I guess I'll go get the blood work done. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will escort you to the lab. We will contact you with the results. Patient presents with fatigue and bilateral knee pain. Demands a motivational card, despite lacking any acute medical condition. Will proceed with standard diagnostic workup. .
