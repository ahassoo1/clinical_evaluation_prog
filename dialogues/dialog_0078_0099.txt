DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, and they weren’t quite right, so my regular doctor suggested I come see you. It was an… GI Endo Test, I believe she called it. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, a GI Endoscopy. That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you followed up. So, your regular doctor recommended you see me to discuss the results of that test. Do you have a copy of those results with you today, Denis?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I made sure to bring everything she suggested. I always try to be prepared. Though, honestly, I don’t understand much of what’s written on them. It’s a lot of… very long words.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. That’s very thoughtful of you. It is quite a bit of medical terminology, it’s perfectly normal to not understand it all. Let me take a few minutes to go over these findings… Okay, it looks like the endoscopy showed some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. There are also a few small polyps noted in the stomach. Have you been experiencing any symptoms, Denis?
PATIENT: Inflammation… and polyps. Symptoms… well, yes, actually. For the past few months, I’ve had a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes. It feels like… food gets stuck. And I’ve been getting heartburn quite a lot, especially after I eat. It’s not constant, but it’s bothersome. And sometimes, my stomach just feels… unsettled. A bit of cramping, you know? Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, that’s exactly what I mean. Difficulty swallowing, heartburn, and stomach cramping are all consistent with what we’re seeing here. How often would you say you experience the difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say exactly. Not every day, certainly. Perhaps… two or three times a week? It doesn’t happen with everything I eat. Soft foods are usually fine. It’s more with things like… meat, or bread with a crust. Anything a bit tougher, really. And it's not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like something is blocking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the heartburn is more frequent after eating. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s a burning sensation, right here… …in my chest, and it sometimes travels up into my throat. It’s not excruciating, but it's very unpleasant. Like something is… agitated. And sometimes it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I usually try to lie down after I eat, which helps a little, but it doesn't always go away completely. I find that drinking water offers some relief, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a burning sensation in your chest, sometimes traveling up to your throat, a sour taste, and some relief with lying down and drinking water. That all aligns with what’s commonly experienced with acid reflux. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that was just age, I think. I used to be very active, but… well, getting older takes its toll. I had a surgery on my left knee about five years ago. Aside from that… no major illnesses, no heart problems, no diabetes. My wife… my late wife, she had high blood pressure, but I never inherited that. I always ate well, tried to stay active. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, that’s exactly the sort of thing I’m looking for. Thank you for sharing that with me. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. And it’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy, and that the knee surgery was your only major medical intervention. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I can recall. And no food allergies either. I eat a bit of everything, really. My wife used to joke that I had a cast iron stomach. Nothing has ever bothered me. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I'm quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I always believed in letting the body heal itself, as much as possible. I used to make herbal remedies with my grandmother when I was a boy, but… that was a long time ago. Nowadays, I just try to eat a balanced diet and get enough rest. I did take some pain medication after my knee surgery, of course, but I stopped taking that as soon as I could. It was just… ibuprofen, I think. Nothing long-term.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, before we proceed with discussing potential causes and treatment options, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright, Denis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper physical in… well, a long time. I suppose it’s a good idea. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I am an old man, but I can still tell you if something doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. I appreciate that. I will certainly let you know. Alright, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I do note some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, specifically around your stomach. It’s not severe, but it’s present. It aligns with what you’ve been describing with your discomfort. Everything else feels normal.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s where it feels most uncomfortable. Right there. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It comes and goes, really. It's worse after I eat, like you said. I suppose that’s not surprising. I am glad you noticed it, though. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just being an old worrywart. But it's good to know it’s something real.
DOCTOR: It’s good you pointed that out, Denis. It’s certainly not just in your head. Based on your symptoms, the endoscopy results showing inflammation and polyps, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen, it's most likely that you have gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining, and possibly some esophageal irritation contributing to the difficulty swallowing. The polyps need further investigation to rule out anything concerning. Now, gastritis can have several causes, including H. pylori infection, frequent use of certain medications, and sometimes, autoimmune conditions. To determine the exact cause, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Gastritis… and polyps. It sounds… serious. H. pylori… I’ve never heard of that before. And tests… yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I want to know what’s going on. I’ve always believed in facing things head-on. So, yes, please. Order whatever tests you need. I just want to feel better. And to know what caused this. Is it… is it something I did? Did I eat something wrong? Is it serious? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I am just… anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Denis. And you’re not at all bothering me with your questions. It's my job to address your concerns. Gastritis itself isn't typically life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to complications. The polyps are the main reason we need to investigate further, to rule out any potential for them to become cancerous, although that's not likely. The H. pylori infection is a common cause of gastritis, and it's easily treatable with antibiotics. It's not something you did, it's usually contracted through contaminated food or water. We’ll also check for other causes, like autoimmune conditions. I'd like to order a stool test to check for H. pylori, a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out other conditions, and a follow-up endoscopy to get a better look at the polyps and take a biopsy if necessary. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. A stool test, a blood test, and another endoscopy. It seems like a lot, but… I understand. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. If that's what you recommend, Doctor, then that's what I want. And the biopsy… yes, if that's necessary, then please do it. I just want to know what I’m dealing with. Can you explain how these tests will be done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a trip planned next month, and I'm hoping I'll be able to go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let me explain the tests. The stool test is very straightforward – you’ll receive a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a sample at home and bring it to the lab. The blood test will be done here in the clinic, just a simple blood draw. As for the follow-up endoscopy, it will be similar to the first one, but we'll take a small tissue sample from the polyps for analysis. It's generally well-tolerated. As for the results, the stool test usually takes about 3-5 business days. The blood test results typically come back within a week. The biopsy results will take a bit longer, usually about 1-2 weeks, as they need to be analyzed by a pathologist. I understand you have a trip planned next month. We'll try to expedite the results as much as possible, and I'll make a note of your travel plans in your chart. If the results come back before your trip, we can discuss them and make a plan for managing your condition while you’re away. If the results aren’t back yet, we can discuss options for delaying your trip if necessary, or managing your condition while you’re traveling, depending on what the initial findings are. Does that sound acceptable, Denis?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A bit of a wait, but I suppose that’s to be expected. I appreciate you taking my trip into consideration, Doctor. It's important to me. And I trust your judgment, whatever you think is best. So, yes. Let's proceed with the tests. When can I get the collection kit for the stool test? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood test? I always worry about getting enough fluids beforehand, you know. Old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll have the nurse prepare a stool collection kit for you right away. She'll also give you detailed instructions on how to collect the sample properly. As for the blood test, you don’t need to do anything special. Just try to be well-hydrated beforehand, and avoid eating anything after midnight the night before. You can have water, but no solid food. It’s a good habit to stay hydrated, regardless! I'll also order the blood test now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Denis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with all my questions. It's reassuring to know that we have a plan. I suppose all that’s left is to wait for the results. I'll try to stay hydrated, as you suggested. And I’ll let the nurse know when I’m ready for the blood test. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what’s going on. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. Have a good day, Denis.
