DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...Farson, yes. Listen, it's this bruising. It's getting ridiculous. I'm on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump, a scrape, fine. But lately? I look like I've been in a fight. It's quite embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re noticing increased bruising, even with minor injuries, and you’re concerned about it, especially given you’re taking a blood thinner. That is concerning, and good you're bringing it to my attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. It's been…gradual. Maybe a month or so ago? I hit my arm on the doorframe – nothing, usually just a little red mark. This time, it was a plum color and stayed for nearly a week. Then, I stubbed my toe – same thing. It's just…more. And bigger. I don’t recall ever bruising this easily before the medication, of course. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over about a month, and more significant bruising than usual, even with minor trauma. You hadn’t experienced this level of bruising before starting the blood thinner, which is helpful to know. And just to be thorough, are the bruises appearing spontaneously at all – meaning, without any injury you can recall?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not spontaneously. I haven’t woken up covered in them, if that's what you mean. It's always something – a little bump against furniture, a slightly harder grip when I'm gardening… normal things. But the extent of the bruising is the problem. It's… disproportionate. I'm not a clumsy man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, bruising related to minor trauma, but significantly more than you’d expect. That definitely warrants investigation. Let’s go through a bit more of your history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what might require a blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, there was the… the heart thing, years ago. A-fib, they called it. That’s why I’m on the medication, naturally. And my wife... well, she had diabetes, Type 2. I try to be careful with my sugar, but… honestly, it's been hard since she passed. I don’t always eat as well as I should. Besides that… no. I was always a healthy man, up until… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of atrial fibrillation, which is why you're on a blood thinner, and a family history of Type 2 diabetes. It’s understandable that your eating habits have changed since your wife passed; that's a big adjustment. Now, have you had any other medical procedures or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… years ago, I had my appendix out, routine as could be. And… oh, a few years back, I had a scope, just to check things. Doctor Ramirez did it. Nothing remarkable found, if I recall. That’s about it, I think. No major surgeries. Certainly nothing recently. I'm not one for hospitals, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy years ago and a scope with no significant findings. That’s good to know. And just to be complete, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. The blood thinner, Warfarin, I believe it’s called. And… a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, maybe? Something like that. Small dose. And… a multivitamin. That’s it. I'm not a fan of taking pills, honestly. I prefer a good, healthy diet. When I can manage it, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for the A-fib, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife, she was terribly allergic to shellfish, but I always enjoyed it. I’ve never had an issue. No, no allergies, Doctor. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Farson, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’d like to take a look at the bruising you’ve been experiencing, and just generally examine you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Get it over with. It’s just… unsettling, having this happen. I've always been a strong man, and this feels...weak. Do what you need to do. I'd like to get to the bottom of this, if possible. And perhaps adjust the dosage of that Warfarin, if that’s what’s causing it. It's just... concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Farson, and we will get to the bottom of this. It’s important to investigate these things, and it’s good you brought it to my attention. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that could be due to anxiety about the bruising. Your pulse is normal. Okay, I see the bruising on both arms. It does appear more significant than I’d expect with minor trauma. The color is consistent with recent bruising. I don't feel any significant swelling or tenderness. Do you know about any other areas of bruising?
PATIENT: Just my legs, a little. Not as bad as the arms, though. I bumped them against the coffee table a few days ago, but… this is just getting ridiculous. I have to be careful when I walk. It feels like I’m walking on eggshells. Honestly, Doctor, I'm afraid I'm going to fall and break something. And then what? More medication? More problems? It's just...a vicious cycle, isn't it? I'm not getting any younger, that's for certain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It’s very reasonable to be worried about falls, especially with increased bruising. We want to prevent that. I'm going to check your legs now. Okay, similar bruising on both legs. Your range of motion is good, and your reflexes are normal. I'm not detecting any other concerning signs at this point. Given your history and the exam findings, I want to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your INR, which measures how well your Warfarin is working, as well as a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes of bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests sound… sensible. I just want to know why this is happening. The INR, you say? That will tell you if the medication is the problem? Hopefully, it’s just a dosage adjustment needed. I do not want to stop taking the Warfarin. That’s what the cardiologist said to do, and I don't want to risk a stroke. Do what you need to do, Doctor. And tell me… what am I looking at, timeline-wise? How long until we have results? I have a gardening club meeting on Thursday… I hope this won’t interfere.
DOCTOR: Yes, the INR will tell us how well your Warfarin is working, and whether your dosage needs adjusting. It’s good that you’re proactive about continuing it as directed by your cardiologist – that’s very important. We should have the blood test results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. That should be well before your gardening club meeting on Thursday. In the meantime, I recommend being extra cautious to avoid any further injuries. And, to be on the safe side, I’m going to give you a referral to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – just to rule out anything more serious. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something serious, but it’s best to have a thorough evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A hematologist… yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. It just seems… excessive. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I don't want to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. But if that's what you recommend… then alright. A referral is fine. Just… please, try to keep it simple. I'm not a fan of long hospital stays or complicated procedures. I just want to be able to garden again without worrying about turning into a blueberry. And perhaps adjust the dosage of this Warfarin. That’s my main concern, Doctor. The bruising is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Farson. We'll keep everything as simple as possible. The hematologist will likely start with a more detailed history and physical, and then may order some additional blood tests. It doesn’t necessarily mean any complicated procedures. I've already entered the referral for the hematologist, and my nurse will provide you with their contact information and help schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to order those initial blood tests for you today, and we’ll review the results as soon as they come back. We'll then discuss whether a dosage adjustment of your Warfarin is needed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers it. Just… get the blood tests done, and hopefully, it's just a simple adjustment. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It's… reassuring to talk to someone who understands. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle with the blood draw. My veins aren't what they used to be. Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you when the results are in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I'll make a note to tell my nurse to be gentle with the blood draw. It was my pleasure, and I'm glad I could reassure you. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are in. Have a good day, and please be careful.
