DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, you know? I'm trying to get it checked out before it gets worse. I don't have time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. Annoying symptoms are certainly worth investigating, and it’s wise to address them proactively. Could you describe the tingling in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles? Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t go away completely. It comes and goes, mostly in the evenings, I think. And it's worse in my hands, makes it hard to… well, to do things, you know? Like buttoning my coat or holding a cup of tea steady. It's not all the time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: "Pins and needles," intermittent, more pronounced in the hands, impacting fine motor skills… that's helpful. And you mentioned it’s worse in the evenings. Is there anything that seems to trigger it, or make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger it? Not really that I’ve noticed. Nothing specific. As for better… resting helps, I suppose. If I just sit down and put my feet up, it eases a bit. But it always comes back. And like I said, I don't have time to be sitting around! I deliver the mail, you know? Can't be doing that with numb fingers.
DOCTOR: I see. Delivering mail is quite physically demanding, so this is certainly concerning. To get a better understanding, let’s go through some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. Everything feels a little clumsy sometimes, especially when it’s tingling, but I haven't dropped anything or anything dramatic like that. I still manage to carry all the bundles, you know? I’ve been doing this job for… oh, goodness, almost thirty years. I'd notice if I was getting weak, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would, absolutely. Thirty years of experience carrying mail is significant. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin – perhaps any rashes, color changes, or dryness, particularly on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin is… well, it’s old skin, you know? A little dry, maybe, especially in the winter. But no rashes or anything unusual. I put lotion on, when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms at all – anything like dizziness, balance problems, changes in your vision, or difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No dizziness or anything like that. My vision’s a little blurry when I wake up, but that's just from getting older, I think. And no trouble swallowing or speaking. Honestly, Doctor, it's just this tingling. It's annoying, and I'm worried it's going to get worse and I won't be able to do my job. That's the main thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to rule out other possibilities. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a few years back, but it’s usually okay if I watch my salt. I take a little pill sometimes, when it gets high. Other than that… no, nothing really. I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest. Always too busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, managed with occasional medication. Do you recall the name of that medication, Teretha?
PATIENT: Um… Oh dear. I think it's a little white pill? I honestly don't remember the name. My daughter usually handles refilling it. She keeps track of all that stuff. I just take it when I feel a bit funny, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can look that up later. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. I've always been a healthy person, until this tingling started.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – had any medical conditions like diabetes, neuropathy , or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And my brother, he had some kind of… heart trouble, I think. But other than that, not really. They weren't much for going to the doctor either, my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. I’m Ukrainian, you know? We eat a lot of everything! No, I’m good. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to figure out this tingling. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, Teretha, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright. I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Just… please be quick? I have a route to finish, and Old Man Hemlock always gets mad if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as efficient as possible. Let’s begin. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table and extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright. Here.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's check your reflexes in your legs. Please extend one leg at a time. "Can you tell me when you feel this touch?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel it. There. And… there. It feels a little… funny. Sort of tingly even before you touch me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Teretha. It does sound like there is some altered sensation even without stimulation. Now, can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit weak, maybe? Hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and tell me which direction I am moving my finger. "Can you tell me which direction I'm moving my finger?
PATIENT: Up… No, down. No, left! Wait… is it right? Oh dear, this is silly. It feels… fuzzy. I can’t tell very well.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Teretha. These tests can be a bit challenging. Based on the physical examination and the information you've provided, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The altered sensation, weakness, and tingling suggest nerve involvement. Given your history of high blood pressure, one possibility is peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by damage to the nerves, sometimes related to blood sugar or blood pressure control. However, other conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, or even compression of the nerves, could also be responsible. To help determine the cause, I would like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid function test. We may also need to check your HbA1c to assess your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests. Well, I suppose so. If it will figure out what’s wrong. I really just want to get back to my route. My daughter can probably take me to get it done. Will it take long? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. The blood draw itself should only take a few minutes. As for the cost, it will depend on the specific tests ordered, and unfortunately, I don't have precise pricing information. However, I can write a detailed order form for the lab, and you can inquire about their pricing and potential assistance programs before proceeding. We can also discuss options for affordable testing if needed. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate the tingling, such as prolonged repetitive hand movements. You might also try wearing gloves to protect your hands and keeping them warm. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the blood test results and formulate a treatment plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week… alright. That's probably fine. Gloves… and avoid repetitive movements. That's… difficult, when you deliver the mail. But I’ll try. Yes, a follow-up appointment in one week is good. Just… please don’t make me sit here all day, Doctor. I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. I will ensure we are as efficient as possible. I have written the order for the blood tests and a detailed summary of our conversation. Here they are. Please take these to the lab and inquire about their pricing and assistance programs. I have also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you on August 9th at 10:00 AM. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: August 9th… alright. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong. And thank you for being quick. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I understand your urgency and will do my best to determine the cause of your symptoms. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon, and drive safely.
PATIENT: .
