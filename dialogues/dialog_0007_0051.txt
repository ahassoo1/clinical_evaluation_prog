DOCTOR: Hi Darl, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Let me see... well, my niece, she said I really ought to know my blood type. Something about... emergencies? I don’t quite recall all the details, honestly. She’s a very organized girl, that one. I just… need to find out what it is, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. Knowing your blood type is a good idea, especially as we get older. It can be helpful in certain situations, like, you know, if you ever needed a blood transfusion. We can definitely get that checked for you today. Just to confirm, is this the only reason for your visit, or are you experiencing any other health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no, that's it really. Just the blood type. Everything else is... well, old age, I suppose! A little creaky, a little forgetful, but nothing a good cup of tea can't fix. I don’t think there’s anything wrong wrong, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. “A little creaky” is perfectly normal as we get older! Alright, so we’ll just focus on getting your blood type checked today then. To start, do you have any known allergies to anything – medications, foods, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… allergies. Let me think… I don’t believe so. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to be terribly sensitive to certain perfumes, but that was… oh, a long time ago. And I’ve always been careful with what I eat. No shellfish, definitely. But not an allergy, just… a dislike. Do you need a list of things I’m allergic to? I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No list needed, that's perfectly alright. We're mainly concerned about anything that could cause a serious reaction, like difficulty breathing or swelling. So, no known drug allergies, no food allergies causing a serious reaction, and no latex allergy?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Definitely not. I’ve had all sorts of little pills over the years, nothing ever bothered me. And I certainly haven't noticed any trouble with… rubber bands or anything, have I? Oh, this is a bit confusing, isn't it? All these questions! But I trust you know what you’re doing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, and it's good you're letting me know what you don't have. Just trying to be thorough! Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just a little something for my arthritis, now and again. It's… a white pill, I think? And sometimes a pain reliever if my knee is acting up. Nothing fancy. My doctor back home, he used to handle everything. I… I can't remember the name of the pill, I'm afraid. It comes in a little orange bottle, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay, an orange bottle and a white pill for arthritis. That gives us something to work with. We can try to figure it out later. Don’t worry about it too much right now. Now, have you had any major surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Serious illnesses… Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young woman. A very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. That was a silly adventure. And… I had pneumonia, many years ago. A bad bout of it. But other than that… I think I’ve been quite lucky, all things considered. It's hard to remember everything after so long, you know? Everything just… blurs together.
DOCTOR: You have been quite lucky! That gives me a good start. One last few quick questions, and then we can get your blood drawn. Do you have any family history of any major medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history... That's a tricky one. My mother… she lived a very long life, but she had a weak heart, I believe. And my brother, he had something with his… sugar? Diabetes, perhaps? It was a long time ago and my family didn't talk much about these things. We were more concerned with enjoying life, I suppose. And my father… he was a very strong man, always healthy. I don't recall any particular illnesses on his side. It's all a bit hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Heart problems on your mother’s side, possible diabetes in your brother, and a generally healthy father. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Darl, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, if you're comfortable, we can just do a quick blood draw to determine your blood type. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's perfectly fine. A little prick is nothing. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust you completely. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind. My arms aren’t what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. And I’ll be gentle. Just relax your arm for me. Just a little pinch… all done. Okay, all finished. You'll need to keep pressure on this for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. I'll send the sample to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few hours. I'll have the nurse come in and give you a bandage. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't bad at all! A little sting, but nothing to worry about. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think so. Just… knowing my blood type will be a relief. Perhaps I should remember to tell my niece what it is, when I find out. She's the organized one, after all. Thank you again for your patience.
