DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Edric. It's... well, it's my muscles, mostly. They feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me more than it used to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Edric. Weakness in your muscles, you say. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? It was just a little bit at first, you know? Like, carrying groceries was a bit harder. Now, even getting up from a chair sometimes takes effort. It’s not constant, thankfully, but it's definitely more frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began gradually about three months ago, initially with difficulty carrying groceries, and has progressed to include effort with standing from a seated position. Is the weakness present in all of your muscles, or are certain areas more affected than others?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, a little bit. Not my face, thankfully. I noticed it more when I was helping a friend move some furniture last week. I just… couldn’t lift as much as I usually could, and my legs felt shaky afterwards. It’s weird. I don't feel pain, just... lacking strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the legs and to a lesser extent, the arms. No pain, just a sensation of weakness. That’s helpful to know. And has this weakness been consistently present, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yeah. Some days I feel… almost normal. Other days, like today, it's noticeable right away. It seems worse after I've been doing something physical, but even just sitting for a long time can make it feel worse too, oddly enough. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that causes it, honestly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: So it’s intermittent, worsened by both physical activity and prolonged sitting, and doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific. I understand. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No numbness or tingling. No dizziness. No headaches. My appetite's been normal, I guess. Oh! Wait. Sometimes, my hands feel a little… shaky. Not all the time, just occasionally. And I’ve been feeling more tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I don’t know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Occasional hand tremors and increased fatigue. Those are good things to mention, even if they seem minor. We'll consider everything. Now, Edric, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Not much to tell, really. I haven't been to a doctor in… probably five years? Just for a check-up. I’ve never had any major illnesses or surgeries. No chronic conditions. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but that was ages ago. I don’t take any medications regularly, not even vitamins.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical or surgical history, and you are currently not taking any medications. That’s good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My dad… he had some problems with his joints when he got older, arthritis I think. And my mom, she had high blood pressure, but that was controlled with medication. Nothing else really stands out. No one in my family had anything like this, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your father and hypertension in your mother. No known history of similar symptoms in your family. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as an insurance appraiser, mostly looking at car damage. It's a lot of sitting, to be honest. I try to walk a bit when I can, but it's not much. I live alone, I don't really have many hobbies. I eat pretty normally, I guess. I don’t smoke and I only drink occasionally, socially.
DOCTOR: Alright, sedentary occupation, generally healthy diet, no smoking, and occasional social alcohol consumption. Now, to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, thankfully. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Edric. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your muscle strength and reflexes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here on the table, please. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, and your pulse is regular at 72 beats per minute. Now, I’m going to assess your muscle strength. Could you please resist as I push against your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric, please resist as I try to bend your arm. Strength is good, but slightly diminished at 4 out of 5. Now, your triceps. Please resist as I try to straighten your arm. Again, 4 out of 5 on your triceps. Now let's move to your legs. Please extend your leg while I apply resistance. Okay, that’s a bit weaker – 3 out of 5 on your quadriceps. Now your hamstrings, please resist as I bend your leg. Hamstrings are also 3 out of 5. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are present, but slightly diminished. Overall, your muscle strength is reduced, particularly in your legs, and your reflexes are slightly diminished.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound good, does it? What does that mean? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Edric, and I appreciate you sharing that. The findings are not necessarily indicative of something severe, but they do warrant further investigation. The reduced muscle strength, especially in your legs, and slightly diminished reflexes suggest there may be some issue affecting your nerves or muscles. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess for any vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or signs of inflammation. I also recommend a creatine kinase level, which can indicate muscle damage. Finally, depending on the results, we might consider an electromyography and nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of your nerves and muscles more directly. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Okay, blood tests and maybe that EMG thing if needed. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get it fixed. Do I need to fast for the blood tests? And… will this be expensive? I don’t have insurance, as you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern, especially without insurance. I can write you a prescription for the blood tests and provide you with the approximate costs upfront. We can discuss potential options to help make them more affordable, such as a payment plan with the lab or exploring assistance programs available through local charities. The cost of the EMG, if needed, will be higher, and we can discuss that once we have the results of the blood tests. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She specializes in nerve and muscle disorders and can provide a more specialized evaluation if needed. Here are the prescriptions for your blood tests and the referral to Dr. Sharma. Once you have the results of the blood tests, please schedule an appointment with her. We can review the results together, and I will assist you in developing a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about these orders, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting, and then see Dr. Sharma after the tests. That makes sense. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and trying to help with the cost. I think that’s all my questions for now. I guess I just… need to schedule those tests and get it over with. Thank you again, Dr. Bakan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Edric. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. We are here to support you. I wish you all the best and hope you get some answers soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
