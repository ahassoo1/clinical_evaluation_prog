DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Let me see… ah, yes. It’s this… going to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, you see. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. I don't keep terribly good track of these things. It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it’s not painful, thankfully. Just… a lot of trips. During the day, it’s… noticeable, certainly. And… at night, too. I find myself getting up… once, sometimes twice. Perhaps more. It’s difficult to recall precisely. I apologize. It’s just… disruptive, mostly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Verbose. It’s good you’re noticing and that you’re here to discuss it. Disruptive is a good way to put it. Now, when you say "a lot," about how many times would you estimate you’re urinating during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky question. I truly don’t keep track. Let me think… before my afternoon tea, perhaps three times? And then… after tea, another three, at least. Maybe four. It varies, you see. It's not a consistent number. Is that helpful? I feel I'm being rather vague.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. It gives me a starting point. So, roughly 6-8 times during the day. And you mentioned getting up at night – once or twice, sometimes more. Do you find yourself needing to urinate a large volume each time, or is it more of a small amount?
PATIENT: Hmm… small amounts, I believe. Not… a flood, certainly. Just… regular, frequent small amounts. It’s not like I’m emptying my bladder each time. More like… topping it off, if that makes any sense. It's… frustrating, really. I don’t remember this being an issue before.
DOCTOR: Okay, small amounts, frequent trips, even at night. That gives me a better picture. Do you notice any urgency when you need to go – a sudden, strong need to urinate?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, sometimes. Not always, but… when it comes on, it’s rather sudden. It’s not a gradual feeling, if that makes sense. More like… a switch flips. Then I must go. It doesn’t happen every time, but often enough to be… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, so intermittent urgency. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Let me think. I suppose… the color seems normal. Not overly dark, not overly pale. And… I haven’t noticed any… sediment, if that’s the right word. No blood, thankfully. It looks… like urine should look, I suppose. I wouldn’t say I’ve been paying terribly close attention, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, color and appearance seem normal. Thank you for that detail, Mr. Verbose. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that’s a name I’ve heard, of course. I don’t believe I’ve been told I have it, no. High blood pressure… I’ve had my pressure checked at the pharmacy from time to time. It’s usually… acceptable, I believe. Perhaps a little elevated on occasion, but nothing alarming. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly, but… I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. They do blood tests, of course…
DOCTOR: Okay. Since you have Medicare, let me pull up your electronic health record to see what your previous tests have shown. Ah, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, and it is currently well-controlled with medication. No history of diabetes here. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Well-controlled is reassuring. I did have my appendix removed when I was quite young. A simple procedure, really. And… let me think… a hernia repair, perhaps ten years ago? It was a small thing. Nothing major, I assure you. And… that’s all I can recall, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and hernia repair. Good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he lived a long life. Heart trouble, I believe. My mother… she had… arthritis, I think. Nothing particularly… dramatic. And I have a sister, she's quite well, as far as I know. We don't see each other often, so I don't have much information. No history of… kidney problems, if that's what you're asking. Or diabetes, as far as I’m aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And lastly, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never have. Always thought it a rather unpleasant habit. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner from time to time, but… nothing excessive, I assure you. Perhaps one or two glasses. And I enjoy a good walk when the weather permits.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, and regular walks. That's good to hear. Alright, Mr. Verbose, based on what you've told me, and looking at your record, the most likely explanation for your frequent urination is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges, which can put pressure on the bladder and cause these symptoms.
PATIENT: BPH… the prostate? Is that… serious? I apologize, Doctor, I’m rather unfamiliar with such things. Does that explain why I’m getting up at night, and the… urgency? It’s just… concerning, you see. I’m not accustomed to these sorts of issues.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned, Mr. Verbose. BPH is very common and, in many cases, it’s not serious, though it can certainly be bothersome. The enlarged prostate can irritate the bladder, leading to increased frequency, urgency, and needing to get up at night. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is gravely wrong. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, including a digital rectal exam to assess the size and feel of your prostate. We can also do a urine test to rule out any infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? A digital… exam? Well, I suppose if it's necessary. I must admit, it doesn't sound terribly pleasant, but… if it will help determine the cause, I trust your judgment, Doctor. And a urine test, yes, that sounds… less intrusive. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the urine test?
DOCTOR: No special preparation for the urine test, just a standard sample. As for the exam, I understand it’s not the most comfortable thing. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. It’s quick, and it provides valuable information. If you’re comfortable, we can proceed now. We'll start with the urine test, and then move on to the physical exam. Would you like me to explain the exam process in more detail before we begin?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Perhaps a more detailed explanation would… ease my mind. I confess, I’m not entirely familiar with the… procedure. I apologize for my… hesitation, but I’m simply trying to understand what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. As I mentioned, the digital rectal exam allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. You’ll lie on your side, with your knees bent. I’ll apply a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. It may feel a bit of pressure or a brief urge to urinate, but it shouldn’t be painful. The exam itself takes only a few seconds. It helps me assess if your prostate is enlarged, if there are any irregularities, and get a better understanding of the cause of your symptoms. I know it’s not comfortable, but it’s an important part of the evaluation. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a moment to think about it?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As… unpleasant as it sounds, I suppose I’m ready. Please, proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would. And… perhaps distract me with conversation? Anything will do. The weather, perhaps. Or… current events. Anything to take my mind off it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbose. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’m happy to chat. The weather has been rather unpredictable lately, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: Indeed it has. One day sunshine, the next… torrential downpours. It makes planning a walk rather difficult. I was hoping to visit the botanical gardens next week, but I fear the rain may put a stop to that. I enjoy a good rose garden, you see. Do you have a favorite type of flower, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely idea. The botanical gardens are a wonderful place. As for my favorite flower… I’ve always been partial to lavender. The scent is so calming. Okay, Mr. Verbose, just relaxing your muscles… that’s good. Your prostate does feel slightly enlarged, but it’s smooth, and there aren't any particularly hard or tender areas. That's a positive sign. Now, I'll just remove the glove. Okay, all done. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it does seem likely you have BPH. The good news is, it's manageable. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – reducing caffeine and fluid intake before bedtime, and timed voiding, where you urinate on a schedule even if you don’t feel the urge. We can also discuss medication options if those don't provide enough relief. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable, Doctor. Lifestyle modifications… yes, I believe I can manage that. Reducing caffeine and fluids before bed… not a terrible hardship. And timed voiding… yes, I suppose a schedule might be helpful. Medication… I confess, I’m always hesitant about taking pills, but… if it becomes necessary, I trust your judgment. Are there any… side effects I should be aware of with the medication?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Verbose. It's always best to try lifestyle changes first. As for medication, the most common options are alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Alpha-blockers help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. Potential side effects can include dizziness or lightheadedness, and sometimes a stuffy nose. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the prostate gland over time. They can sometimes cause decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, but these side effects are uncommon. We’d start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. I can provide you with a detailed information sheet about each medication if you’d like. We can also discuss the risks and benefits in more detail. Would you like to proceed with a trial of lifestyle modifications first and then re-evaluate in a month?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe a trial of lifestyle modifications is the best course of action. I’d rather avoid medication if possible. A month… yes, that seems a reasonable timeframe. And yes, please, the information sheet would be most appreciated. It’s always helpful to have something to refer to. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… much better informed now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Here you are. This sheet details the lifestyle changes we discussed, as well as information about the medications. Please read it over carefully. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of symptoms, such as fever, inability to urinate, or significant blood in your urine, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been most thorough and… reassuring. I appreciate your patience and explanations. I will certainly follow your instructions and… monitor my symptoms closely. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbose. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and enjoy your walks, weather permitting!
PATIENT: .
