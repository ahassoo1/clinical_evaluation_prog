DOCTOR: Hello, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s August 2nd, and I see here you're 20 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’ve been having a lot of trouble with… going to the bathroom. Like, a lot. It’s been… going on for a bit now, I think? It’s hard to say exactly how long. It's just… diarrhea, mostly. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea can be really disruptive. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a lot," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… how much is “a lot”? That’s a good question. I guess… more than usual? I usually… go, like, once a day, maybe. Now it’s… several times a day. And it’s… watery. Sorry, that’s probably too much information. It just feels like I can’t… hold it sometimes. And it's been happening for a few weeks, I think? Maybe longer. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, it's important to be thorough. Several times a day for a few weeks is definitely worth looking into. And “watery” is helpful information. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any cramping or pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I know I should, but… it’s unpleasant. And cramping… sometimes, yeah. Not, like, awful pain, but… uncomfortable. A sort of dull ache, mostly in my stomach. It comes and goes. It feels… worse after I eat, maybe? But it's hard to tell. I've been trying not to eat too much, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood is good. And the cramping that seems to worsen after eating is something we’ll want to explore. Can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. Well, my husband usually does the cooking, so I don’t always know exactly what’s in things. But usually… breakfast is toast or cereal. Lunch is often a sandwich, like ham and cheese. And dinner… it varies. Pasta, chicken, sometimes rice. We eat a lot of potatoes, I think. We try to have vegetables sometimes, but… we’re not the healthiest eaters, I guess. I drink a lot of water, though! And… coffee, in the mornings. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. The coffee is good to know. And it’s helpful to have an idea of your diet. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt sick, just… uncomfortable. Nausea… sometimes, a little bit. Not throwing up, just… feeling a bit queasy. And weight loss… that’s a good question. I haven’t really been weighing myself. My clothes feel a bit looser, maybe? But I don’t know if that’s just… me. It's hard to say. I feel tired a lot, though. But I've been working a lot, so that could be it too.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness is worth noting, especially with the other symptoms. And the clothes feeling looser could indicate some weight loss. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Bacy. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? It's just… annoying, and I'm worried it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds. And when I gently press, you do have some tenderness in your lower abdomen, primarily on the left side. Not severe, but definitely present. I'm also going to check your temperature and pulse quickly. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Pulse is 72, also within the normal range. Given your symptoms and the tenderness I'm feeling, I want to order a stool sample to rule out any infection or parasites. We can also do a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Stool sample and blood test… okay. Whatever you need. I don't really understand all the medical stuff, but I trust you, Dr. Bacy. Is it… is it something serious, do you think? I mean, is it something I should be really worried about? I know you probably can’t tell me until you get the results, but… just a general idea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re worried. While it's too early to say definitively, the symptoms you’re describing could be caused by several things – a viral or bacterial infection, food intolerance, or even Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Less commonly, it could indicate something more serious, which is why we're doing the tests. The stool sample will help us rule out infection. The blood test will check for signs of inflammation. We’ll start with these tests, and then we can discuss the results and the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, eating bland foods – things like rice, toast, and bananas – and avoiding caffeine and dairy. We’ll also want to avoid any foods that might trigger your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medicine in years, to be honest. My husband usually handles all that. He'll know if I've had a reaction to anything before. But I don't think so. No, I don’t have any allergies. Okay… staying hydrated, bland food, avoid caffeine and dairy… and see what the tests say. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Dr. Bacy. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. I’ll have the lab order printed for you now, and the nurse will explain the collection process for the stool sample. She’ll also draw the blood for the blood test. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything really well. Just… thank you again, Dr. Bacy. And thank you for being patient with me. I get… forgetful sometimes, and I feel like I ramble. I think that's all. I'll just go talk to the nurse then, and get everything sorted out. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. It was my pleasure. Don't worry about rambling or being forgetful – that's perfectly normal. I'm here to help. The nurse is just down the hall, and she’ll take good care of you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
