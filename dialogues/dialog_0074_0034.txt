DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Reisig. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, so I figured I should probably do that. I don’t… really have anything wrong, not that I know of. Just new to the area.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Establishing care with a primary care physician is very wise, especially when you're new to a location. And utilizing your Medicare benefits is a great first step. So, we'll go ahead and get you officially established as a patient. I see here you're 21 years old, and your height and weight are noted as 150 centimeters and 82 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I think so. Everything feels kinda… blurry, remembering stuff. Is that okay? I mean, is it bad I don’t totally remember? I just… things haven't always been clear, you know? But yeah, those numbers sound right. I haven’t really checked in a while.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay, Emileigh. Memory can be affected by many things, and it’s not unusual to have some difficulty recalling precise details, especially if things have been… challenging in the past. We’ll take things at your pace. It’s more important that you’re comfortable discussing what you are experiencing now. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Um… I don’t really have one, I guess? Not that I know of. I mean, I’ve been to the doctor before, when I was little, I think. But I don’t remember what for. I've been pretty healthy, mostly. Just… normal stuff? I don't even know what to tell you. I'm married, if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's common for people to not have a detailed recollection of past medical events, especially if they occurred a long time ago. Knowing you are married is helpful, and we can certainly discuss your current health and lifestyle. Let’s start with this: have you had any serious illnesses or hospitalizations that you do recall, even if it was a while ago?
PATIENT: No… not really. I mean, I’ve had colds, like everyone, I think. And I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, maybe? But nothing… serious. I don't think so. I've never been in the hospital, I don't think. It’s all kinda fuzzy, sorry. Is it bad that I can't remember? I feel like I should know this stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all, Emileigh. Truly. It’s more important that we focus on your health now. We can always try to gather more information if needed, but it's perfectly acceptable if details are unclear. Now, how about any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I’m pretty sure. I would remember that, right? Unless… maybe when I was really little? I don’t know. I really don’t think so. I just... I get headaches sometimes. Like, regular headaches. Nothing crazy. I just take some pills for them. Over-the-counter stuff. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention the headaches, Emileigh. Yes, that is important. Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Um… they just… hurt. Mostly on the sides of my head. Sometimes behind my eyes. They come and go. Sometimes they're worse than others. Stress makes them worse, I think. And not enough sleep. I don’t really do anything special for them, just take… ibuprofen, I think it is? The white pills. I don’t know the exact name. They usually go away after a few hours. Is that bad? Should I be seeing someone about them? I didn't even know I was supposed to tell you about headaches.
DOCTOR: It’s very helpful that you’re sharing this with me, Emileigh. Headaches are common, but it’s important to understand their pattern and severity. It's good you've been managing them with over-the-counter ibuprofen. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical headache?
PATIENT: Okay… um… it usually starts kinda slow. Like, a dull ache at first. Then it gets sharper, and it feels like… pressure. Like someone’s squeezing my head. And it makes me kinda tired. I don't get sick with them, like, no throwing up or anything. Just tired and achy. Sometimes I get a little blurry vision, but that goes away when the headache gets better. And sometimes, like, bright lights bother me when I have one. That’s… about it, I think. I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Emileigh. You’re providing very helpful information. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing tension-type headaches, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of frequent or severe headaches, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… that's a hard one. I don’t really… know my family very well. I grew up kinda… separate from them. I know my mom had… problems, but I don’t really know what kind. And my dad… I haven’t seen him in years. I don't think anyone has headaches, but I really couldn't say for sure. Sorry. I wish I knew more. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s not always possible to have a complete family history, and it's understandable that the circumstances make it difficult. We'll proceed without it for now. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work, mostly. I’m a mechanical engineering tech… technician? I build things, fix things. It's okay, I guess. I stand a lot. It's… physical. I don’t really exercise, not really. And I don’t eat very well, I think. I grab whatever’s easy. And I don’t sleep a lot. Like, six hours maybe? When I'm lucky. I don't drink or smoke, if that matters. And… I'm married, like I said. My husband works too. He’s really nice. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Emileigh. Thank you for sharing that. Standing for long periods and a potentially less-than-ideal diet and sleep schedule could be contributing to your headaches. One last question for now: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t ever had a really bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken… lots of different pills over the years, for colds and stuff. Nothing ever seemed wrong. I don't have any food allergies that I know of, either. I eat pretty much everything. Does that sound right? I’m trying to think… but I really don’t remember anything bad happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. Thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like we have a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me, and given your history of headaches, I would like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. A physical exam sounds… good, I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work later. But yeah, go ahead. I’ll try to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We won’t keep you long. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam – that just means checking your balance, coordination, and vision. I'll also palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. There's some mild tenderness in your neck muscles, which is likely related to your work. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Your eye movements are also normal.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… not too bad. It feels kinda weird, but okay. My neck does hurt sometimes, especially at the end of the day. So that makes sense, I guess. I’m following it… is that right? It’s kinda blurry sometimes, when I’m tired, but it’s okay right now. Everything feels… okay. What do you think? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Everything seems alright at this point, Emileigh. The examination didn't reveal anything concerning. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect you’re experiencing tension-type headaches, likely exacerbated by your work and lifestyle factors. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some basic blood work. It’s just a routine check to ensure there isn't an underlying medical condition contributing to your headaches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Uh… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I don't really like needles, but… I trust you. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… is it expensive? I have Medicare, but I don’t know how much it covers. I don't want to get a huge bill. Is it something serious? Are you worried about something? Sorry, I'm just… nervous, I guess.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous, Emileigh. It’s good you're asking these questions. The blood work is a fairly standard procedure, and it's just a precautionary measure. It’s unlikely to reveal anything serious, but it’s best to be thorough. As for cost, Medicare should cover most of the expense, but there may be a copay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department can help you understand the costs involved. To be clear, I’m not overly worried. I believe your headaches are likely related to stress and muscle tension, but I always want to rule out other potential causes. Would you like me to order the blood work now?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. Let’s just do it. If it will make you feel better, and it will rule things out… then yes. Let’s get it over with. Where do I go? Do I have to come back another day? And… will it take long? I have to get back to work, you know? I don’t want to miss too much. And… will it hurt a lot? Sorry, I’m being annoying. I just… don’t like doctors very much.
DOCTOR: You're not annoying at all, Emileigh. It’s perfectly alright to be anxious about medical procedures. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable and answer your questions. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic. It won't take long – maybe 15-20 minutes total, including the wait time. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn't be painful, just a quick pinch. I’ll write you a requisition form, and then you can head over to the lab just down the hall. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your headaches. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… okay. Not too bad. A quick pinch, you said? And just a couple of days? I can manage that. Okay. So, I just take this paper to the lab, and they’ll do the blood work? Is there anything else I need to do? Should I eat something first? Or… not eat? I always forget these things. I’m so sorry. I feel like I'm making a mess of everything. But thank you. You’re really nice.
DOCTOR: You're not making a mess of anything at all, Emileigh. You're doing great. And you're very welcome. It’s my pleasure to help. Yes, you just take the requisition form to the lab, and they’ll handle everything from there. You don’t need to do anything special beforehand – you can eat normally. Fasting isn't required for these tests. I'll also give you a handout with some general information about tension-type headaches, including some self-care tips you can start using right away. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Reisig. You really put my mind at ease. I was really worried, but I feel a lot better now. Hopefully the blood work will be okay. And hopefully we can figure out what's causing these headaches. Okay. I'll go to the lab now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll work together to find a solution. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
