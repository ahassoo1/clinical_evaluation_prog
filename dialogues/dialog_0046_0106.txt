DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Hmph. Dr. Glowka, is it? Well, it's about time someone finally got around to seeing me. This foot… it’s been a bother. A real bother. It won’t heal, and it hurts. I've had… problems with the sugar, you see. Always have. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. It runs in the family. It’s just… inconvenient, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this foot issue for a while, and it's frustrating when something doesn't heal as it should, especially with a history of diabetes in the family. It is inconvenient. Let’s talk about this foot a bit more. When did you first notice the problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice it? Let me think... It must have been… March, maybe? Around Easter, I believe. I was getting ready for church, and I noticed a little sore on my foot. Didn't think much of it at first, just a blister, probably from my new shoes. But it didn't go away. And then it got… worse. It started to smell, and it’s been… draining. Honestly, it’s quite disgusting. I've been trying to keep it clean, but it's a losing battle.
DOCTOR: I see. So it started around Easter as a small sore, possibly a blister, and has unfortunately worsened over the past few months, with drainage and an odor. That does sound concerning, Ms. Cannington. You mentioned trying to keep it clean – can you describe for me how you’ve been cleaning it, and what, if anything, you’ve been using to dress it?
PATIENT: Well, I wash it every day with soap and water, of course. Regular soap. Not one of those fancy antibacterial ones, those are just a waste of money. And I pat it dry with a clean towel. Then I put a bandage on it. Just a regular Band-Aid, the kind you get at the store. Sometimes I use a little bit of that ointment, you know, the one for cuts and scrapes. Polysporin, I think it's called. My daughter, Leilani, told me to use it. She thinks she knows everything, that one. But it doesn't seem to be helping much. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to do. I’ve always been good at taking care of myself, but this… this is different.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been very diligent in taking care of it yourself, Ms. Cannington, and I appreciate you sharing that detail. Using soap and water and keeping it covered is good. Polysporin is generally fine for minor cuts, but given the history of diabetes and the fact that it hasn’t healed, it's important we take a closer look. Do you have any pain with this sore?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, yes, plenty of pain. It’s not constant, thankfully. It’s more of a throbbing ache, especially when I walk. And if I bump it against something… oh, goodness, it feels like fire. I try to avoid putting too much weight on it, so I’ve been hobbling around a bit. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to be so active, always gardening and going to church socials. Now… well, now I mostly sit. And the sitting doesn't do my hips any favors, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing a throbbing ache, worsened by walking and any accidental bumps, and it’s definitely impacting your activity level. It’s frustrating when pain limits what you can do, especially when you’ve been accustomed to being active. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to examine your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examine it, you say? Well, I suppose so. But don't poke around too much. I don't have a high tolerance for that sort of thing. And be gentle, alright? This isn’t some young person’s foot. It’s… experienced. And fragile. Honestly, I’ve seen better days. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll take my time and explain everything as I go. I’ll just need to take a look at the sore itself, check your circulation, and feel your pulses. It won't take long. Okay, Ms. Cannington, I'm taking a look now. I see some redness and swelling around the sore, and there's a small area that appears to be open. Your pulses are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but we want to monitor that closely. I’m also noticing some warmth around the area. Does that feel warm to you?
PATIENT: Warm? Yes, it does feel warmer than the rest of my foot, now that you mention it. I hadn’t really paid attention, to be honest. I’ve been so focused on the pain. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it smells awful, doesn't it? I’ve been spraying it with that odor eliminator spray, but it doesn't seem to do much good. Honestly, I’m starting to think I should just have the whole foot amputated. Is that… is that an option? My cousin, Kalani, lost a toe last year from the sugar, and he says he doesn't even miss it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington, and it’s good that you’re aware of your cousin’s experience. It's completely understandable to feel worried when something isn’t healing and is causing you discomfort. However, amputation is a last resort, and we have many other options to explore first. The warmth and odor are concerning signs, and suggest a possible infection. Before we consider any drastic measures, we need to determine the extent of the infection, if there is one, and rule out any other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I also recommend we get an x-ray of your foot to see if there’s any bone involvement. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Well, I suppose so. I don't like being poked and prodded, but if it's going to help… Alright. Blood tests and an x-ray. Make sure they don’t take too much blood. I get lightheaded easily, you know. And tell them to be careful with the x-ray machine. I’ve heard those things can cause problems. Honestly, all this fuss over a little sore… it’s a bit much, isn’t it? But alright, do what you need to do. Just hurry up about it. I have a bingo game tonight, you know. And I don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cannington. We’ll take just a small amount of blood, and we'll be very careful with the x-ray. We’ll prioritize getting these tests done quickly so you can get back to your bingo game tonight. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics to start addressing any potential infection. I’m also going to recommend offloading pressure from your foot as much as possible. Do you have any comfortable shoes that allow you to avoid putting weight on it?
PATIENT: Shoes? Well, I mostly wear slippers around the house. They're soft, you see. But they don't offer much support. And I have those sandals with the little straps, but they rub on my skin. Honestly, finding comfortable shoes is a nightmare. Everything either pinches or slips. I suppose I could try wearing those old tennis shoes, but they're a bit worn out. They're comfortable enough, I guess. But they’re not very stylish. And I like to look nice when I go to church.
DOCTOR: I understand. Comfortable shoes are essential, and it sounds like finding the right pair is a challenge. For now, let’s try the tennis shoes if they’re comfortable enough, and we’ll discuss some other options after we get the test results. If possible, try to limit walking as much as possible until we have a better idea of what’s going on. I'm writing a prescription for an antibiotic called Cephalexin. Take it twice a day for ten days, even if you start to feel better. It's important to finish the full course to ensure the infection is completely cleared. I’ll also send an order to the lab for the blood tests and the x-ray. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I never had much trouble with sickness, even as a child. Except for that time I ate a bad mango… but that was years ago. No, I don’t have any allergies. Just a general aversion to doctors, if that counts. And the smell of hospitals. That’s a terrible smell.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion, Ms. Cannington. Many people feel that way. We'll try to make your visit as comfortable as possible. Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. I’ve ordered the blood tests and x-ray, and a lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll be able to determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, please continue to keep your foot clean and dry, and take the antibiotics as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. Not really. I mean, I suppose… how long will it be before I get the results? I don't want to be waiting around all day. And will this antibiotic make me sleepy? I need to be alert for bingo. And… is this going to be expensive? My Medicare doesn't cover everything, you know. Honestly, I’m starting to worry about all this fuss. It was just a little sore, and now it’s turned into a whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Cannington. Let me address them one by one. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. We'll call you as soon as we have them. Cephalexin can sometimes cause mild drowsiness in some people, but it's not very common. If you do feel sleepy, please avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. As for the cost, we'll submit the charges to Medicare, and they'll cover a portion of the expenses. You may have a co-pay or deductible, but our billing department can help you understand the costs and set up a payment plan if needed. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you we'll do everything we can to get this resolved quickly and efficiently. We’re not going to let this little sore become a big ordeal. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. You've answered all my questions. But honestly, I still think it's a bit much fuss over a little sore. But alright, I'll take the medicine and get the tests. And I'll try to stay off my foot as much as possible. But if it's not better by tomorrow, I’m going to start thinking about amputation again. Just saying. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results. And hope for the best. And try to win at bingo.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. We will certainly explore all other options before considering more drastic measures. I am confident that we can find a solution to get you feeling better. The lab technician should be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I wish you the best of luck at bingo tonight! We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
PATIENT: .
