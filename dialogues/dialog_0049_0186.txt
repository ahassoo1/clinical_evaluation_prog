DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, morning to you too, Doctor. Uh, it’s about this tryout I’m doing. For the, well, it's a sports team. They want a checkup first, make sure I'm not gonna fall apart on 'em, you know? Just the usual, I guess. I’m trying to get this done quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: A sports team, alright. And you said just a general checkup… to ensure you're fit for activity. I see. Thirty years in this profession and these requests are… common. Let’s start with a bit more detail. What sport are you trying out for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, right, specifics. It’s… Mongolian wrestling. Buürekh. It's... well, it's wrestling. A bit different than what you see on TV, but. Lots of strength, and... endurance. It's a long match sometimes. Is this gonna take long? I got a practice later.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling. Right. Not a sport I’ve had many patients preparing for, admittedly. Strength and endurance, you say. Very well. Before we proceed with a physical, let's get some background. Have you been regularly active, or is this a recent undertaking?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm. Most of my life, yeah. It’s kinda… part of the culture, you know? Wrestling, training, even if it’s not for competition. Lately though... I haven't been competing regularly for maybe... five years? But I still train with some of the younger guys, keep my hand in. Does that make sense? It's not like I've been sitting on the couch.
DOCTOR: Five years of less formal competition… alright. And during those five years, were there any injuries or illnesses that required medical attention?
PATIENT: Injuries… well, a few bumps and bruises, naturally. Comes with the territory. Nothing serious, though. Pulled a muscle in my shoulder a couple years back, but I worked it out myself. No doctor, no hospital. Just… rest and liniment. And… I had a bad cold last winter, but everyone gets colds, right? Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Liniment and rest… I see. While I appreciate self-sufficiency, Mr. Kingan, it's important to have a proper record. We need to document everything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I was as tough as an ox. No, no allergies. Seriously. Food, medicine… nothing bothers me. Can we… get on with the checkup now? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Clean as a whistle. Both my parents lived to be old, healthy people. I think good genes help a lot. Look, Doctor, is this standard stuff? Because I'm feeling a little... antsy. It's just... time is tight, and this team... it's kinda important. Is there a way to speed this up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, a thorough medical history is essential, even for someone who considers themselves in good health. It is not simply about identifying current issues, but also assessing potential risks. However... since you insist, I will expedite the process. But do not expect a comprehensive evaluation. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nope. Never been under the knife. That's everything, right? No cutting, no sicknesses, just wrestling. Can we get to the physical part now? I promise I’ll hold still. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with your vitals. Please step onto the scale. And after that, we will proceed with a basic physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, lung sounds… and a quick assessment of your musculoskeletal system. I need to at least listen to your heart and lungs to ensure there are no immediate concerns. Now, please. The scale is over there.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s just get it over with. Hurry it up, if you would.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart rate is regular at 72. Lung sounds are clear, bilateral. Musculoskeletal exam… some minor crepitus in the knees, expected for your age and activity level. Grip strength is good, though. And reflexes are… normal. Now, can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. That’s walking. What do you think? Old man’s walk? I’m stronger than I look, you know. This wrestling keeps me in shape. Is that good enough? Can we just wrap it up? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Your gait is… slightly asymmetrical, with some decreased range of motion in the left hip. And you mentioned a shoulder injury previously. Can you demonstrate your range of motion in that shoulder?
PATIENT: There. Up, down, side to side. A little stiff, yeah, but it doesn't bother me when I’m wrestling. It just… cracks a bit. Old injury. Like I said, liniment and rest. It's just an old man thing, Doctor. Not gonna fall off or anything. So? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, while you appear reasonably healthy for your age, several factors warrant further investigation. Your elevated blood pressure, the asymmetry in your gait, and the unresolved shoulder injury… these are not things to be dismissed. I recommend a complete blood workup, including a lipid panel, and an X-ray of your shoulder to assess the extent of the damage. Also, an EKG would be prudent, given your blood pressure reading.
PATIENT: Wait, hold on a minute! Blood work? X-rays? EKG?! Doctor, I just need a checkup for a wrestling team! This is ridiculous! I told you, I feel fine! Liniment and rest have always worked for me! This is wasting my time! Look, I appreciate your concern, but I’m not going to spend a whole day running tests. I'm going to take my chances. I think I’m good. I'm leaving now. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I strongly advise against that course of action. Proceeding with strenuous activity without addressing these underlying concerns could result in serious injury. I understand your reluctance, but as a physician, I have a duty to provide the best possible care, and that includes recommending necessary evaluations. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for participation in a wrestling team without further investigation. I can provide you with a referral to a specialist for a more comprehensive assessment, and a list of affordable testing facilities. However, if you choose to disregard my recommendations, I must document your refusal, and I will not be held liable for any complications that may arise.
