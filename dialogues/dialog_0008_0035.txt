DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good while now, I suppose. Not constantly, mind you, but they just won’t go away. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that are persistent. A nuisance is a good way to put it, I suppose. And by “a good while now”, can you give me a rough estimate – days, weeks, months?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I’d say, sometime in June, maybe? So… about six weeks, give or take a few days. They come and go, but they haven't completely stopped since then. Sometimes just a few at a time, other times they keep coming for a good ten minutes. It's funny, really, because I can't think of anything that started in June that would cause it.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, alright. And you said it hasn’t been linked to anything specific you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. I haven’t been particularly stressed, haven’t eaten anything unusual… I mean, I enjoy a good spicy curry now and then, but that's been the same for years! I even tried drinking water upside down like my grandmother always said to, but that didn’t do a thing. It's just… there. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully. Just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated triggers and no pain, that’s good to know. Have you noticed anything else going on at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… Well, I have been feeling a bit… tired lately, now that you mention it. Not constantly exhausted, but just needing a bit more of a lie-in in the mornings. And my appetite hasn’t been quite as strong, maybe? I used to really look forward to my breakfast, but sometimes I just don’t feel as hungry. It's subtle, though. Could just be getting old, I suppose!
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and a slightly decreased appetite alongside the hiccups. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any major medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, sometime in the nineties. And I had a bit of a dodgy knee for a while, needed a cortisone shot, but it’s been alright for a good long time now. Otherwise, nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose! I used to be a psychiatric aide, so I’ve seen my share of… well, everything, but thankfully haven't had much trouble myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a knee issue, but otherwise relatively healthy. Any family history of anything significant – heart problems, cancer, neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s a bit tricky. My mother lived to be 92, very healthy woman, but she didn't really talk about illnesses. My father, he passed away younger, in his seventies, something to do with his heart, I think. And my brother, he had… well, he had some troubles with his memory later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. We weren’t very close, sadly. It’s not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. My doctor prescribed it a few years ago, just as a preventative thing. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I'll take a bit of paracetamol, but not regularly. Other than that, nothing. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer a nice cup of herbal tea, if that makes any sense!
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin daily and occasional paracetamol. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My skin's a bit sensitive sometimes, but that's just from the sun, I think. No breathing difficulties or anything like that with medication. I always used to be very careful with that, working in the hospital and all. You see things…
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a basic check.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Just let me know if it's going to be cold or anything!
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, but that’s common at your age and doesn’t appear concerning right now. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a bit diminished, also common with age. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. Do you feel dizzy or lightheaded often?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. I haven't felt dizzy or lightheaded at all, not recently. Sometimes I feel a bit off balance when I stand up quickly, but that’s just getting old, I suppose! It doesn’t last long, and I always hold onto something. Nothing to worry about. Is everything alright so far? You look very thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Everything is within normal limits for your age, Ms. Sucich, but the persistent hiccups along with the fatigue and decreased appetite do warrant a little further investigation. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we should rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. This will help us check for any underlying issues like anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or thyroid problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… Well, I suppose if you think it’s best, Doctor. I do trust your judgement. It's always best to be on the safe side. I haven't had a lot of blood taken lately, to be honest, but I can manage. Where would I go to get those done? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it doesn’t involve too much waiting!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can get those done right here at the clinic. I'll write you a lab requisition. The phlebotomist will be able to draw the blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. Results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. In the meantime, if the hiccups become significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe weight loss, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Two to three business days… I can certainly manage that. I'll make a note of it. And I will definitely contact the clinic if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this, and for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a bit, knowing we're checking things out. So, where do I go to see this phlebotomist?
DOCTOR: Just down the hall to your left, second door on the right. The phlebotomist, Maria, is expecting you. She'll take it from there. Once you’re finished, you can come back and we’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly. I’m very grateful. I'll head down to Maria now. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper.
