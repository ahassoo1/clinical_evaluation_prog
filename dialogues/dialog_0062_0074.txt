DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My blood pressure's been actin' up, that's why I'm here. Been feelin' kinda tired lately too, but I reckon that's just gettin' old. I just want to get it checked and make sure it ain’t nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're getting it checked out. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to keep an eye on. And feeling tired is good to mention, too – it could be related, or it could be something else entirely. So, when you say "actin' up," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, my daughter, bless her heart, she bought me one of them machines. You wrap it 'round your arm, right? She checks it when she visits. It's been high a few times now. Not every time, but enough to worry her, and honestly, worry me a little. I don't feel sick sick, just…off. A bit more breathless when I'm bakin', maybe. I do a lot of bakin', you see. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful that you stay so active! Baking is excellent. And it's good your daughter is looking out for you. Okay, so the blood pressure readings have been inconsistent, but high enough to cause concern. Do you happen to know what those readings were when your daughter checked them, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers ain't my strong suit, never was. She writes 'em down, though. Let me think… the last one she showed me was somethin' like… 150 over, oh, I don't know, 90, maybe? She said it was too high, said I needed to come see a doctor. She’s always been good with numbers. I just try to focus on the cookin', you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, 150/90 is definitely something we'll want to look into. That is considered elevated. Alright. And just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and occasional breathlessness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my head feels a little… full. Not a bad headache, just… pressure, like. And sometimes, I see little sparkly things when I close my eyes. It don't last long, but it's there. Happens mostly when I've been standin' a long time, bakin', you know? Could just be my age, though. I'm ninety years old, Doctor! Things are bound to start goin' wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are important things to mention – the head pressure and the sparkly things you're seeing. Don't dismiss things just because of your age, Venna. It's good you’re telling me all of this. Now, just a few more questions about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just from years of kneadin' dough. And I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, musta been… oh, fifty years now? Other than that, I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I eat pretty good too, mostly fruits and vegetables from my garden. And I don't smoke or drink. Never have.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about the healthy lifestyle! That definitely works in your favor. And good to know about the arthritis and gallbladder removal. Okay. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for the arthritis, now and then. It's called… um… I forget the name. It's a little white pill. My daughter gets it for me. I take it when my hands get real achy, but not every day. That's it, really. Just that one little pill. And sometimes, I take somethin’ for my tummy if I eat somethin’ that don’t agree with me. But that’s just when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for arthritis as needed, and something for your stomach occasionally. Do you know the name of the arthritis medication, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mind ain't what it used to be. Let me think… It starts with a “N”… No, maybe a “P”? She keeps it in a little bottle. It's... it’s a small pill, white. I really wish I could remember. I just tell her when my hands hurt and she gives me the right one. It's embarrassing to admit, but I rely on her for that sort of thing now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Venna. It's very common to have trouble remembering medication names, and it sounds like your daughter is a great help. We can figure it out later if needed. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had high blood pressure, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, she had a weak heart. She wasn’t able to walk much towards the end. I reckon that was heart trouble. And my grandpa, on my daddy's side, he had somethin’ with his kidneys, but I don't rightly remember what. We didn’t talk about sickness much back then. Just tried to get on with things, you see. That was a long time ago. Mostly, we just dealt with what was in front of us.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – a history of heart problems with your mother and kidney issues with your grandfather. And finally, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean, Doctor? I just live here in my little house, gardenin’ and bakin’. I see my daughter and grandkids when they come visit. I used to go to church, but it’s hard to get around now. I mostly just keep to myself, these days. It's a quiet life, but it suits me just fine.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Venna. A peaceful life is a good life. Okay, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again to get a current reading. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just try not to poke too much, my old bones are kinda creaky. Do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Venna. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 148/88. That’s still elevated, but not drastically different from what your daughter reported. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a new finding necessarily, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is a bit strong, but regular. Okay, everything seems relatively stable, but we definitely need to address the blood pressure. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine sample. These will help us check your kidney function, look for any underlying causes of the high blood pressure, and make sure everything else is working as it should. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a urine sample… whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I don't want to get too sick to keep bakin’ for my grandkids. They love my pies. So, if that's what it takes, let's do it. Do I need to do somethin’ special for the samples? I ain’t been to a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: No special preparation is needed for the urine sample – just a regular sample when you can provide one. The blood tests will require a little fasting – nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. We can give you a list with detailed instructions when you leave. After we get the results back, we'll discuss them and come up with a plan to get your blood pressure under control. This might involve lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, or medication if necessary. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. I can try to eat better. And I do a lot of walkin’ around my garden, that's exercise, right? I suppose I can cut back on the sweets a little, too. Though that'll be hard. But I want to feel better, like you said. So I’ll do what I need to do. Now, is there anything else I need to know? I don't want to forget somethin’.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful attitude, Venna. Any small changes can make a big difference. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will give you the paperwork, and they'll draw the blood tomorrow morning. We should have the results back in a few days. I'll call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment. For now, just focus on getting a good night’s sleep and stay hydrated. If you experience any chest pain, severe headaches, or difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, chest pain, headaches, breathin’ trouble… go to the emergency room. I'll remember that. And I’ll get the blood tests tomorrow mornin’, and I'll try to eat better and drink more water. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to an old woman like me. I reckon I'll be headin’ out now. Is there anything else? No, I don't think so. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. You’re not “just an old woman,” you're a valuable patient, and I’m glad you came in. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
