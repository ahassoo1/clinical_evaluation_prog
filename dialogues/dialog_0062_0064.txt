DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor! Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like a tight squeezing, mostly when I walk up the stairs. It started maybe a week ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago. And it’s a tight squeezing feeling, you said, mainly with exertion like walking up stairs?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Stairs are the worst. And sometimes when I'm carrying groceries. It goes away if I stop and rest for a bit. Not right away, but… maybe after five, ten minutes? It doesn't go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. Just… in the front of my chest.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So it's localized to the front of your chest, and relieved with rest after about five to ten minutes. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed if anything else brings it on, besides walking or carrying things?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. It’s not after eating, or when I’m upset. Just… using myself, I guess. Like, moving around. Maybe if I bend over too fast sometimes? But that’s not every time. It’s hard to say for sure. I haven't been paying that close attention, honestly, until it started bothering me more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly exertion related, and sometimes bending over. And it's been gradually worsening over the past week, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right! It wasn't so bad at first. Just a little uncomfortable. But the last couple of days… it feels stronger. It makes me nervous to do anything too much, you know? I don't want it to get worse. My husband, Ricardo, he worries too. He’s the one who made me come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good Ricardo is encouraging you to get it checked out. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, the doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high, but he never gave me anything for it. Just said to watch my salt. And I have Medicare, so I see the doctor regularly for check-ups, you know? He checks everything. But nothing bad, nothing serious. I used to have problems with my knees, but that's old. They don’t bother me much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing requiring medication, and some past knee issues. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago, when I was young, I had my appendix out. And… Ricardo reminds me sometimes, I had a small thing removed from my face, just a little mole. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Nothing else, I don't think. Definitely no big surgeries. It was all a long time ago. Before we came to this country, even.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed and a mole removed a long time ago. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any heart problems or other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had problems with her heart when she got older. She had to go to the hospital a few times. I think it was… something with the rhythm, not the squeezing like me. And my father, he had diabetes. He lost a leg because of it. But that was a long time ago, in Colombia. I don’t know much about their doctors, you know? It’s different there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart rhythm issues in your mother and diabetes in your father. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any pills. Just a little vitamin D sometimes, in the winter, because Ricardo says I don’t get enough sun. And no allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I don't have problems with bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, Sherion, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a look around. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm a little nervous, but I want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart sounds are… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not particularly loud, but it’s there. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. It feels… normal. I mean, I felt a little something when you were listening with the thing, but it wasn't pain. Just… aware of you touching me. Is that murmur… bad? What is a murmur? My mother used to talk about murmurs… but I don’t remember what she said.
DOCTOR: A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn’t always mean something is wrong. Sometimes it’s perfectly normal. But because you're having chest pain, and I’m hearing a murmur, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to do an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. We can also do some blood work to check your cholesterol and other levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what's going on, you know? EKG, X-ray, blood work… yes, that's fine. Will it take long? And will it hurt? I'm a little scared of the X-ray, I don't like those machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your nervousness. The EKG is very quick and painless. We'll just put some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs and it records the electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The chest X-ray involves very little radiation, and it doesn’t hurt at all. You'll just stand in front of the machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. It’s similar to getting a photograph. The blood work will involve a small needle prick in your arm, which some people find uncomfortable, but it’s very quick. We have a lab tech who’s very good at drawing blood, and they'll make you as comfortable as possible. I’ll explain everything again before each test. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Yes, that… does sound better. Knowing what to expect helps a lot. Sticky patches, a picture, a little prick… okay. And you'll be here to explain it? Ricardo will be so relieved I'm getting this checked out. He worries so much. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I eat something? Or not eat? I always get confused about those things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Yes, I’ll be here to explain everything. You don't need to do any special preparation for the EKG or X-ray. You can eat and drink normally before both of those. For the blood work, it's best to fast for about eight to twelve hours beforehand, so no food or drinks except water. Since it’s already August 2nd, you can have a light dinner tonight and then fast until tomorrow morning when we draw the blood. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The lab is just down the hall. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds… perfect. Eight to twelve hours, no food except water. I can do that. Ricardo can make sure I don't sneak anything! And the lab is close? That's good. I don't like walking too far. So, EKG and X-ray today, blood work tomorrow… Okay. I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so clearly. I feel a little less scared now. Where do we start with the EKG?
DOCTOR: That's excellent! I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. Let's get started with the EKG. If you could just lie down on the examination table, and I’ll place these sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs. It won't take long at all. Just relax and breathe normally. I'll let you know when we’re done.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I trust you, Doctor. That’s a little cold! But okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a few more. These patches help us record the electrical activity of your heart. It’s completely painless, just a little bit cool. Alright, we’re all set. Now, just try to lie still and breathe normally for a few minutes. I’ll let you know when we’re done. It’s recording now. We just need a few minutes. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: I’m feeling… okay. A little strange having all these stickers on me, but not uncomfortable. It's quiet in here, that's nice. I'm just thinking about Ricardo, and hoping everything is alright. Is it showing anything yet? I know it's probably too soon to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, the tracing looks… mostly normal. There's a slight irregularity in the rhythm, but it's not major. We'll need to look at the full report to get a better understanding. Alright, the EKG is done. Now, let's move on to the chest X-ray. The X-ray technician is just down the hall. They’ll explain the procedure to you, but it's very quick and painless. Are you ready to go?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Mostly normal… that's good to hear! Yes, I think I’m ready. The X-ray… just a picture, right? Lead me the way, Doctor. I’m trusting you to take good care of me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here we are. "Hi Maria, this is Sherion. She's here for a chest X-ray." Maria smiles warmly at Sherion. "Hi Sherion, nice to meet you! Please come in, and I’ll explain everything." "I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Take your time, and just let me know when you're finished."
