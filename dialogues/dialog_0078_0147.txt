DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I wasn’t sure if it was something serious, so I made an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a good idea to get it checked out. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks now, I think. It hasn’t gotten much bigger, if at all, but it’s definitely noticeable when I lie down. It doesn’t really hurt, exactly…more of a dull pressure sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, dull pressure, not sharp pain. That’s helpful to know. And you notice it more when lying down?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. When I'm sitting or standing, I don't really feel it. It’s when I'm lying flat on my back that it becomes more apparent. It’s… difficult to describe. Like a fullness, perhaps? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Amy. Fullness is a good way to put it. Now, has anything changed recently that might be related?
PATIENT: Hmm…not that I can think of. My diet’s been pretty normal, same as always. No recent injuries or… well, no big changes in my activity level either. I’ve been working, same as usual, choreographing. Just the normal stresses of life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes in diet, activity, or trauma. And you mentioned you're a choreographer – that involves physical activity, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a bit, actually. It’s not always strenuous, but it involves a lot of movement, demonstrating steps, correcting positions… things like that. I'm on my feet most of the day. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be. We’ll take everything into consideration. Now, let's talk a little bit more about the lump itself. Can you tell me where exactly it is located in your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Well, if you imagine… right here, a little to the left of my belly button. Not on my belly button, but sort of… below it and slightly to the left. It’s not super deep, but it’s definitely there. About the size of a plum, I’d say, maybe a little smaller. I can… feel it easily with my hand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a plum-sized lump, slightly to the left of your belly button. And you can palpate it yourself. Good. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – any changes in your bowel habits, any weight loss, any fatigue, any fever, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. My bowel habits have been normal, no changes there. My weight has been stable, I haven’t lost any weight. And I haven't been feeling particularly tired or had any fever. It’s really just the lump, to be honest. That’s what worried me enough to come in.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No associated symptoms. Now, let's go over some basic medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I’m aware. And no food allergies either. My wife always double-checks when we’re trying new restaurants, just to be safe, but she hasn't found anything so far.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any regular medication. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but nothing consistent. And no supplements, vitamins, or anything like that. I try to eat a balanced diet, so I haven't felt the need for them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and no current medications. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been quite healthy, all my life. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I had the usual childhood illnesses—chickenpox, measles—but nothing serious. I’ve always been careful to avoid getting sick, and I seem to have been lucky so far.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but that’s about it, as far as I know. No history of cancer or anything like abdominal problems on either side of the family. My parents both lived to a good age, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes in your parents, but no history of cancer or abdominal issues. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with palpating your abdomen, and then I'll listen to your bowel sounds. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'll lie down on the table now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amy. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. I'm going to press gently here... and here... Okay, can you tell me if this area feels tender?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't hurt. It feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, but not pain. It’s when you get closer to the lump that I feel something. Not sharp pain, still just that dull pressure. It's… more noticeable now that you're pressing on it, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. It feels… firm, not hard, and it's approximately 3 centimeters in diameter. It seems to be somewhat mobile, which is good. There's no significant tenderness upon release. I don’t feel any rebound tenderness, and you aren’t exhibiting any involuntary guarding. Your bowel sounds are normal – active in all four quadrants. Now, to be thorough, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And, given the nature of the lump and your concerns, I’d also recommend an abdominal ultrasound. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. An ultrasound seems like a good idea. And the blood tests, yes, please. Whatever you think is best to figure out what this is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center. The lab will draw blood now, and the imaging center will schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. You’ll receive a call from them within 24 hours. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your bowel habits, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and being so thorough. I'll wait for the call from the imaging center, and I’ll keep an eye out for any changes in my condition.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
