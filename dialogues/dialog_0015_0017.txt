DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Uh… physical, I think? For… the team. Yes, the team. My son, he… he signed me up. Something about tryouts. I don't really follow these things.
DOCTOR: A physical for a team tryout. Right. And how old are you, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Fifty-one. Though I feel… younger some days. Not as spry as I used to be, mind you. But fifty-one, yes. That's what the papers say.
DOCTOR: Fifty-one. And your son signed you up for tryouts… what kind of team are these tryouts for, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Baseball, I think. Or… softball? One of those ball games. Honestly, he doesn't explain much. Just said it would be “good for me”. A waste of time, if you ask me, but… a son wants something, you try. I haven’t swung a bat in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you had a physical exam recently, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm… not that I recall. Maybe… with my old wife's doctor? A long time ago, though. I mostly just take the pills they give me. Medicare sends them, you know? Keeps things… regular. I don’t bother with doctors unless something’s really broken.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… there's a little white one… for the blood pressure, I believe. And a yellow one… for… something in my feet? They ache, you see. And a blue one… honestly, Doctor, it’s a lot of pills. I just take what the little bottles say. I don't keep track. It’s all a bit of a blur, if you want the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to keep track. Do you happen to have a list of your medications with you, or perhaps the bottles themselves?
PATIENT: A list? No. Bottles… No, left them at home. My daughter usually handles that. She keeps a better head for these things. This is just… my lunch money and a coupon for the bakery. See? They got good bread.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you don’t have a list, we’ll have to proceed somewhat cautiously. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I used to get a rash from poison ivy as a boy, but that was… a long time ago. No… not that I know of. Maybe a little trouble with shellfish once? But my wife always cooked it, so I mostly avoided it. Not a big eater of fancy things, you see. Just… simple food. No allergies, really. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any serious medical problems in the past, such as heart trouble, diabetes, or any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious problems… well, this knee, for one. Bad from a fall years ago. Construction work, you see. Dangerous business. And… I had my appendix taken out. Long ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Just… aches and pains. Old age, mostly. You get what you pay for.
DOCTOR: A previous knee injury and an appendectomy. Do you currently experience any pain, besides in your knee?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes a little tightness here. Not bad, just… a little uncomfortable when I climb stairs. And my feet ache, like I said. Especially at the end of the day. It's just… getting old, Doctor. Everything starts to complain. Doesn't mean anything serious, I hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knee and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: I suppose so. But don’t go poking around too much, alright? This old body doesn’t take kindly to being prodded. And please, make it quick. I got things to do. Though I can’t remember what, exactly. Getting old… it’s a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88. A bit elevated. Knee exhibits mild tenderness and crepitus upon palpation. Range of motion is limited. Feet exhibit mild edema and some calluses. Pulses are present, but diminished. Alright, Mr. Bartok. I've completed the initial examination.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Figures. Everything’s breaking down. So? What does it mean? Am I fit enough for this… team thing? Or am I wasting my son’s time? And more importantly, mine.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is not uncommon at your age, but does warrant attention. Your knee exhibits signs of osteoarthritis, which is likely contributing to the pain and limited range of motion. Your feet show some edema, which could be related to poor circulation or prolonged standing. As for whether you are "fit enough" for this team… frankly, engaging in a physically demanding activity like baseball with your current condition carries some risk. While I'm not going to forbid you from trying out, I strongly advise against it without further evaluation and a structured rehabilitation program. I recommend a baseline EKG to assess your cardiac health, as well as an X-ray of your knee to confirm the extent of the osteoarthritis. I also suggest physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. We should also address the edema in your feet to rule out any underlying circulatory issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG? X-ray? Physical… therapy? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. All this for a little baseball? This is getting ridiculous. My son will never understand. He just wants me to… to be active. Not… poked and prodded and sent to a… a therapist. I don’t need any of that. Look, can't you just tell me if I'm allowed to play or not? Yes or no? No fancy medical words, please. Just… a simple answer.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration. However, providing a simple "yes" or "no" without proper evaluation would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. Your health is not a simple matter. Based on my initial examination, and without the results of further testing, I cannot definitively say that you are fit to participate in a physically demanding activity like baseball. To do so would be negligent. Engaging in such activity could exacerbate your existing conditions and lead to further injury. I strongly recommend following my advice and obtaining the necessary testing and treatment before considering participation. I can provide you with referrals to a cardiologist and a physical therapist. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? A… physical therapist? It's too much. Too much trouble. My son’s going to laugh. He'll say I'm making excuses. Never mind. Forget the tests. Forget the referrals. Just… tell me what will happen if I do play. Be honest. Even if it’s bad. Just… tell me. Don't sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you choose to participate in baseball without addressing your existing conditions, you risk exacerbating your knee osteoarthritis, potentially leading to increased pain, inflammation, and reduced mobility. You also risk straining your cardiovascular system, which could lead to more serious complications, especially given your slightly elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, the edema in your feet could worsen, leading to discomfort and potentially increasing your risk of falls. In short, you are increasing your risk of injury and potentially compromising your long-term health. I strongly advise against it. However, the decision is ultimately yours. I have documented your refusal of further testing and my recommendations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't think so. You've given me… enough to worry about. Thank you, Doctor. I think. Tell me… is there a good bakery around here? The one with the good bread. That might cheer me up. .
