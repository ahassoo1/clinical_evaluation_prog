DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… travel, yeah? Need… something for travel. My wife, she… she always took care of this. Before. Now I gotta… figure it out. I’m going… somewhere. Hot place, I think. Not cold like here.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something for travel.” Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? You’re the doctor! You’re supposed to know what people need when they travel. I just… go. She made the list, packed the bags. I don't... keep track of little things. It's not important. Just… pills. For not getting sick. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. It would be helpful to know where you’re travelling to, Mr. Tayar. Different places have different risks. And “not getting sick” covers a lot of things. Are you concerned about stomach problems?
PATIENT: Stomach? Maybe. She always had something for that. Little white pills. Everything for everything, she had. This trip… it’s to India. My brother lives there. I haven't seen him in years. It’s… important. But I don't want to be… sick the whole time. Like last time. Bad food. Very bad.
DOCTOR: India, right. Okay. And you’ve been there before, and had stomach issues?
PATIENT: Yeah. A long time ago. Before… everything. It was… spicy. Really spicy. And dirty. Everything was dirty. I got… very sick. Couldn’t leave the… toilet for days. She took care of me, gave me the… stuff. I just need the same stuff. Whatever it was. She knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you remember anything about what she gave you?
PATIENT: No! I told you, she did everything. Little pills, mostly. And maybe… a shot? I don't like shots. She said it was for… things in the bugs. Like… malaria. Is that right? Sounds scary. I just want to go see my brother. It's been too long. And I don't want to be sick again. You just… give me what she gave me. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand you’re stressed and want to avoid getting sick. However, I can't simply prescribe something based on a vague memory of "little pills." That wouldn’t be safe, or responsible. We need to determine what risks you face in the specific region of India you're visiting, and what preventative measures are appropriate. Do you know where in India you’re travelling to?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. She always said… Mumbai. That's it. Mumbai. Big city, lots of people. Hot, she said. And… crowded. Is that good enough for you? Honestly, this is too much work. She made it so easy. Why can't you just… look it up? Is there a pill for being annoyed?
DOCTOR: Mumbai, right. Okay. Looking at the travel advisories… yes, there are several recommended vaccinations and preventative medications for that region. And a very real risk of traveller's diarrhea. Now, regarding your medical history… have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? I don't... remember. She did them. Years ago, probably. Before... everything. I don't keep track of dates. I just… go to the doctor when she tells me to. Is there a list? Can you just tell me what I need? I don’t want to sit here all day answering questions. This is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I need to know your medical history to ensure I’m prescribing the correct medications and vaccinations. Simply guessing could be dangerous. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. She always said I had a cast iron stomach. Before… you know. Except that one time with the… shrimp. But that was years ago! I just... don’t remember being allergic to anything. Honestly, I think she would have known. She knew everything. Why are you asking me?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this differently. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. And I strongly recommend a blood test to check your immunity levels. It’s the safest way to proceed. Can we start with your temperature and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. She never made me wait around like this. Just... hurry up. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Do you experience shortness of breath with exertion, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Shortness of… what? No. I walk. I go to the market. I… do things. I don't… sit around. What does that even mean? Is my blood pressure bad? Is that why you're asking so many questions? She said I was healthy. She always said I was strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is slightly high, but not alarmingly so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's discuss travel-related illness prevention for Mumbai. As I mentioned, there are several recommended vaccinations, including Hepatitis A and Typhoid. And we should definitely discuss medication to prevent traveler’s diarrhea. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. Just… whatever she gave me when I got sick. Before. And… sometimes a painkiller for my back. It gets sore from… walking. But not always. Just sometimes. What kind of vaccine is Hepatitis? Does it hurt a lot? I really don’t like needles. Honestly, this is making me anxious. Can I just get something to calm my nerves?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, before we proceed any further, I need a complete list of everything you take, even occasional painkillers. This includes the name and dosage if you know it. The information is crucial for determining safe and effective treatment. And frankly, asking for something to "calm your nerves" without a proper assessment isn’t appropriate. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. The painkiller… it’s… Ibuprofen. Just the regular kind. From the shop. I don’t know the dosage. Maybe… two pills? When my back hurts. And… okay, look. She said I get… moody. Sometimes. When I think about… everything. She gave me something for that too. Little blue pills. But I haven’t taken them in a long time. I don't even have them anymore. Happy now? Is this enough questions for one day? Just… give me whatever I need to go to India and see my brother, okay? Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Ibuprofen occasionally, and a history of mood changes managed with… little blue pills. That gives me a better picture. Now, let's focus on getting you prepared for your trip. Given your history, I’m going to recommend the following vaccinations: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a booster for Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis. We will also discuss a short course of antibiotics for traveller’s diarrhea, and I strongly advise taking oral rehydration salts with you. I will also write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to take as needed during your trip, but I need to discuss potential side effects with you. Does that sound acceptable?
