DOCTOR: Hi Clearance, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Keeps coming back, it does. And…well, the waterworks haven’t been right either. Frequent infections, the doctor said were related to my kidneys.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in your side and some issues with frequent kidney infections. I see. Let’s start with the pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s mostly on my right side, lower down. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it's been happening quite a bit lately. Sometimes it feels like it goes right through to my back. It doesn’t really come with anything else, no fever or anything like that, just the ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache on your right side, lower down, sometimes radiating to your back. No fever, that's good. And you said it's been happening more frequently lately?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It used to be just every few months, maybe. But now…it feels like almost every other week, if not more. It's starting to worry me a bit, to be honest. It interferes with things, you know? Makes it hard to get a good night's sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Now, you mentioned frequent kidney infections. Do you recall when you were first diagnosed with those?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was quite a few years ago now. Maybe… ten years or so? The doctor at the time said something about my kidneys having… lots of little pockets, you see. Said it made it easier for things to grow. I can’t quite recall the proper name, I’m afraid. They put me on medicine for the infections each time, but they just keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, about ten years ago, diagnosed with kidney infections and something about "pockets" in your kidneys making you more prone to them. We'll definitely look into that further. Do you remember what medication you were prescribed for those infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. I take a lot of pills, you see, for different things. I think… a water pill, something for the blood pressure, and then a different one when the infection flares up. It was a white pill, I believe. I’m terribly sorry, I’m not very good with remembering names. My daughter usually handles all the medication organisation for me.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Clearance, it's very common to have trouble keeping track of everything. We can look up your medication list in the computer here. Before we do that, let's talk a little bit about your other health issues. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, that's why I take the water pill. And my joints ache something awful, especially in the mornings. The doctor said it's just old age, I suppose. Oh, and I had a touch of diabetes a few years back, but they got it under control with diet and exercise, thank goodness. Nothing else I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have high blood pressure, joint pain, and a history of diabetes that's currently controlled with diet and exercise. That's good to know. And how is your energy level generally?
PATIENT: It’s…not what it used to be, naturally. I get tired easily, especially if I’ve been doing anything strenuous. But I manage. I like to keep busy, you see. A bit of gardening, reading… simple things. It’s just… the pain and the tiredness combined sometimes makes it hard to do much at all. I mostly just rest when I need to, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, pain in your right side, frequent kidney infections, high blood pressure, joint pain, and a history of controlled diabetes with some fatigue. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, my mother had trouble with her kidneys as well, towards the end of her life. She was always tired and weak. I believe she needed… some sort of machine to help them. And my father, he had diabetes, and it caused him a lot of problems. That's about all I can recall, I'm afraid. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of kidney problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. That's helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, God rest her soul, always said they were dreadful for you. And I tend to agree. I always liked fresh air, you see. I prefer a nice cup of tea to anything else.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, mind you. Maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. It’s mostly for the taste, you see. I don't really drink it for any other reason.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a small glass of wine occasionally. Finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I can eat most things, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I recall. I might get a bit of a stuffy nose sometimes during allergy season, but nothing serious. My daughter always checks when she picks up my prescriptions, just to be sure. She’s very careful, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clearance, thank you for all that information. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I trust your judgement entirely. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear on both sides of your chest. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Hmm. Do you feel any pain right here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s it. Just a bit of a dull ache, like I described. Not sharp, but… noticeable. It’s been particularly sore there the last few days. It’s not unbearable, but it's definitely there. Like a constant pressure, you see? Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your right lower quadrant. It doesn’t feel acutely painful, but it’s definitely sensitive. Your abdomen is otherwise soft. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148 over 85. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I’d like to order some lab work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a urinalysis to look for any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain. And yes, the blood pressure is always a bit high, you're right. I’ve been meaning to get that checked more often. So, lab work is fine, absolutely. Where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The nurse will give you a requisition form. They’ll need a urine sample and a blood draw. It shouldn't take too long. While we wait for the lab results, given your history of frequent kidney infections and the pain in your right side, I think it would be prudent to get an imaging scan of your kidneys and abdomen. A CT scan would give us the most detailed view. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… hmm. I don’t believe so, no. I’ve had scans before, I think, but I can’t quite recall. My daughter usually handles all that paperwork as well. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Is it something I need to worry about? Should I be concerned? I've heard things about reactions...
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. Allergic reactions to contrast dye are possible, but they are relatively rare, and we take precautions to minimize the risk. We'll ask you some questions before the scan to check for any potential allergies or kidney problems. The radiologist will also review your medical history. While we wait for the lab and scan results, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. It's not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief. We’ll also keep a close watch on your blood pressure. I'll write you a prescription for naproxen, 500mg twice daily as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Naproxen, twice daily as needed. I’ve taken something like that before, I think. It's good to know we're being cautious. And keeping a close watch on the blood pressure is sensible too. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a bit. So, lab work and a scan, and the pain relief... Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clearance. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave, including instructions for the lab work and scan. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. If your pain worsens significantly, you develop a fever, or you experience any difficulty urinating, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. Otherwise, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Emergency room if things worsen, rest and fluids, and we’ll schedule a follow-up. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. I’ll see the nurse now, I suppose?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clearance. I’m glad I could help. Yes, the nurse is just outside, and she'll get you all set up. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
