DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you as well. Um, it's a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been feeling… weaker, I suppose. And my eyelids, they feel heavy, like they’re drooping. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling weak and having heavy, drooping eyelids… that definitely warrants a look. “A little while now” – can you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? At first, I just thought I was tired, working long hours. But it hasn’t gotten better, and if anything, it’s slowly gotten worse. I notice it more at the end of the day, definitely. It's not constant, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, and gradually worsening, more pronounced at the end of the day. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms. I have been a bit more… clumsy, I guess? Dropping things. Not constantly, but more often than usual. And… this might sound strange, but sometimes my vision feels a little blurry, but it comes and goes. It's hard to tell if it's related, though. I haven't been to the optician recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness and intermittent blurry vision in addition to the weakness and drooping eyelids. Those could potentially be related. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Actually… yes. My appetite hasn't been great, to be honest. I'm not really hungry much. And… I think I’ve lost a bit of weight? I haven't weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel a bit looser. It's not a huge amount, but… noticeable. I've been a bit stressed lately with… things, so I figured it was that.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss, along with the other symptoms. Stress can certainly contribute to those things, but it’s good we’re looking into everything. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty swallowing. And my voice feels… normal, I think. No one’s mentioned anything. I did have a bit of a sore throat last month, but that cleared up quickly. It was just a normal cold, I thought.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you noticed any muscle twitches or cramps, or any unexplained bruising?
PATIENT: Muscle twitches… hmm. Not really. Maybe occasionally, a little flicker in my eyelid, but I thought that was just stress. No cramping, and no bruising that I’ve noticed. I do get the odd headache, but… I get those sometimes anyway. I wouldn't say they've been worse recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant muscle twitches, cramps, or increased bruising. Occasional headaches, but nothing new. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a child, and a broken arm when I was younger, but nothing major. No ongoing illnesses or anything like that. And I haven't had any surgeries. My parents are both relatively healthy, although my father has high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical or surgical history. Father has high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take anything regularly. I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but that's it. Just over-the-counter, when I need it. I try to avoid medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and haven’t had any issues with pollen or… well, anything, really. I'm quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t had any alcohol in several months. And no, I don't use any recreational drugs. Never have. I work long hours, though, as I mentioned. A lot of time at the computer.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drug use, and long hours working at a computer. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I am a little concerned, so I’m trusting your expertise. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take things one step at a time. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me… okay, blood pressure is 128/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, regular. Your temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes… Could you follow my penlight with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? I'm trying my best to keep them steady. It's a little difficult, I haven’t had my eyes checked in ages. Is everything alright? It feels… a bit strange to have a light shone in my eyes like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. You’re doing great. It is a little unusual, I understand. I'm checking the movement of your eyes and the size of your pupils. Now, I’m going to ask you to look straight ahead, and I’ll gently wiggle my finger in your peripheral vision. Just let me know when you can see it. Can you see my finger when I hold it here on the left side?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it. It's a little blurry, but I can definitely see something moving. What are you looking for exactly? I don't want to interfere, but… I'm a bit anxious, so I'm trying to understand what’s happening. It feels like my vision is a bit… patchy, if that makes sense. Especially on the edges.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful. “Patchy” is a good description. Now, let’s try the right side. Can you see my finger when I hold it here on the right?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it… but it's a little fainter on this side, I think. Not as clear as on the left. It's definitely a bit… dimmer. Is that normal? It feels like my peripheral vision is getting worse as we go. I don't usually notice these things, but… now that you're asking, it's quite pronounced. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so observant. That’s very helpful information. I’m going to move on and check your ears and throat, and then we'll do a quick neurological assessment. This might be a little cool... just relax. Say “Ahhh” for me…
PATIENT: Ahhh… Is everything alright? It doesn’t seem to be sore, but… I can’t really tell, can I? I’ve had a bit of a tickle in my throat lately, but I thought it was just a cold. It's hard to tell with all these symptoms overlapping.
DOCTOR: Everything looks reasonably normal in your throat – no significant redness or swelling. Your tonsils look fine. Now, let’s move on to a quick neurological assessment. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Just relax your leg for me…
PATIENT: Okay… Is that good? It felt a bit weak, I think. I’m not usually very good at these things, I've never had a proper physical exam before. Are you able to tell something is wrong? I'm getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: That was a little quieter than I’d expect. It’s not drastically reduced, but slightly diminished. It could be a number of things, and we’re gathering information to try and determine the cause. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Just squeeze as hard as you can, and tell me when you’re squeezing.
PATIENT: I'm squeezing now. Is that enough? It feels… a bit difficult, actually. It feels weaker than my left hand, I think. My right hand feels like it’s struggling a little. I don’t know if that’s just me being nervous, but it definitely feels… less strong. I’m really starting to worry now. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. I am noting that your grip is slightly weaker on your right hand compared to your left. Gedalya, I’ve completed the initial physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed – the weakness, drooping eyelids, patchy peripheral vision, and slightly diminished reflexes and grip strength – I'm concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests to check for any underlying inflammation, vitamin deficiencies, or other abnormalities. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help us rule out any serious conditions. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. A neurological issue? What kind of neurological issue? Is it… is it something I should be really worried about? I was hoping it was just stress, or maybe a vitamin deficiency, but… What are the possibilities? And how long will it take to get the results? This is all very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it’s completely valid to feel frightened. An MRI is a very sensitive imaging test, and it allows us to visualize the brain in detail. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. As for possibilities, it could be a number of things. Some possibilities include a nerve compression, a muscle disorder, or, less commonly, a more significant neurological condition. It’s too early to say without the MRI results. I want to emphasize that we are being proactive. Catching things early is always best, and we're gathering information to determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood tests should come back within a few days. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule – usually a week or two, depending on availability – and the results will take another few days to interpret. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any family history of neurological conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My parents are both relatively healthy, as I mentioned. My father has high blood pressure, but nothing neurological. My grandparents… I didn’t know them very well, and I don’t think my parents ever mentioned any neurological issues. What are the… the symptoms of these things you mentioned? Nerve compression, muscle disorder… I'm trying to prepare myself, I suppose. And what if it is something serious? What kind of treatment would I need? This is all… a lot.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. It’s good that you’re asking questions. Nerve compression, like carpal tunnel syndrome, can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling in the hands and arms. Muscle disorders, like myasthenia gravis, can cause muscle weakness that worsens with activity. These are just examples, and it’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have the MRI results. If it is something more significant, treatment options will vary depending on the diagnosis. Some conditions can be managed with medication, others may require physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery may be necessary. I will thoroughly discuss all treatment options with you once we have a definitive diagnosis. For now, I want you to focus on getting rest and avoiding any activities that worsen your symptoms. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion once we have the MRI results. It’s always good to have another expert review the findings. Do you have any questions about the MRI procedure itself?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I’ve heard it’s… loud? And you have to lie very still? Is it painful? I’m claustrophobic, I think, a little bit. Will I be in a very small space? I don't know if I can handle being confined. This is all… a lot to process. And… how much will all of this cost? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the procedure and the cost – it's important to be prepared. The MRI machine is quite large, and it does make a loud knocking noise. We can provide you with earplugs or headphones to help with that. You will need to lie very still for about 30-60 minutes. You are correct, the space can feel confined for some people. If you’re claustrophobic, we can discuss options such as an open MRI, which is less enclosed, or a mild sedative to help you relax during the procedure. Please let me know if you think you will have trouble with this, and we will find a solution that works for you. As for the cost, without insurance, the MRI can be quite expensive – typically around $800 to $1500. I will have my billing department contact you to discuss potential payment plans or financial assistance options. We can also explore options such as a cash discount or looking for a lower-cost imaging center. We will do our best to find a solution that works within your budget. For now, let’s focus on scheduling the MRI. Would you like me to contact you with available dates and times?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Perhaps next week? I need a little time to… prepare myself, both mentally and financially. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient and understanding. It's a lot to take in. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Taking your time is perfectly fine. I understand this is a lot to process. I’ll have my scheduling department contact you with available dates next week. They can also discuss payment options with you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, severe weakness, or vision changes – please contact the office immediately. Here’s a summary of our plan: 1. Schedule an MRI of your brain. 2. Contact my billing department to discuss payment options. 3. Follow up with me once the MRI results are available. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. I’ll wait to hear from your scheduling department. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We’re here to help. .
