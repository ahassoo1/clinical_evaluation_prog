DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguió. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's August 2nd. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I'm here for a vaccination, if that's right. I think it's time for a booster, but honestly, I get a bit mixed up with which ones I’ve had and when. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all, Mr. Paguió. It is easy to get those dates mixed up. We can definitely sort that out. To make sure we get you the correct booster, let’s start with a quick review of your vaccination history. I see here you've had the initial COVID-19 vaccine series – Moderna, completed back in March of 2021. And a booster on November 15th, 2022. Is that information accurate as far as you remember?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! Moderna… and November 2022… you’re very good! I remember feeling a bit achy after the first one, but nothing too bad. And November… yes, that rings a bell. I think I had a little bit of a cold around then, so maybe that’s why I remember. So, that means it is time for another one, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. According to the current CDC recommendations, and considering your age and previous vaccination schedule, you are due for an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Are you familiar with the updated vaccines?
PATIENT: Updated vaccines? Not really, no. I thought the original ones were supposed to be good for a long time? What’s different about these new ones? Is it because things changed with the virus? I don't pretend to understand all the science, I just want to stay healthy!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Paguió. You're right to ask. The virus has changed over time – it mutates. The original vaccines were very effective against the initial strains, but the new updated vaccines are designed to target the currently circulating variants – XBB.1.5, for example – which are more common now. It's like updating the software on your phone to protect against the latest threats. It’s recommended to get an updated vaccine to maintain the best protection. Would you like me to explain the different types of updated vaccines available?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That makes sense about the updates, like the phone software. I hadn't thought of it that way. What kinds are there? And… are there any side effects I should be aware of? I don't mind a little soreness, but I'd like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Currently, we have both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna updated COVID-19 vaccines available. They are both mRNA vaccines, similar to the ones you received before, and have been shown to be equally effective. The most common side effects are usually mild and temporary – pain or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, and fever. These typically resolve within a day or two. More serious side effects are very rare, but we always monitor patients after vaccination. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before proceeding?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Nothing to food or medication, certainly. I've never had a reaction to a shot before, as far as I can remember. Hmm… the handout says there’s a small risk of myocarditis. That sounds scary. Is that common? I feel a bit nervous now, actually. It’s good to be prepared, but that sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Paguió. It's good you asked. Myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – is a rare side effect, and it’s more common in young men after the second dose of the mRNA vaccines. The risk after a booster dose is even lower. And, when it does occur, it’s usually mild and resolves quickly with treatment. The benefits of vaccination – protecting yourself from severe illness, hospitalization, and long-term complications from COVID-19 – significantly outweigh the very small risk of myocarditis. But I understand your concern. Do you want me to review any other potential side effects with you, or would you like to proceed with the updated booster today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough information for now, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and honestly, I think I’m leaning towards getting it done. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. It's just… I don't like feeling poorly, even for a day. Would you recommend one brand over the other? Do some people have better reactions to one versus the other?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Paguió. And wanting to minimize any discomfort is perfectly understandable. Based on the data available, there’s no significant difference in side effect profiles between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna updated vaccines. Some people report slightly more fatigue with Moderna, but it’s not a consistent finding. Since you’ve had Moderna previously with no significant issues, I would recommend continuing with Moderna. We can give you the booster today. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Moderna it is! And today works fine. Hopefully, the side effects won’t be too bad. Where do I sit for the shot? And… how long do I need to stay afterwards to make sure I’m okay? I always worry about fainting!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Right this way. We’ll have you sit right here. Our nurse, Maria, will administer the shot. She's very skilled and gentle. We'll have you sit for 15 minutes afterwards, just to monitor for any rare immediate reactions. Maria will check your vital signs and make sure you're feeling okay before you leave. Don't worry about fainting – it's very rare, but we’re prepared if it happens. Just let Maria know if you start feeling lightheaded or dizzy, and she’ll take excellent care of you. We also have a comfortable room if you prefer to sit down during the shot. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Fifteen minutes is good. And thank you for mentioning the room. That might be a good idea, actually. I appreciate you being so thorough and patient with all my questions. I always worry, I suppose. Maria, you said? I’ll let her know if anything feels off. Thank you both!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguió. We’re happy to answer any questions you have. Maria will be right with you. And don’t hesitate to speak up if anything at all feels off. We want you to have a comfortable experience. .
