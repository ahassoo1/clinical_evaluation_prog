DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's good to meet you as well. I suppose I've been feeling rather… thirsty, and hungry, lately. More than usual, at least. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I’d like to finish this quickly if possible, I have a delivery schedule to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Christen. We’ll do our best to be efficient. Increased thirst and hunger over several weeks is worth investigating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Well… it’s just that I find myself constantly reaching for a drink, even after having a good amount. And I’m eating… more than I normally would, but I don’t seem to feel any more satisfied. It’s… disconcerting, to be honest. I don't know if that makes any sense. I haven't changed my diet or anything, not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Christen. A change in appetite and thirst without a corresponding change in diet is noteworthy. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not that I can recall. I’ve been a bit… tired, perhaps. But I work long hours, so that’s not entirely unusual. I suppose I’ve also been going to the bathroom more often, but again, could be the fluids. Is that… is that something I should mention? I’m really not sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, Christen, that is something to mention. Increased urination alongside increased thirst is definitely relevant. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, and a broken wrist when I was a lad, but nothing… serious. No ongoing conditions, no. I'm generally quite healthy, if you don't mind me saying so myself. I try to eat well when I can, despite the hours. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Christen. And no, it shouldn't be overly long. Just a few more questions to rule things out. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… No. Not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was very young, but that was… decades ago. That's all. Nothing since. I remember it being quite painful, but that was a very long time ago. Is that… relevant? I really do apologize if I'm being difficult; I just don’t spend much time at doctors’ offices.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Christen. It’s perfectly normal to be unsure. Knowing about your tonsillectomy is helpful, thank you. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… they’re both gone now. And I wasn't particularly close to either of them, I'm afraid. I don’t know much about their medical histories, if I'm honest. My father… he worked in the shipyards, and my mother… she kept the house. I believe my father had some trouble with his heart later in life, but beyond that… I wouldn’t know. I apologize again. This is all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Christen. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can proceed without it. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My work is physical enough as it is. I do enjoy a pint or two with my supper on occasion, but nothing excessive. Perhaps one or two on a Friday, if I'm feeling particularly weary. Does that… matter? I'm trying to be as helpful as possible, I assure you. This schedule is… demanding.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Christen. Occasional alcohol consumption is unlikely to be a factor. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've taken over-the-counter pain relievers for aches and pains, but nothing serious. I did have a rather nasty rash once after being stung by a nettle, but that wasn't an allergy, as far as I can tell. I'm generally quite robust, if you don't mind my saying so. This is taking rather a long time, isn’t it? I do appreciate your thoroughness, but… my deliveries.
DOCTOR: It is taking a bit of time, Christen, and I apologize for that. We're almost finished with the initial questioning. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I prefer to let my body do its own thing, if you understand me. I eat a decent enough diet, and I try to get enough rest when I can. Though, admittedly, that’s not often. I do occasionally take a multivitamin if I'm feeling particularly run down, but that's about it. Is that everything? I must confess, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious about getting back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen. That completes the initial questioning. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick examination of your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take too long, Doctor. I really must get back to my deliveries. I appreciate your efficiency, truly. Please, proceed. I’ll try to remain as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slightly rapid rate. Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little discomfort. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache. I hadn't really paid it much attention, to be honest. I put it down to overexertion. Lifting heavy crates all day, you see. It comes and goes, really. Mostly after a particularly strenuous shift. Is that… concerning? I must confess, I’m starting to feel a little uneasy. My schedule… it’s quite demanding, and I’m not sure what I’d do if I were unable to work.
DOCTOR: The tenderness, combined with your elevated blood pressure and increased thirst and hunger, warrants further investigation, Christen. While it could be due to overexertion, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us identify any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. It will mean taking time off work, won’t it? And I’m already behind schedule… Is there any way to expedite the results? I really do need to know what’s going on as quickly as possible. The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to my deliveries. I apologize for being difficult, Doctor. It’s just… my livelihood depends on this. And I haven’t got time for… prolonged illness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Christen. I will certainly do my best to expedite the results. We can usually have them back within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to order a urine sample as well, just to rule out any infection. Based on your symptoms and preliminary findings, I'm also leaning towards recommending a referral to an endocrinologist. They specialize in hormone imbalances, which could be contributing to your increased thirst and hunger. However, let's wait for the blood test results before making a definitive decision. I'll have the lab requisition and a referral form ready for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: An endocrinologist… No, not at the moment, I suppose. Just… the blood tests, and the urine sample. And the results as quickly as possible, please. I’m… anxious, to be frank. This is all rather unsettling. I just want to get back to normal. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions or… anything? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I'm just… trying to understand what's going on. And to minimize disruption to my schedule.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Christen. That’s what I’m here for. For now, I don’t recommend any specific dietary restrictions. Continue to eat and drink as you normally would, but try to stay hydrated. Avoid excessive caffeine or sugary drinks. The most important thing is to get the blood tests done as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can determine the best course of action. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as blurred vision, extreme fatigue, or unexplained weight loss – please contact me immediately. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. I've made a note to call you personally. Do you have any final questions before we finish?
