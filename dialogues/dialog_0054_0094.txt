DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… good morning. Yes. The lady on the phone… she say I need to come for… talking? I work with metal. Sheets. Big sheets. Not… sick. Just… learn things. I think. It was something about… learning. My husband say I should come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. It sounds like you were scheduled for an occupational health assessment – a check-up to make sure your work with metal sheets isn't causing any health issues, and to learn about safety practices. That’s perfectly alright. Your husband sounds like a caring man, and it's good he encourages you to prioritize your health. So, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the type of metal you work with, and what your typical workday looks like?
PATIENT: Metal… it’s… shiny. Silver mostly. Sometimes… other colors. I cut it. Bend it. Make… shapes. For buildings. I think. My hands do the work. My brain… not so much. I use… big scissors. And a… hammer thing. All day. Stand up. Bend down. Stand up. Very tiring. No breaks, sometimes. Foreman yell a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work with silver-colored metal, cutting and bending it into shapes for buildings. It sounds like a physically demanding job, standing and bending all day. And it sounds like the work environment can be stressful, with the foreman yelling. Do you notice any specific aches, pains, or discomfort after a day of work?
PATIENT: Aches? Always. My back. Mostly. And… fingers. They get… stiff. Like old lady fingers. Hard to grip things sometimes. I just… rub them. And take… something. Pink pill. Husband give me. Helps a little. Not much, though. And… sometimes, dust. Gets in my nose. Makes me cough. But it’s… work. Everyone coughs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you experience back pain and stiffness in your fingers, especially after work. You manage the pain with a pink pill your husband gives you, and you've noticed some dust exposure causing coughing. It’s good you’re aware of these things, even if it feels normal because of the job. Just to be thorough, could you tell me the name of the pink pill, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t ask. Husband gives me. He knows things. I just… take it. Small pill. Pink. That’s all I know. He say it's for… aches. And to… calm me down. He worry about my temper. Foreman make me angry sometimes. The yelling. It’s… hard to explain. He just want me to be quiet and work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t know the name. We can try to figure it out later. It’s good your husband is looking out for you. Let’s talk about the dust for a moment. How long have you been coughing from the dust?
PATIENT: A long time. Since… I started working with metal, I think. Maybe five years? Hard to remember. It's… always dusty. Everyone has a cough. Like a… normal thing. I use a… cloth. Over my face. Not very good cloth. Thin. Dust still gets in. It makes my throat… scratchy. Sometimes, hard to breathe. But I just… keep working. Can't stop. Need the money. Husband… he needs money too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the cough has been present for about five years, since you started working with the metal, and it’s accompanied by a scratchy throat and occasional difficulty breathing. You’ve been using a thin cloth to cover your face, but the dust still gets in. Just to get a clearer picture, would you say the difficulty breathing happens frequently, or only occasionally when the dust is particularly bad?
PATIENT: Occasionally. When the foreman make us work faster. He push, push, push. More dust. More noise. More… everything. Then I cough a lot. And… feel tight. In my chest. Like someone sitting on it. I slow down a little. But he yell. So I… keep going. Don't want trouble. He can… fire people, you know? Then what?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a very stressful situation, and the difficulty breathing is worse when you're being pushed to work faster. It’s concerning that it's affecting your breathing like that, and I appreciate you telling me about it. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your blood pressure, and ask you to do a few simple movements. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh… I don’t like doctor things. I always get… nervous. And they poke and prod. Not nice. But… husband say I should listen to you. He say you can help. I… I guess so. But… be gentle, okay? And… quick. I have to go back to work soon. Foreman… he doesn't like when we’re late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Airam. I understand your nervousness, and I promise to be as gentle and quick as I can. We’ll just do a few basic things, and I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It doesn't hurt at all, I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay… fine. But… don't touch my hair. I just… fixed it. And… hurry. The metal… it’s waiting. And the foreman… he’s not a patient man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I won’t touch your hair. I promise. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. And another deep breath… and out… Your breathing sounds a little… tight. I hear some mild wheezing, especially on your left side. And your heart rate is a little elevated, which could be from stress or exertion. Now, could you take a deep breath and cough, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Hack… hack… See? Not much. Just… a little tickle. I cough all the time. Like I said. It's… normal. Everyone coughs. And my chest… it feels… tight. Like a band. Not very comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I can see that your fingers are a little stiff. Do you experience any pain in your fingers when you grip things?
PATIENT: Yes. Always. Especially in the morning. Hard to… make a fist. And when I cut the metal… it hurts. Sharp pain. Like… needles. I just… ignore it. Gotta work. Can’t stop. Husband… he needs money. And the foreman… he doesn’t care about pain. He just wants the metal cut. Faster, faster, faster.
DOCTOR: Okay. And if I gently press here on your lower back… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ow. Yes. That… hurts. Always hurts. Especially after a long day. Like… someone punched me. Not a hard punch, but… annoying. And… stiff. Can’t bend over easily. Gotta… be careful. Don't want to… fall. Foreman… he yell if you fall. Says it’s… clumsy. And… unsafe.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some work-related musculoskeletal issues – likely strain in your lower back and some inflammation in your fingers – as well as some potential respiratory irritation from the dust exposure. The wheezing I heard suggests some possible early signs of asthma or bronchitis, which could be aggravated by the dust. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests. The X-ray will help us see if there’s any inflammation in your lungs, and the blood tests can rule out any underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood tests? Oh… I don't like needles. And… X-ray… is that… safe? I heard things. About… radiation. And… it takes time, right? Gotta go back to work. Foreman… he won't be happy. Maybe… we can just take some pills? Pink pills? Husband has lots of pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. It’s perfectly normal to be worried about needles and radiation. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low – it’s about the same amount you’d receive from a few days of natural background radiation. It's considered very safe, and the benefits of knowing what’s going on in your lungs far outweigh the risks. As for the blood tests, we only need a small sample, and I can make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. While pink pills might help with the pain temporarily, they won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. We need to find out what’s going on with your lungs and back to make sure we’re treating you properly. If we can get these tests done, I can give you a better idea of what’s going on and recommend a treatment plan that will actually help you. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: … Fine. But… quick. And… gentle. And… can you tell the foreman? I have to be… away? For a little while? He doesn’t understand… doctor things. He just wants the metal. Cut, bend, done. He doesn’t care about… pain. Or coughing. Or… anything.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. I'll do my best to make everything as quick and gentle as possible. And I can certainly write you a note to explain to your foreman that you're here for a medical assessment, and how long you'll likely be away. We can even include a statement about the importance of addressing work-related health concerns. Let me just get the lab orders and schedule the X-ray for you. It'll likely take about an hour or so for everything to be completed. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: … No. Just… hurry. And… make the foreman happy. He’s… a difficult man. And… I need my job. Husband… he depends on it. And… the metal is waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll do everything I can to expedite the process. Here are the requisitions for the lab tests and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician will be expecting you. I’m also printing a note for your foreman explaining your absence for medical assessment. Please let the receptionist know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and will contact you to discuss them. Thank you for coming in today, Airam. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
