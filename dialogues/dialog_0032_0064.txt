DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 62 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, sixty-two. It’s… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest pain is certainly something we need to investigate. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s… like a squeezing. Not a sharp pain, more… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It’s mostly here, <points to the center of her chest> right in the middle. And sometimes, it goes up to my shoulder, this one. <points to her left shoulder> Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. And when you say “sometimes,” how often would you say this pain occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, not every day. Maybe… three or four times in the last week? It usually happens when I’m… doing something. Like walking up the stairs, or carrying groceries. Not when I'm resting. It goes away if I stop, usually pretty quick. Maybe five minutes? Sometimes a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s exertion-related and relieved with rest. That’s helpful information. Does anything else seem to bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… <frowns, tapping a finger to her chin> Cold weather maybe? I noticed it was worse yesterday when it was a little chilly. And… sometimes, if I get really upset, it feels a little tighter. Not always, but… yeah. Being stressed, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Exertion, cold weather, and stress seem to be contributing factors. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. <pauses, thinking> Sometimes I get a little… breathless. Not like I can’t breathe, but… short of breath, maybe. And… my left arm feels a little… tingly sometimes when the chest hurts. Not numb, just… tingly. Oh! And I feel a little nauseous sometimes too, but I don't always throw up. Just feel sick to my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathlessness, tingling in the left arm, and nausea. Those are all important details. Now, let's go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill for it, I take it every morning. And… my mother had diabetes, so they check my sugar sometimes. It’s usually okay, but not always perfect. And… I had a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s not really important, is it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Chelberg. Everything is relevant. So, you’re on medication for hypertension, and you have a family history of diabetes and experience some blood sugar fluctuations. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… <rummages in her purse, pulls out a pill bottle> Here it is! Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril, one pill every morning. And… I think my knees are acting up a little more lately. The weather, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril. Good. And you mentioned your mother had diabetes. Do you know if she had any other medical problems, like heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. She had a heart attack, a long time ago. She was in the hospital for a long time. And… she had problems with her feet too. Something about the sugar, I think. They had to… take care of her feet a lot. It was very sad. <she looks down for a moment> She was a good woman.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… <pauses, tapping her chin> I had my gallbladder out, maybe twenty years ago? It was a long time ago, no problems with that. And… I was in the hospital when I had my baby, of course! That was a long time ago too. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy and delivery. And you take Lisinopril for hypertension. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I eat shellfish, I have a little bit of dust allergies sometimes but that is all. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything serious, thankfully. <she smiles weakly> I try to avoid things that bother me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother didn’t smoke, and I never liked it. It smells terrible! My husband, he used to smoke a little, but he quit years ago. He has a bad cough now, but not from the smoking, the doctor says. It's just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. A little bit of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Not very much. Just a glass or two. It helps me relax. Not every day, only when I'm feeling stressed. My husband likes a beer sometimes too, but not too much. We are not big drinkers.
DOCTOR: Okay. Light alcohol consumption. And finally, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not really. I walk a little, to the store and back. I used to dance, when I was younger, but my knees don’t allow for much dancing now. I mostly sit, to be honest. I like to watch television and read. It’s not much exercise, I know. But I try to stay active, you know? In my mind. <she chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Alright. So, light activity, mostly walking. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Ms. Chelberg. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. <She adjusts her position in the chair, looking a little nervous but willing.>
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths, in and out. <I listen to her heart and lungs for a minute, noting any abnormal sounds.> Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the anxiety. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. <I take her blood pressure and pulse. 150/90, pulse 88.> Your blood pressure is a little high today. It's good we checked that. Now, I’m going to palpate your chest to check for any tenderness. <I gently press on different areas of her chest, asking if she feels any pain.> Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. <winces slightly> Right here. <points to the center of her chest, the same area where she described the pain earlier> When you push on it, it feels… heavy. Like the squeezing again, but not as bad. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. The rest feels okay. <she takes a deep breath> It’s probably just my imagination. I get worried easily, you know?
DOCTOR: No, it's not your imagination, Ms. Chelberg. Tenderness to palpation in the center of the chest is a relevant finding. Now, I'm going to check your extremities for edema and assess your pulses. <I check her pulses in her wrists and ankles, and look for any swelling in her legs and feet.> Your pulses are good and I don't see any edema. Finally, I'm going to listen to your heart sounds again, and this time I’ll focus on any murmurs or extra sounds. <I listen carefully to her heart sounds for a minute.> I am hearing a soft murmur, and some mild crackles in the lower left lung field. These findings, combined with your symptoms and history, are concerning. Now, I would like to order an EKG and some blood work, including a cardiac enzyme panel, to rule out any acute cardiac event. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A murmur? Crackles? That sounds… serious. Cardiac event? Is that like a heart attack? <She looks increasingly worried, clutching her purse tightly.> Is it bad? I feel a little dizzy now. Yes, yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If it will help me… please. I just want to know what’s wrong. EKG and blood work… yes, please. Whatever you need. Just tell me what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg, try to remain calm. It's good we're investigating this. A murmur can be many things, some harmless, but we need to investigate. The crackles are also something we need to look into. A "cardiac event" can include a heart attack, but it's also a broad term. The tests will help us determine what's going on. I’ll order the EKG and blood work right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood and get you set up for the EKG. In the meantime, I'm going to order an oxygen saturation check and place you on continuous cardiac monitoring just to be safe. <I make notes on her chart and speak to the nurse.> It's better to be cautious. We're going to take good care of you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Continuous monitoring? That sounds… scary. But… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. <She takes a deep breath, trying to appear calmer than she feels.> Will the blood work take long? And… will the EKG hurt? I’ve never had one before. And… what if it is something bad? <Her voice trembles slightly.> I have my husband… he’ll be worried sick.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be worried, Ms. Chelberg. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. The blood work shouldn’t take too long; usually just a few minutes. As for the EKG, it’s completely painless. Small stickers will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. As for what if it is something serious, we will address it. The tests will give us a clearer picture, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. If it’s a heart issue, we have excellent cardiologists on staff who can provide the necessary care. We’ll keep your husband informed every step of the way. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. The nurse should be in shortly. Do you need anything while you wait?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay. Just… a little scared. <She looks down at her hands, wringing them nervously.> Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I appreciate you explaining everything. I just… I want to go home. But… I know we need to do this. <She sighs softly.> Just… let me know when the nurse is coming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chelberg. It’s perfectly understandable that you want to go home, and we’ll do everything we can to get you answers so that can be possible. I’ll step out and let the nurse know to come in as soon as possible. Please try to relax. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available.
