DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of fluid comes out, you see. It has been happening for… maybe three days now? Not much, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking fluid from the ear for about three days. That definitely needs checking out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… clear. Not blood, not… pus. Just clear liquid. And… it does not hurt, exactly. More… a fullness. Like when you go up high in a plane, yes? Like that feeling. Mostly when I lie down on that side. The left ear, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear fluid, no pain, just a feeling of fullness, like pressure, especially when lying on your left side. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ear with this, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Yes, good question. Now that you mention… yes. A little bit. Not much, but sounds are… quieter. Like someone turned down the volume a small amount. And… sometimes, a very quiet ringing. Like a… high-pitched tone, but very faint. It comes and goes, you understand? It is not constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild hearing loss and intermittent ringing in the left ear along with the fullness and discharge. Have you had any fever, chills, or any recent cold or upper respiratory infection?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. I have not felt sick. No cough, no… stuffy nose. Nothing like a cold. I have been… feeling normal, otherwise. Just this ear. It is… bothersome, but I have felt well enough to do my work. I teach, you see. At the college.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no systemic symptoms like fever or a cold. You’re a teacher at the college, that's good to know. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young boy, very young, maybe… six years old? I had many earaches. The doctor… he put something in my ears. Small tubes, I think. To drain the fluid. But I have not had any problems since then. Not until now, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of ear tubes as a child. That's good information. Do you recall if you ever had any problems with your balance or dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Balance… let me think. No. Not really. Sometimes, when I stand up quickly, I feel a little… lightheaded. But that is all. Nothing… spinning. Nothing that would make me fall. I am always careful when I get up.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional lightheadedness when standing up quickly, but no true dizziness. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. I take one medication. For my… blood pressure. A small pill, every morning. Lisinopril, I think it is called. And… sometimes, I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor told me my levels were low. Other than that… no. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Vitamin D. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I can eat anything. I have never had a reaction to any medicine. My wife… she had allergies to pollen, but I do not. I am very lucky, in that respect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright Gerhard, let’s take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal and eardrum. It doesn’t hurt, but it can be a little chilly.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. I am ready when you are. Please, proceed. I will try to stay very still. It is good you tell me it might be chilly. That is helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerhard. I can see some redness inside your left ear canal and a little bit of fluid behind the eardrum. Your right ear looks perfectly normal. I don’t see any signs of infection at this point, but the fluid is concerning. It looks like you might have a small amount of fluid in the middle ear space. This could be due to a number of things. It’s possible it’s a build-up of fluid from a mild blockage in the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of your throat. Or, it could be something else. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick hearing test. It’s a simple test where you just listen for tones in headphones and tell me when you hear them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. I understand. A hearing test. I can do that. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. A blockage in the… Eustachian tube? Is that serious? Will this affect my teaching? I need to be able to hear my students, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s good you ask. A blockage in the Eustachian tube isn’t usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your hearing temporarily. It shouldn’t affect your teaching long-term, but we need to find out what’s causing it. The hearing test will help us determine the extent of the hearing loss and rule out other possibilities. We'll go into the sound booth. It is a small room, soundproofed. I'll explain everything, and it will only take a few minutes. It won't be painful or uncomfortable, I promise. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained it very clearly. A soundproofed room, a few minutes. I understand. Let us proceed, then. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Gerhard, we have the results from the hearing test. It shows a mild conductive hearing loss in your left ear. This means the sound isn’t traveling through the ear canal and middle ear properly. The test doesn’t tell us why – it just confirms the hearing loss. Given your symptoms and the test results, I suspect it’s likely due to fluid in the middle ear, possibly from a Eustachian tube blockage. However, to be on the safe side, I'd like to monitor this closely. I’m going to prescribe a nasal decongestant to help open up your Eustachian tubes. I also recommend avoiding nasal congestion as much as possible – stay hydrated, avoid irritants, and consider a humidifier. We’ll see you back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment to repeat the hearing test and check your ear again. If your symptoms worsen—if you develop fever, severe pain, dizziness, or significant hearing loss—please call us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Nasal decongestant, avoid congestion, follow-up in two weeks. I can do that. And if it gets worse, I call. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very thorough. I appreciate your care. This has put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out your prescription and give you some written instructions about the medication and follow-up appointment. We’ll get you scheduled for that follow-up right now. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered everything. I am most grateful for your time and attention. I do not have any further questions at this time. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. Get well soon, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day!
