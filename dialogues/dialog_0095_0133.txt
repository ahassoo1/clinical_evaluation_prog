DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Just some health forms I need verified for… well, it doesn't really matter. Just need a notary, I guess. I hope this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Right. Forms… Okay. While I can certainly review them, and notarize if appropriate, my primary role here is to provide medical care. Are you experiencing any health issues at all that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no health issues, Doctor. Nothing like that. I just… need the forms signed. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you. I just don’t want to bother you with a whole examination if it’s not needed. Is that alright? I just want to get this over with, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to keep this brief. However, even for form verification, I am ethically obligated to ask a few basic questions to ensure I'm not inadvertently signing something that could be inaccurate or misleading. It protects both of us, really. It’ll just be a quick run-through. Do you mind if I ask a few things about your general health history?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose that’s fair. I mean, I don’t want you getting in trouble either. Just… try to make it quick, please? I have a lot on my plate today. What kind of questions are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Alright, quick is what we’ll aim for. Let’s start with this: Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not really, no. Not that I’ve ever noticed, anyway. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe a little sensitive to dust sometimes, but that's it. Nothing a good cleaning can’t fix. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? I haven’t taken a pill in… oh, goodness, probably decades. Just a little chamomile tea sometimes to help me sleep. But that's it. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I recall, really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… oh! I did break my arm once when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. No surgeries, though. Definitely no surgeries. Is this taking much longer? I really…
DOCTOR: Just a few more, Melvenia, and we'll be done with this part. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tough one. My mother lived to be 95, very healthy woman. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, I think. And my aunt, on my sister’s side, had… I think it was cancer, yes. But everyone in my family is pretty tough, you know? They all lived long lives. Does that help? Honestly, I can’t remember all the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Current health? Well, like I said, I’m perfectly fine! I get a little tired sometimes, being my age, but who doesn’t? I walk every day, I eat well, I sleep okay… I’m as healthy as can be expected. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just trying to get these papers signed so I can move on with my day. I don't understand why you need to ask me all these questions if I'm just having forms verified. It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Melvenia. And I apologize if this feels like a waste of your time. It's just that, even with forms, I have a responsibility to ensure I’m not unintentionally supporting something inaccurate. You mentioned getting a little tired. Is that a new fatigue, or something you've always experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, it's...it's been happening a little more lately, I suppose. But it's nothing serious. I just get older, you know? Things slow down. I have less energy. It's just part of getting old. I really don’t think it's anything to worry about. Can we please just get to the signing now? I have an appointment I need to get to. Honestly, this is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to ask one more question, then we can proceed with the forms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t want to talk about my weight. It’s a sensitive subject. And my appetite… well, it comes and goes. Sometimes I eat like a bird, sometimes I eat a little more. It depends on the day. It's just… old age, I tell you. Everything slows down. Can we please just get this over with? I feel like you're trying to find something wrong with me when there isn’t anything wrong. I just need these papers signed. .
DOCTOR: Melvenia, I understand your frustration, and I truly apologize if I'm causing you anxiety. However, based on what you've told me – the recent increase in fatigue and the changes in appetite – I am concerned. While it could be perfectly benign, these are symptoms that warrant further investigation. I am not comfortable signing these forms without a basic physical exam and some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s my ethical responsibility, and frankly, it's for your own well-being. I can perform a quick exam right here, and order the blood work. It will take a little longer, but it’s the responsible thing to do. If everything is normal, I’ll gladly sign the forms. But I cannot, in good conscience, do so without first ruling out any potential health concerns. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
