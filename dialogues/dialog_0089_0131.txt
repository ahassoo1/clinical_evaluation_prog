DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Roseburroough, nice to meet you too. Well, the reason I’m here is my blood pressure’s been a little high lately. It’s been bothering me, so I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re getting it checked. High blood pressure is something we want to address. “A little high” can mean different things to different people. Can you tell me roughly what numbers you’ve been seeing, or where you saw them measured?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I checked it at the pharmacy last week, and it was…140 over 90, I think? And then the machine at my friend’s place showed something similar a couple days ago. I don't usually pay that much attention to numbers, to be honest. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, 140/90 is a bit elevated, yes. That puts you at Stage 1 hypertension, according to current guidelines. It's good you're aware of it. Don't worry, we can definitely work through this. I see you've had Medicare for a few years, and it looks like this is your first visit with me at the clinic. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? Nothing the pharmacy couldn’t handle. No serious stuff, I promise. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to. Is it a problem that I haven't been to a doctor regularly?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It’s not a problem that you haven't been in regularly, but it does mean we need to get a good baseline established now. We'll want to do a full checkup, just to be sure everything else is okay. Alright, so no known allergies or medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. And I don’t take any medication at all. Not even vitamins, unless you count the gummy ones my friend keeps trying to get me to take! But I always forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No medications or allergies to worry about. And you said no significant past medical or surgical history?
PATIENT: That’s right. Nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, knock on wood. Just this blood pressure thing now. It’s kinda worrying me, though, because my mother had high blood pressure too. It was…pretty bad towards the end, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that family history is important to know, thank you. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. So, her high blood pressure caused her problems?
PATIENT: Yeah, it did. She ended up having a stroke, actually. That’s why I’m a little anxious about this, to be honest. I don't want that to happen to me. She didn't really take care of herself, though, if I’m being real. I try to eat okay, and I walk sometimes… but I could probably do better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with the family history. It's good you're being proactive now. We can absolutely work on managing your blood pressure to minimize that risk. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. Roseburroough. I just want to feel better and not end up like my mother, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 142/88 today, heart rate is 78 and regular, and your respiration is 16 and unlabored. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No edema in the extremities. Overall, you appear in good general health. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling at all. My feet feel fine. Everything feels…normal, except for maybe feeling a little tired sometimes. But I think that’s just because I work a lot. I'm a personal care aide, so I’m on my feet all day. Do you think that could be affecting my blood pressure?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point. Being on your feet all day can definitely contribute to higher blood pressure, especially with the physical exertion. It’s something we’ll consider. Given your blood pressure readings, family history, and occupation, I’m thinking we should run some basic blood work and a urine test. It will help us rule out any underlying causes of your high blood pressure and check your kidney function. We also might want to consider a simple EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…thorough. If it'll help figure things out, then yeah, I’m comfortable with that. I trust you. Just let me know what I need to do. Do I need to fast for the blood work? And will it take long? I have a client tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Yes, you will need to fast for the blood work – that means no food or drinks except water for 8-12 hours beforehand. It usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour for the blood draw and the EKG. The urine test can be done anytime. We can schedule it for first thing in the morning, and you should be able to make your client appointment. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications. Things like reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium-rich foods, regular exercise, and managing stress can all help lower your blood pressure. I can give you some resources with more information. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yeah, that would be really helpful. I know I should be eating better, and I definitely need to move around more. Stress too, for sure! My job can be…challenging sometimes. Any tips on where to start with all of that? It feels kinda overwhelming when I think about changing everything at once.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is overwhelming to think about changing everything at once. Let's start small. For diet, focus on reducing processed foods, fast food, and added salt. Aim for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. For exercise, even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. As for stress, have you tried any relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation?
PATIENT: Deep breathing… I think I’ve heard of that. Meditation… not really my thing, honestly. I get too antsy. I mostly just try to distract myself, like watching TV or talking to my friend. But I guess I could try the deep breathing thing. Is there a good way to do it? I don't want to do it wrong and make myself feel even worse! And where can I find good information about these potassium-rich foods you mentioned?
DOCTOR: Okay, distraction can be helpful sometimes, but deep breathing is a good tool to have. It’s pretty simple. You just sit comfortably, close your eyes if you like, and take slow, deep breaths, focusing on filling your belly with air. Inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, and exhale slowly for six seconds. Repeat that several times. There are lots of guided deep breathing exercises online if you'd like to try one. Here’s a website with some information about potassium-rich foods and some tips on managing hypertension. It also has a section about deep breathing exercises. We can also talk about other options, like yoga or tai chi, if those appeal to you. For now, let’s focus on those lifestyle changes and get the results of your tests back. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. That’s a lot of information, but I feel a little bit better just knowing what’s going on. Thank you, Dr. Roseburroough. You’ve been really helpful. I'll try to do what you said and take it one step at a time. And I’ll make sure to fast before the tests tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. That’s great to hear. Remember, it is a journey, and it's okay to start small. I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll review the results together when they come back and create a plan that works best for you. Take care, and I'll see you tomorrow.
