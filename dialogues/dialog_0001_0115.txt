DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Durig, have a seat. Look, I’m a busy man, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, it’s… it’s my skin, dear. It’s gotten rather yellow, hasn’t it? It’s… worrying. I believe the young man at the pharmacy mentioned something about my liver… something about hepatitis? I don't recall the details, truthfully. I just know I feel… tired, and everything seems a bit… off.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Or, at least, that’s what he said. It was… some time ago now. I don’t have a very good memory these days, you see. It’s… frustrating. Is that important? The hepatitis, I mean.
DOCTOR: Important?
PATIENT: Well, naturally it is! I just… I don’t recall how I got it, or when. It was a long time ago, I assure you. Before… well, before a great many things. I’m not sure what you’d like to know. Is there a questionnaire, perhaps? It might help me… recollect.
DOCTOR: Questionnaires are for people with time. Look, Mrs. Durig, let's just try to focus. Tiredness and yellow skin… have you noticed any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… not precisely pain, no. More… discomfort. A heaviness, perhaps, under my ribs, on the right side. It comes and goes. It’s… difficult to describe. And I’ve lost my appetite, I’m afraid. Everything tastes rather… bland these days.
DOCTOR: Right side discomfort, loss of appetite. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, a little of both, actually. Not frequently, you understand. Just… occasionally. Especially after I eat something… rich. It doesn't happen every time, but when it does, it's… unpleasant. And it leaves me feeling even more drained than usual. I apologize for being so vague; I'm doing my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. Lie back on the exam table. I need to feel your abdomen. Try to relax, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I shall try my best. It's… not always easy, you see. Old bones and all that. Do let me know if I'm making it difficult.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness here, a bit of guarding. Your liver feels… enlarged. And slightly firm. Any history of alcohol use, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Enlarged? That doesn’t sound… good. Alcohol… well, a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing excessive, I assure you. My husband… he enjoyed a good scotch, but I myself… not a great deal. Certainly nothing that would cause… this.
DOCTOR: "Occasionally" can mean a lot of things. And even moderate drinking can affect the liver over time. Any family history of liver problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. My family… they were from the mountains, you see. It was a long time ago, and we didn't… discuss such things openly. I recall my aunt… she was often unwell, but I don't know what afflicted her. They said it was “weakness of the blood”, perhaps? I truly don't know if it was… related. It was a different time, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, look. We need to get some blood work done. Liver function tests, a complete blood count, that sort of thing. It'll give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I’ll order those now. You’ll need to go to the lab down the street. Do you have trouble getting there?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, blood work. Of course. That sounds… sensible. Getting there… well, I do take the bus. It’s… a bit of a walk from the stop to the lab, and I tire easily, you see. I usually ask a kind young man to assist me with my bag. Will the results be sent to you directly? I do hope it won’t be too long; I dislike waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, they’ll be sent here. It usually takes a few days. And frankly, Mrs. Durig, if things don’t look good, we’re going to have to discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist. You may need further testing, possibly even a liver biopsy. Here's the lab order. I suggest you go as soon as possible. Any other complaints while you're here?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A gastroenterologist? And a… biopsy? That sounds… frightening. I… I suppose not, at the moment. Just the tiredness, and the skin… and the occasional discomfort. Oh! Wait. My feet. They’ve been… swollen, lately. Especially in the evenings. I thought it was just the heat, but… perhaps it’s related?
DOCTOR: Swollen feet, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. They are usually fine in the morning, but by the end of the day… they are rather puffy. It makes walking even more difficult, you see. And I have noticed… a bit of itching, all over. It's not constant, but it's… irritating. It’s all rather unsettling, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Durig, you're giving me a whole laundry list of symptoms now. This is why I need a clear picture. The swelling and itching… could be a number of things. We’ll see what the blood work shows. Honestly, I'm not going to speculate without actual data. Okay, go to the lab, get the blood work done, and we’ll talk again when I have the results. Next!
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I… I understand. Data, of course. I shall go to the lab as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. .
