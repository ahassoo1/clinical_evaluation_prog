DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my foot, see? It's been swelling up. Not all of a sudden, but over the last… oh, maybe a week or so, it’s gotten worse. Mostly just this one, the left one. It kinda aches, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your left foot has been swelling and aching for about a week, and it’s gradually worsening. Could you tell me a bit more about the ache?
PATIENT: It’s not a sharp pain, you know? More of a… dull throb. It's there most of the time, but it gets worse if I’m on it a lot. Like, if I've been walking around doing things. When I sit down and put my feet up, it calms down a bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull throb that worsens with activity and improves with rest. That’s helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your foot besides the swelling and ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No real color change, not that I’ve noticed. And it doesn’t feel hot to the touch, if that's what you mean. Skin feels normal. Oh! Now that I think about it, my sock feels a little tighter around it than usual this morning. Maybe the swelling went up overnight a little bit? I didn't pay much attention to it when I put my shoes on.
DOCTOR: Okay, no color change, no feeling of heat, and potentially some increased swelling overnight. Good observations, thank you. And have you experienced any injuries to your foot recently – a twist, a bump, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven’t twisted it or anything. I mostly just walk around, you know? I don't do much heavy lifting or sports or anything. I was helping my neighbor carry some groceries a few days ago, but it wasn’t anything too heavy. Just a couple of bags. Didn’t bother me at the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent injury, and the grocery bags don't seem likely to have caused this. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything, honestly. I try to eat pretty healthy. I don’t go to the doctor much, if I can help it. Just when something really bothers me. And this foot is starting to bother me. I don't have insurance, so… I try to wait it out as long as I can. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Parascandola. I understand your concern about not having insurance. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just water, mostly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? It wasn’t bothering me anymore, so he said I didn’t need it. I haven't taken anything since. Just trying to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, you know? No problems. My wife used to try and get me to eat spicy peppers, and I was fine! She's gone now, but she always liked to test me. No allergies though, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Parascandola. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I hope you can figure out what's going on with it. It’s just getting more annoying, you know? Makes it hard to get around.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a look. I'm noting some mild swelling on the top and inside of your foot. The skin looks normal in color, as you mentioned, and there are no obvious signs of injury or open wounds. I’m going to gently palpate, or feel around, your foot now to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that spot right there, on the inside, kinda hurts when you press on it. Not a sharp pain, but… yeah, that's definitely tender. And a little bit here, on the bone, but not as bad as that first spot. It's kinda… a dull ache, when you press on it. But yeah, that inside part is the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the inside of your foot, specifically along the navicular bone, and some mild tenderness along the bone itself. I'm also going to check your range of motion. Could you gently point your toes up and down, and then move your foot inward and outward?
PATIENT: Okay, let me try. It feels a little stiff, you know? Not bad, but… not as easy as it used to be. It kinda creaks a little bit when I move it that way. And it feels a little uncomfortable, kinda like a dull ache, when I push it too far. But I can do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, some stiffness and discomfort with range of motion. Finally, I’m going to check the pulses in your foot to make sure the circulation is good. Your pulses feel normal, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a navicular bone stress reaction, possibly exacerbated by some mild arthritis. It's not a fracture, thankfully, but it's important to address it before it gets worse. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Navicular… stress reaction? Arthritis? Hmm… not really, no. I’m not a doctor, you know? What does that mean? Is it serious? Will I need… surgery? I don't want surgery. And what do I need to do about it? I need to be able to walk around.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for clarification, and I apologize for using terms that weren't clear. Let me explain it in simpler terms. Your navicular bone is a small bone on the inside of your foot, and a stress reaction means it’s become irritated or inflamed, likely from repetitive stress – in your case, walking. It's like a small bruise on the bone. The mild arthritis could be contributing to the irritation, causing some stiffness and discomfort. It's not an emergency, and it's unlikely you’ll need surgery. The goal is to reduce the stress on the bone so it can heal. We can start with conservative treatment, which means things other than surgery. I recommend the following: first, rest. Try to avoid activities that aggravate the pain. Second, ice. Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day. Third, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce pain and inflammation. And finally, supportive footwear. Wearing shoes with good arch support can help distribute the weight more evenly. I’d also like you to try a walking boot for 6 weeks to offload the stress on the navicular bone. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A walking boot? For six weeks? That sounds… a long time. What about work? I gotta walk around at work. And I don't have much money for a boot. How much does one cost? And… will the pain go away if I just rest it for a bit? Maybe it will just get better on its own. I don’t want to spend money on a boot if I don’t need to. And what if it doesn't get better? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Parascandola. Let’s address them one by one. A walking boot for six weeks does seem like a long time, and I understand your worry about work. We can discuss options for modifying your work activities to minimize stress on your foot while wearing the boot, perhaps reducing your walking distance or switching tasks temporarily. Regarding the cost, walking boots can range from around $80 to $200, depending on the features and brand. We can check with local charities or medical supply stores to see if they have any loaner boots available or offer financial assistance. As for whether it will heal on its own, it might improve with rest alone, but it's less likely to heal completely and could potentially worsen over time if you continue to put stress on it. The boot helps to immobilize the foot and allow the bone to heal properly. If it doesn't improve after six weeks in the boot, or if the pain worsens, we may need to consider further imaging, such as an MRI, to rule out a stress fracture or other underlying issues. We can also explore referral to a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist, for further evaluation and treatment options. Would you like me to write a note for your employer explaining your condition and the need for modified duties?
PATIENT: Yeah, a note for my employer would be good. That would help. And checking on a loaner boot… that would be great too. I really don’t want to spend a lot of money on this. I just want to be able to walk without it hurting, you know? And… what about the pain relievers? Are there any side effects? I don’t take a lot of medicine, so I'm a little worried about that. And is there anything else I can do besides rest and ice? Any exercises or stretches? I don't want to just sit around doing nothing for six weeks.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Parascandola. I understand your concerns, and we can definitely explore all your options. Regarding the pain relievers, ibuprofen and naproxen are generally safe when taken as directed, but they can have side effects, such as stomach upset, heartburn, or increased risk of bleeding. It’s important to take them with food to minimize stomach irritation, and avoid taking them if you have any kidney problems or are taking blood thinners. We can discuss alternative pain management options if you’re concerned about the side effects. As for exercises and stretches, it’s best to avoid any weight-bearing activities that aggravate the pain during the initial healing phase. Once the pain starts to subside, we can gradually introduce some gentle range-of-motion exercises and stretches to help improve flexibility and strength. I can provide you with a handout outlining some safe exercises to perform once you’re ready. I'll write a note for your employer, and I’ll have my nurse check on local resources for loaner boots. Here’s a handout with information about safe exercises to perform once the pain subsides. I’ll also give you a prescription for ibuprofen, but feel free to start with over-the-counter options if you prefer. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to assess your progress. If you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained things really well, and I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on and what I need to do. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I'm glad I could help. Remember to rest, ice, and follow the instructions we discussed. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
