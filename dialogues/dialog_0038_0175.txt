DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been pretty painful lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. I see. Could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain exactly. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? It's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it shoots down my leg a little bit. It’s worse when I bend over or try to lift something. Even sitting for too long isn’t great.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache in the lower back, radiating down the leg sometimes, worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. That gives me a bit of a picture. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It didn’t just suddenly start, you know? It’s been building up for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? I honestly can't remember the exact date. I just noticed it getting worse and worse, and figured I should probably get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually worsening over the past month or so. Have you done anything specific that you think might have triggered it – any heavy lifting, twisting movements, or a fall, perhaps?
PATIENT: You know, I’ve been doing a little gardening lately, helping my wife with her flowers. Lots of bending and kneeling, I guess. Nothing too heavy, but maybe that had something to do with it? I haven't fallen or anything like that, though. Just the gardening, really. And maybe just getting old, haha.
DOCTOR: Gardening can definitely put a strain on your back! It's good you're thinking about potential triggers. And getting older is part of life, no shame in that! Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever experienced, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Hmm… I’d say maybe a 5 or 6. It’s not crippling, but it’s definitely noticeable. It’s a constant ache, and if I move the wrong way, it’ll shoot up to a 7 or 8 for a few seconds. Then it settles back down a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 5 or 6 most of the time, with flares to 7 or 8 with certain movements. Do you notice anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Lying down helps a lot. Especially on my side with a pillow between my knees. And if I take it really easy, just resting, it seems to calm down a bit. Warm baths are good too. They don't get rid of it, but they take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down, especially on your side with a pillow between your knees, and warm baths provide some relief. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a little bit. Not all the time, but sometimes my left foot feels a little… numb, like it’s fallen asleep. And sometimes my left leg feels a little weak, like it's harder to lift it. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's there sometimes. I didn’t really think much of it before, honestly. Just figured it was old age again, haha.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent numbness in the left foot and some weakness in the left leg. That's important information. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Ask whatever you need to.
DOCTOR: Great. First, do you have any significant past medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. Other than that… not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart disease, no arthritis. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. My wife always tells me I'm too stubborn to get sick, haha.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! And sometimes stubbornness is a good thing. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm playing basketball in college. But other than that, no. No other surgeries or hospital stays. It’s been pretty quiet on that front, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a broken arm in college. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. My wife sometimes jokes that I should have more allergies, considering how much I eat, haha. But seriously, no. No known allergies to anything. I can take most medications without any problems.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the medication for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to be safe. Nothing else. My wife keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of supplements, but I'm not really a believer in all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a daily multivitamin. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had problems with back pain, arthritis, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Let me think... My mother had some bad arthritis in her hands when she got older. And my older brother had some back problems after he hurt himself lifting heavy things at work. He had to get some physical therapy for it, but he’s doing okay now. Other than that, not really. No one else in the family had any major back or nerve problems, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had arthritis and your brother had back problems from an injury. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m retired now, so I don’t have a regular job. I mostly spend my time gardening, doing a little bit of housework, and spending time with my wife. We like to go for walks when the weather is nice. I try to stay active, but I’m not exactly an athlete, haha. I used to smoke a long time ago, but I quit about 20 years ago. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, gardening, walking, quit smoking 20 years ago, occasional glass of wine. That’s helpful. Alright, Mr. Way, I see here you haven't been to a doctor in a few years. Last visit was for a check-up in 2022, blood pressure was well-controlled then. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I figured you’d want to take a look at it.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. I’m going to gently feel along your spine and check your range of motion. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness along your lower spine, right here. And when I ask you to bend forward, you experience some discomfort. Your range of motion is slightly limited. I'm also checking your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Everything seems normal there, but you do report some mild decreased sensation in your left foot when I touch it. No significant weakness noted. I’m going to check straight leg raise now. Okay, that causes some pain down your left leg, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that does. It’s the same pain I get sometimes, shooting down my leg. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely there. More on the outside of my leg, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain radiating down the outside of the left leg with the straight leg raise test. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a pinched nerve in your lower back – likely a lumbar radiculopathy, or sciatic nerve compression. The pain radiating down your leg, the numbness in your foot, and the positive straight leg raise test all point to that. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. And depending on the results, we might consider an MRI to get a more detailed look at the nerves and discs in your spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get it fixed. An X-ray sounds fine. I don’t know anything about MRIs, but if you think I need one, then I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll order the X-ray now. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity, and continue the warm baths. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help manage the pain. I’m also going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the muscle spasms in your back. It's called cyclobenzaprine. It can make you a little drowsy, so be careful driving or operating machinery while taking it. Does that all sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Muscle relaxant sounds helpful. And I’ll definitely be careful with driving. I don’t do much heavy lifting anyway, so that’s not a problem. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better knowing what’s going on. And knowing what to expect with the medication.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. I’ll also give you a handout with some exercises you can do to help strengthen your back muscles once the pain subsides. We'll review the X-ray results when they come back, and then we can discuss a more long-term treatment plan. If your pain worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs or loss of bowel or bladder control, please contact the office immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything really well, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and explanation. I feel a lot more at ease now. I’ll schedule the X-ray and follow your instructions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Get well soon!
