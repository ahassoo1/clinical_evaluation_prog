DOCTOR: Bonjour. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you, Wynell. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Panjoj, is it? Well, honestly, I don’t really feel like telling you everything. It’s just…people these days, always wanting to poke and prod. My daughter insisted I come. Said I needed to “get things checked.” Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Mostly. Just…old, I suppose. It's probably just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Wynell. It can be uncomfortable discussing these things, and being poked and prodded isn't anyone's favorite activity! Your daughter sounds very thoughtful, though, and sometimes a little check-up can give us peace of mind, even if everything feels okay. We’ll go at your pace, and I’ll only ask what’s necessary. Perhaps we can start with “mostly”?
PATIENT: “Mostly” what, dear? You’re being awfully vague. It’s just…my feet, I suppose. They ache sometimes. But everyone’s feet ache when they get to be my age, don’t they? It’s not like it’s a problem problem. I get by. I used to be a dancer, you know. A very good dancer. Before…well, before things changed. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: You were a dancer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! A very good one, I tell you. In Port-au-Prince, before… well, before everything. We did all sorts of things – traditional dances, some more modern styles. It was a lovely life. But that’s neither here nor there. I haven’t danced in… goodness, decades. And I certainly didn’t come here to reminisce about dancing. I came because my daughter, Claudette, is convinced I’m falling apart. Which is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It sounds like dancing was a very important part of your life, Wynell. That’s wonderful. It’s understandable that Claudette wants to make sure you’re well, especially given your active past. So, these aches in your feet… when do they bother you the most?
PATIENT: Oh, Claudette. She worries too much. Always has. And honestly, aches? It's not just aches, it's… a heaviness. They feel… thick. Mostly in the mornings, I suppose. Getting out of bed is the worst. And after I’ve been on my feet too long. Though I don’t do much standing anymore. A bit of cooking, a bit of… well, not much, really. It's just… annoying. And frankly, I’ve lived a long life. I’m 83 years old, you know. Things are bound to start… slowing down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to experience changes with age, and it sounds like this heaviness is particularly noticeable in the mornings and after activity. And you’re right, 83 years is a long and full life! Besides the heaviness in your feet, are you experiencing any other discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My knees creak, of course. My back isn't what it used to be. And… well, I get tired easily. But that’s just… getting old, dear. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I don’t need a list of everything that aches and groans. It comes with the territory. I just want to be left alone to enjoy my quiet life.
DOCTOR: I completely respect your desire for a quiet life, Wynell. And you're right, some aches and pains do come with age. I’m not trying to make a list of everything that bothers you, but just trying to get a complete picture, so we can understand what’s going on and ensure you can continue to enjoy your life. Let’s go back to the feet for a moment. Is this heaviness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly goes, if I'm honest. There are days I don't even think about my feet. And then, suddenly, bam! Like weights tied to them. It's not predictable. And it’s not… debilitating. I can still walk, can still get around. Slowly, perhaps. And with a bit of a grimace sometimes. But I manage. Honestly, I think you’re making too much of this.
DOCTOR: So, it’s intermittent – comes and goes without a clear pattern. And it doesn’t prevent you from walking, although it can be uncomfortable. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list. I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. And a hip replacement. A very unpleasant experience, that was. And… well, I've had the usual things. Pneumonia a few times. The flu. Nothing major. I'm a strong woman. I’ve always bounced back. Honestly, I don't see why you need to know all this. It's not related to my feet.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily about your feet specifically, Wynell, but understanding your medical history helps me get a complete picture of your overall health and ensure there aren’t any underlying factors contributing to your symptoms. It’s important to consider everything. You mentioned a hip replacement. Do you remember approximately when that was performed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that was… let me think. Claudette will know, she keeps all my records. Probably…oh, I don’t know… twenty years ago? Maybe more? It feels like a lifetime ago. It helped for a while, but it’s not what it used to be. Honestly, everything starts to wear out eventually. Like an old shoe.
DOCTOR: Approximately twenty years ago. That’s good to know. And you’re right, things can wear out over time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Claudette handles all that too. She's very organized. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… something for my arthritis, maybe? Honestly, I can’t keep track of it all. And allergies… I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Though my daughter always warns me about everything. She's very cautious.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. It sounds like you're on medication for blood pressure and possibly arthritis. We’ll definitely confirm the exact medications and dosages with Claudette. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your feet and legs, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a quick look and feel to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, I knew this was coming. Very well. But be gentle, dear. I bruise easily. And don’t expect miracles. These feet have seen a lot. And I warn you, they’re not pretty.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. And don't worry about "pretty," I'm simply looking for information. Let's start with you sitting comfortably. If you could just sit on the edge of the table and let me take a look, that would be great. First, I’ll just check your pulses. Okay, good pulses on both sides. Now, let's see… I notice a bit of swelling on both ankles, and some mild redness. And… Hmm… a little tenderness on the outside of both ankles. And the skin feels slightly thicker on the soles of your feet.
PATIENT: Honestly, you're making a fuss over nothing. A little swelling? Everyone gets a little swelling when they’re older. And tenderness? Well, of course, they’re tender. I’ve been walking on them for eighty-three years! What did you expect? And thicker skin? That’s just… calluses, I suppose. I used to dance, remember? We danced barefoot sometimes. Though Claudette would have a fit if she knew. She's always telling me to wear shoes.
DOCTOR: You're right, a little swelling and tenderness are common with age and a history of activity like dancing. And your dancing certainly explains the thicker skin on the soles of your feet. I'm simply documenting everything I observe, so we have a complete picture. Now, I’m going to gently move your ankles around to see how easily they bend. Okay, a bit of stiffness with dorsiflexion on both sides, but nothing too concerning.
PATIENT: Stiffness? Of course, there's stiffness! I haven’t been doing cartwheels lately, you know. I told you, everything slows down eventually. And honestly, I don't like being poked and prodded. It makes me nervous. Can we be done soon? I have a lovely view from my porch and I was hoping to enjoy a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Of course. We're almost finished. I completely understand your discomfort. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related changes in your feet, likely compounded by your active history as a dancer. The swelling, tenderness, and stiffness are all common findings. I see here from your records that you’ve had some blood work done recently. Your results are within normal limits, which is good. Based on everything, I suspect this is likely osteoarthritis, but to be certain, we could get some X-rays to take a closer look at the bones in your feet. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you call it? Honestly, I don't need a fancy name for aching feet. It’s just old age, dear. And X-rays? All that radiation? No, thank you. I've lived a long life without needing X-rays, and I'd like to keep it that way. Honestly, I think I'd rather just go home and soak my feet in warm water. Is that allowed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Soaking your feet in warm water is an excellent idea. It can provide a lot of relief. And you are absolutely right to be cautious about radiation exposure. We won’t proceed with the X-rays if you’re not comfortable with them. Based on your preference, we can manage this as likely age-related osteoarthritis without further imaging. I recommend warm foot soaks for 15-20 minutes a couple of times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can also help with the discomfort, if needed. And wearing comfortable, supportive shoes, as your daughter suggests, is always a good idea. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… that’s the white pill, isn’t it? I think I take that. Honestly, I'm not sure. Claudette handles all the pills. And comfortable shoes… yes, yes. She's always nagging me about shoes. I prefer sandals, but she says they don't provide enough support. Honestly, it’s all so much trouble. No, I don't think I have any questions. I just want to go home and soak my feet. And maybe have a cup of tea. Is it alright if I leave now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It sounds like you have a good plan – warm soaks, possibly acetaminophen, and comfortable shoes. And you certainly deserve a cup of tea after all this. I’ll document everything we discussed today in your record, including the recommendation for warm foot soaks, consideration of acetaminophen, and the importance of comfortable footwear. I’ll also make a note to verify your medication list with Claudette. You are welcome to leave whenever you're ready. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. And please, enjoy your cup of tea! It was a pleasure meeting you, Wynell.
