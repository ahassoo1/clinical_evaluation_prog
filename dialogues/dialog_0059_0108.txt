DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Chagaris, huh? Fancy name. Look, don’t bother with the pleasantries, Doc. I’ve been… bleeding. From down there. It’s not pretty, and frankly, it’s a waste of my time being here if you don't know what I’m talking about. Just get on with it, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I understand your concern and apologize if my initial greeting felt too lengthy. Bleeding, as you describe, is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about when this bleeding started?
PATIENT: When it started? Honestly, Doc, I don’t spend my days cataloging my… bodily functions. A few days ago, maybe? It wasn't a flood, just… noticeable. Enough to worry me, which says something, because I don’t get worried. It’s been happening on and off since then. Dark stuff. And, look, I'm a practical man. I don’t need a lecture on fiber. I need to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Gentz. “Dark stuff,” as you put it, is helpful information. On a scale of one to ten, with one being just a few drops and ten being soaking through your clothes, how would you rate the amount of bleeding?
PATIENT: Ten is ridiculous, Doc. Don’t insult my intelligence with these… scales. It's not that bad. Maybe a four, five on a good day. Definitely more than a little. Enough to stain my underwear, alright? And it’s tiring. Weakening, even. Look, I run a business. I don’t have time to be… leaking. It’s unprofessional. You understand? I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Gentz. It’s concerning that you’re experiencing weakness alongside the bleeding, and I appreciate you telling me about that. To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Look, I'm not a doctor. I just know something's not right. I've been… tired, obviously. And a little lightheaded sometimes. Nothing major. My stomach’s been a bit… unsettled. Not sick, exactly. Just… off. And I’ve been going to the bathroom more, I suppose. But who doesn’t go to the bathroom? It's probably nothing. This is all a waste of time. You probably just need to tell me I need to eat more prunes.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these changes, Mr. Gentz, and it’s helpful that you’re sharing them with me. The fatigue, lightheadedness, and stomach upset are all relevant. Could you describe the color of your stool?
PATIENT: The color of my… Honestly, Doc. You’re really pushing it now. It’s… dark. Like the blood. Blackish, maybe? Look, I’m a practical man. I deal with… things. I don’t spend my time analyzing my… waste products. Is this going somewhere, or are we just going to sit here and dissect my bowel movements all day? I have a business to run, you know. People are relying on me. This is… frankly, humiliating.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Gentz. I understand this is unpleasant and potentially embarrassing, and I assure you I am trying to gather the necessary information to understand what’s happening and get you the right care. The dark stool is concerning, and it helps to rule out certain possibilities. Have you experienced any pain or cramping in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, Doc. More like… discomfort. A dull ache, here and there. Comes and goes. Nothing that would stop me from working. I’ve had worse. Honestly, I'm tougher than most men your age. Look, I don't need coddling, I need answers. Is this something serious, or am I just wasting my time? I have a schedule to keep. This is… interfering with my life. You understand? Interfering.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Gentz. Given the bleeding, dark stools, fatigue, and discomfort, it’s important that we investigate this thoroughly. I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Are you serious? Look, Doc, I appreciate you trying to be thorough, but that’s… that’s completely unacceptable. I’m a businessman. I don’t just let people… poke around. No. Absolutely not. Is there anything else you can do? Blood tests? A scan? Anything but that. Frankly, this is becoming insulting. I came here for answers, not… an invasion of privacy. This is… ridiculous. I think I’m going to need to reconsider this whole visit. It’s a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Gentz, and I sincerely apologize if I’ve made you feel uncomfortable. A rectal exam is often the most effective way to assess the source of rectal bleeding, but I respect your wishes and would never proceed without your consent. We can certainly order blood tests to check your hemoglobin and other parameters. A scan, such as a CT scan, could also be considered, but it involves radiation exposure and may not always pinpoint the source of the bleeding. Given your symptoms and the dark stools, it could indicate bleeding higher up in the digestive tract which a scan might not show effectively. However, without a physical exam, it's challenging to make an accurate assessment. Would you be open to discussing why the exam is important so I can better explain the benefits and address your concerns?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I’m a practical man. I understand benefits. I understand risks. But I also understand boundaries. And this… this crosses a boundary. I’m not comfortable with it. Period. I appreciate you explaining things, but it’s not going to change my mind. Just run the blood tests. Whatever tests you think are necessary without… that. And then tell me what’s wrong. I have a business to run. People are relying on me. This is… interfering. Frankly, I’m starting to regret even coming here. It's a waste of my valuable time. Just… do the tests. No exam. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, that is perfectly clear. I respect your decision. We will proceed with the blood tests as requested, including a complete blood count, iron levels, and liver function tests. I will also order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding. While the blood tests and stool test will provide valuable information, it's important to understand that without a physical exam, a definitive diagnosis may be more difficult. If the results are concerning, I strongly recommend considering a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, which may include an endoscopy or colonoscopy. Would you be amenable to discussing that option if the results warrant it?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Is that where they… stick a camera down your throat? Look, Doc, you’re just piling on the invasive procedures now. No. Absolutely not. I came here for a simple answer, not a full-blown medical investigation. Just run the tests. Tell me what the results are. And then I’ll decide what, if anything, I want to do. I’m not comfortable with any more… poking and prodding. Frankly, this is becoming ridiculous. I’m a businessman. I don’t have time for this. People are relying on me. I think… I think I’m done discussing this. Just get the tests ordered. That's all. And then let me know when they're ready. I'm losing valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I will order the blood tests and stool test immediately. I will also provide you with a requisition form and instructions on where to go to have the tests done. I want to reiterate that the tests will provide us with valuable information, but without further investigation, it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your symptoms. I strongly encourage you to consider all your options, including a referral to a gastroenterologist, if the results raise any concerns. However, the decision is entirely yours. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get the tests done. And then let me know when they’re ready. I have a business to run. People are relying on me. This has been… a waste of my time, frankly. I think I’m done here. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I’ll have the requisitions printed for you now. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Have a good day.
