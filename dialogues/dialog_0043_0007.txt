DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 42 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It is…pleasant to meet you as well. I am here because I am having…pain. It is quite bothersome, and I would like it to stop if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It is…difficult to explain. It is not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a…dull ache. It is mostly in my back, lower part. And sometimes it goes down my leg. The left one, usually. It has been this way for…some time now. Several weeks, I believe.
DOCTOR: Several weeks, you say. And it’s a dull ache in your lower back, radiating down your left leg. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain – bending, lifting, twisting, or perhaps sitting for extended periods?
PATIENT: Yes, all of those things make it worse. Bending is…very difficult. Lifting even a small thing…I have to be careful. And sitting for too long…that is bad too. It feels…stiffer after I sit. It is…uncomfortable. Working doesn't help, naturally. It is a physical job.
DOCTOR: I see. A physical job and those activities exacerbating the pain… that’s helpful to know. When you say “physical job,” could you describe the typical tasks involved?
PATIENT: I erect fences. It involves…digging post holes, carrying posts, stretching wire…hammering. It is…a lot of bending and lifting. And walking in uneven ground. It is…demanding work. I have been doing it for…many years now. Since before…my husband passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is demanding work, and you’ve been doing it for a long time. I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Now, focusing on the pain, does it radiate anywhere else besides your leg?
PATIENT: No. Only the leg. Sometimes it feels…numb, the foot. But mostly just the ache in the back and down the leg. It is…worse in the mornings. When I get up. It takes a little while to…loosen up. It is…difficult to explain, really.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, you're explaining it perfectly. Worse in the mornings, takes a while to loosen up… and numbness in the foot. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, or any difficulty with controlling your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not…exactly. It feels…tired, sometimes. But I can still walk. And no, no trouble with…that. Everything works as it should, thankfully. I am…thankful for that. I have heard stories…and that would be…very difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s always good when things are functioning as they should. Now, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is…fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I would like to know what is causing this…pain. I am…tired of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll do our best to figure it out. If you'll just lie down on the table for me, please. I’m going to start by feeling along your spine and checking your range of motion. Okay, can you tell me if this is tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Yes. There…right there. It hurts when you press. And a little bit…to the side. It is…a dull ache, like always. But…more pronounced when you touch it. It is…uncomfortable, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And what about when I bend you forward, like you’re trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: It hurts…when I bend. A sharp pain shoots down my leg. Not all the way, but…down the back of it. It is…difficult to go very far. I can feel it…pulling. It is…uncomfortable. Please, be careful. I do not want to…make it worse.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll go as far as you are comfortable. No need to push through any pain. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? I am…not very flexible, Doctor. It has been…a long time since I stretched. This job…does not encourage that.
DOCTOR: Okay, and your reflexes are…normal on both sides. Good. Now, could you please try to stand on your tiptoes, and then on your heels?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? It is…difficult to balance. And… This is…very hard. I feel…unsteady. Perhaps I should sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s sit down. That’s perfectly alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve involvement – what we sometimes call sciatica. The pain radiating down your leg, the tenderness in your lower back, and difficulty with bending and lifting are all consistent with that. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes. If that is what you think is best, Doctor. I…trust your judgment. I just want to know what is causing this…pain. And how to…make it stop. Will it…take long?
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Ms. Reihner. Just a few minutes. The X-ray will help us see if there's any structural problem contributing to your pain, like a fracture or arthritis. And then, we can discuss some treatment options to help you feel better. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or bending, and we can talk about some over-the-counter pain relievers and gentle exercises you can try. Do you have any allergies to medications, specifically NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: No. I do not have any allergies. I can take…ibuprofen, if needed. My husband…used to give it to me for headaches. I have not taken it in…a long time, but I do not think I am allergic. Is that…enough for now? I would like to…go home soon.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Ibuprofen can be helpful for reducing inflammation and pain. Yes, for now, let’s start with that and rest. I'll send the order for the X-ray to the radiology department, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory, in case the over-the-counter ibuprofen isn't enough. This is naproxen. Take one tablet twice a day with food. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think…that is all. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You have been…very helpful. I appreciate your…patience. I hope…this medicine works. I just want to…feel better. And…get back to work. I suppose…I will wait for the call about the X-ray. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I understand wanting to get back to work, and we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve that. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your X-ray appointment. Here’s my card. And please, take it easy. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
