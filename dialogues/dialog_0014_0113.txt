DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Osterholm, was it? Yes. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Seems like all I do is go to the bathroom. It's a nuisance, really. More than it used to be, that’s for sure. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been… a while. My wife keeps telling me I'm always going, but she exaggerates. Women, you know? Always making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Right. More frequent urination. And you say it's been going on for a "while"... can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Specific… Let me see. It’s not like yesterday, all of a sudden. Definitely not. Months, I suppose. Maybe even… a year? Time just sort of blurs together when you get to be my age, you know? I used to be able to go a good… well, a good long time between trips. Now it's just… more often. And sometimes… sometimes I just have to go. A real urgency. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased frequency and urgency, lasting at least a year, possibly longer. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Burning… hmm. Maybe a little… a little discomfort, sometimes. But it's not like a sharp pain, if you know what I mean. It's just… a feeling. Like… like you haven't quite emptied everything out, if that makes sense. It's not constant, though. Just… sometimes. Mostly it’s just the going so often that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, some intermittent discomfort, feeling of incomplete emptying. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is it a strong, steady flow when you do go?
PATIENT: Difficulty… well, now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes it takes a moment. Just a moment, mind you. Not like a struggle or anything. It just… starts slow. And it's not as powerful as it used to be, I suppose. Used to be able to… well, never you mind about that. But it's not a strong stream anymore, no. Definitely not like when I was a young man. It’s… weakening, you could say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you notice any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Goodness, no! I haven’t seen any blood. My wife would have noticed that right away, believe me. She’s always checking things. No, no blood. I'm fairly certain. Though… well, sometimes it’s a little cloudy, maybe? But I figured that was just… you know, what happens when you get older. Don't think it was blood.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cloudy urine sometimes. Now, let's talk about other things. Do you have any problems with constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I don’t go every day, if that’s what you mean. But I don't feel blocked up or anything. It's just… slower, shall we say? I eat alright, mostly. My wife makes sure I get my fiber. She's very particular about that sort of thing. But no, no real problems. Not like some people I know.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not a daily bowel movement, but no significant constipation. Do you have any history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family had diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not me. Never been told I have diabetes. And my family… well, my parents lived to a good old age, and I don't recall any of them having that… that sugar sickness. My wife's side… now they had all sorts of problems. But I don't think diabetes was one of them. Lots of heart trouble, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. No personal or strong family history of diabetes. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... My wife gives me a little pill for my blood pressure. Small, white one. And sometimes I take something for my… well, for my joints. They ache, you know, when the weather changes. Something with glucosamine, I think. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Can’t forget the vitamins. Nothing else, though. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, glucosamine for your joints, and a multivitamin. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can we start with your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need, Doctor. Abdomen, you say? Just… be gentle, if you would. My wife always tells me I'm too sensitive. But I suppose it’s just part of getting older, isn’t it? Everything gets a little… tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to press gently here and here. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. It feels… slightly tender in the lower abdomen. Not acutely painful, but definitely some sensitivity. I'm also feeling a bit of fullness in the bladder. That's not unexpected, given what you've told me. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope now. Bowel sounds are present, but a little quiet.
PATIENT: Quiet bowel sounds, you say? Well, that doesn’t sound good, does it? I eat plenty, I assure you. My wife makes a lovely borscht. It’s very… filling. Fullness in the bladder, you felt? Well, that’s no surprise. That’s the whole problem, isn’t it? Always feeling full. Is that… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is very common in men your age. It can cause frequent urination, urgency, a weak stream, and feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely. The quiet bowel sounds could be related, or just a separate issue. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer. We'll also do a kidney function test to make sure your kidneys are working properly.
PATIENT: Prostate… what was it? Hyper… something? Enlargement? Oh, goodness. Is that serious? Cancer, you said? A test for cancer? Now, hold on a minute. I don't like the sound of any of this. My wife always said I should have gone to the doctor sooner. But I didn’t want to bother anyone. It’s just… old age, I thought. It’s just… what happens. Are you sure you need all these tests? Can’t you just give me something to… stop going to the bathroom so much?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear about tests like these. BPH itself is not cancer, and it's very treatable. However, it's important to rule out other causes for your symptoms, including prostate cancer, just to be safe. We’re not assuming anything, we’re simply gathering information. The urine analysis is a very simple test to check for infection, which can cause similar symptoms. The PSA test is a blood test that measures a protein produced by the prostate. An elevated PSA level can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons. It's not a definitive diagnosis on its own. I can prescribe you a medication to help with the urinary symptoms, but it's important to know why you’re having these symptoms before we start treatment. It’s best to have a complete picture before making any decisions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… oh, I see. Not cancer, yet. Just… checking. Checking for cancer. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. A little. And the pills… you can give me pills? To stop going to the bathroom so much? What kind of pills are they? Do they have side effects? My wife always worries about side effects. She says everything has side effects these days. I suppose… I suppose you can do the tests. But quick, please. And the pills… let’s get the pills sorted out. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'm ordering the tests now. The lab results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I can prescribe you Tamsulosin. It’s an alpha-blocker, which helps to relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. As for side effects, common ones include dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when standing up quickly, and sometimes a stuffy nose. It can also rarely cause retrograde ejaculation, which means the semen goes into the bladder instead of out the penis during orgasm. It’s not harmful, but some men find it bothersome. I'll give you a handout with a full list of side effects and instructions. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and see how you're doing on the medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Retrograde… what did you call it? Going… backwards? Oh, goodness. My wife is going to have a field day with that one. And dizziness? I get dizzy enough as it is. This sounds… complicated. But I suppose… I suppose I have no choice. Tests, pills, dizziness, backwards… it’s all very… unsettling. Next week, you said? Alright. Next week. Just… please, let the tests be alright. And please, let the pills work without too many… unpleasant surprises. And just… don’t mention the backwards thing to my wife, alright? It’ll be our little secret.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. I understand your concerns. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. I'll keep the "retrograde ejaculation" detail to myself. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the prescription. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And for not laughing about the backwards thing. I suppose it could be worse. My wife is probably right. I should have come sooner. Just… get me back to normal, alright? That’s all I ask. Back to normal.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best, Mr. Segretto. Get well. .
