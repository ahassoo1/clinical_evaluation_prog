DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it’s my eyesight. It’s just…not what it used to be. Seems to be getting worse steadily, and I’m not a young man anymore, though I suppose I keep myself fairly fit. It’s just… inconvenient, to put it mildly. I used to be able to read a newspaper without any trouble at all. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: I see. Inconvenient is certainly one way to put it. And you’ve noticed this decline… how long has it been progressing, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps…the last year or so? It wasn’t sudden, mind you. More of a…gradual fading, if that makes sense. I chalked it up to getting older, to be honest. Though I suppose even things that happen gradually deserve a look when they start interfering with daily life. I do try to stay on top of things, you understand. I'm not one to let things just go.
DOCTOR: A sensible approach. And has this fading been consistent, or have you noticed any periods where it seemed to worsen more quickly, or perhaps even improve a bit?
PATIENT: Improve? No, Doctor, it certainly hasn’t improved. That would be…unnatural. It's been steadily…diminishing, as I said. Though, thinking on it… it does seem a bit worse in the evenings, perhaps? When I'm trying to read after a long day. But that could just be fatigue, I suppose. I do have a rather demanding job, you know. Dealing with… people. It takes it out of you.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue can certainly play a role. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Alcorta, if you don’t mind my asking?
PATIENT: Human Resources. Mostly paperwork, mediating disputes… ensuring everything runs smoothly, as it should. Though, truthfully, a great many people seem incapable of running anything smoothly. It's a thankless task, I assure you. A great deal of…coddling. Honestly, it's a wonder I haven't lost my patience entirely. It requires a level of…tolerance I wasn’t aware I possessed.
DOCTOR: Fascinating. And besides the difficulty with reading, are you experiencing any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… sometimes things seem… hazy around the edges, I suppose. Not constantly, mind you. More of a fleeting impression. And occasionally, when I'm looking at something bright – sunlight, for example – there’s a sort of…spot in my vision. It doesn’t last long, and it's not terribly disruptive, but it's…noticeable. I haven't bothered mentioning it to anyone before, as I didn't want to appear…frivolous. You understand. Men shouldn’t complain about such things.
DOCTOR: I understand. However, even seemingly minor changes deserve attention. Have you noticed any difficulty with depth perception?
PATIENT: Depth perception… hmm. That's a good question. Not…specifically, no. I haven’t been scaling buildings or anything. But, now that you mention it, pouring a cup of coffee has become…slightly more precarious. I used to do it without thinking, and now I occasionally spill a bit. Though that could just be my hand shaking. It’s been a stressful year, as I said. A great deal of… incompetence to contend with. Still, I suppose it's worth noting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain in or around your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain? Heavens, no. I'm not one for dramatics, Doctor. A little inconvenience, yes. A gradual dimming of vision, yes. But pain? Absolutely not. I assure you, I have a fairly high pain threshold. A lifetime of…dealing with difficult personalities will do that to a man. It's more of a…frustration, really. A deeply unsettling feeling that things aren't as they should be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at your eyes. If you'll just follow my gaze... Could you please look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Very well. As long as it doesn’t involve anything…uncomfortable. I've always been rather particular about my personal space, you understand. And bright lights tend to give me a headache. Though I suppose a thorough examination is necessary, as long as it's conducted with a degree of…discretion.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting some mild ptosis in your left eyelid. Visual fields are…slightly constricted, particularly in the periphery. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but… sluggish. Have you ever been diagnosed with glaucoma, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Heavens, no! I've never had a single ailment in my life, apart from the occasional…headache brought on by sheer exasperation. My mother was a very healthy woman, and I inherited her constitution, I assure you. Ptosis, you say? Is that…serious? I do feel a bit…droopy sometimes, particularly after a long day of mediating disputes. It’s probably just fatigue, honestly. Though sluggish pupils…that doesn’t sound very good. Is this going to require…extensive treatment? I have a rather busy schedule, you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Mr. Alcorta. Sluggish pupils and constricted visual fields require further investigation. And the ptosis, while possibly benign, needs to be evaluated in conjunction with the other findings. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes. I'm going to order some basic blood work to check your overall health, and I’d like you to have a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. They will be able to measure your intraocular pressure and assess your optic nerve.
PATIENT: Blood work and…another doctor? Honestly, the bureaucracy of modern healthcare is simply appalling. Is this absolutely necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. A bit fatigued, perhaps, but that's to be expected. I spend my days dealing with…people. But to subject me to more tests and appointments… it’s simply…inconvenient. Can’t you just… prescribe me something to improve my vision? Perhaps some eye drops? Or a stronger prescription for my glasses? I haven't the time for all of this. And frankly, I don't have a great deal of faith in the medical profession these days. It's all just…guessing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, with all due respect, dismissing potential issues based on inconvenience or personal preference is… unwise. Your symptoms, coupled with my examination findings, warrant further investigation. While eye drops or a stronger prescription might offer temporary relief, they won’t address the underlying cause, and could potentially mask a more serious condition. I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes recommending appropriate diagnostic testing. I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, I am not “guessing”. I will write you a referral to a highly-regarded ophthalmologist. They can schedule you for a comprehensive exam within the week. And I will order the blood work. Please schedule it as soon as possible. Would you like me to provide you with the names of some reputable labs?
PATIENT: Very well. Fine. But this is a considerable imposition on my time. A considerable imposition. And I expect a detailed explanation of everything – every test, every procedure – before I agree to anything. I do not appreciate surprises, Doctor. And frankly, I’m beginning to regret coming here at all. I suppose…a list of labs would be acceptable. But they must be conveniently located, and I refuse to wait on hold for an excessive amount of time. Honestly, the inefficiency of modern systems is simply…astounding. Write it down, Doctor. And be quick about it. I have appointments to attend to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are the names and contact information for three reputable labs in the urban area. Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, and City Clinical Labs. I recommend calling ahead to schedule an appointment, as wait times can vary. The ophthalmologist I'm referring you to is Dr. Evelyn Reed. Her office number is 555-123-4567. They will schedule your comprehensive exam. I understand your frustrations, Mr. Alcorta. However, prioritizing your health is paramount. I’m not attempting to cause you inconvenience, but rather to ensure we identify and address any potential issues promptly and effectively. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. I believe that covers it. I expect a full explanation from Dr. Reed, and I trust – hope – that this isn’t a wild goose chase. Honestly, I have far more pressing matters to attend to than…eye tests. I suppose I’ll schedule the appointments. Though I cannot guarantee I will be pleased. And I fully intend to voice my displeasure if this proves to be a waste of my time. Don't bother calling me to follow up. I'll contact you if – and only if – I deem it necessary. Good day, Doctor.
