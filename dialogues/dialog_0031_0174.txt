DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, and my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much, that one. But… I suppose I’ve been a bit down. Just… not enjoying things like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. It's good of you to come in, and it's very common for daughters to encourage their mothers to seek care when they notice a change. "Not feeling yourself" can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to pinpoint. I used to love my work, you know? Lifeguarding, ski patrol… keeping people safe. But now… even getting ready for work feels like a chore. I find myself… withdrawing. Spending more time alone. Not really wanting to be around people, even friends. It's… unlike me. I always enjoyed a good chat, a good laugh. Now... it just feels… heavy. I don’t cry, mind you. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant shift in your usual enjoyment of life, and that’s certainly worth investigating. The change in your motivation and social withdrawal are important to note. When did you first start noticing these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not exactly. Perhaps… six months ago? Around the time of my grandson’s birthday, I think. Everything felt… a little muted then. I just dismissed it as being tired, you know? Getting older. But it hasn’t gone away. If anything, it's… deepened. It’s just… a persistent greyness, if that makes sense. It's not a sharp pain, just… dull. And tiring. It’s terribly tiring.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Nani. A gradual onset is quite common. Six months is a good timeframe to work with. You mentioned it’s tiring—is that physical fatigue, or more emotional exhaustion, or perhaps both?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Definitely both. My body feels… heavier than it used to. Even walking feels like an effort sometimes. But it’s mostly… mental exhaustion. I have trouble concentrating. I used to read a lot, you know? Mysteries, mostly. Now, I can barely get through a chapter without my mind wandering. And everything feels… pointless, if I'm honest. It's a struggle to want to do anything at all. Even things I used to enjoy. It’s… frustrating, really. A waste of time, my daughter says. But I can’t seem to shake it.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly difficult, Nani, and it’s certainly not a waste of time to explore what’s going on. The combination of physical and mental fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and loss of interest is important. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medication. A small dose, thankfully. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that's just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. My doctor, Dr. Anya, used to run routine checks, but I haven't seen her in… well, since before all this greyness started, I think. Nothing else, really. I've been quite healthy, all my life, actually. Which is why this is so… perplexing. It’s not like me to be… unwell.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Controlled hypertension is important to note, and I see Dr. Anya's notes confirm that. I'm also seeing no other major medical diagnoses in her chart. And you said “all this greyness started” around six months ago. Have you experienced any recent life stressors or significant changes around that time—loss of a loved one, financial difficulties, relocation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Six months ago… My grandson, little Femi, he started a new school. A boarding school, quite far away. I was… proud, of course. He’s a bright boy. But also… sad. I used to see him every weekend. Now it's just… visits. And phone calls, which aren’t the same. My divorce was… a long time ago. And financially, I’m comfortable. Not rich, mind you, but comfortable. No, nothing major. Just… Femi. And the quiet, I suppose. The house feels… very empty without him around.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. That’s helpful context. A significant change like Femi starting boarding school, even with the pride you feel, could certainly contribute to feelings of sadness and loneliness. Now, let's talk about your medications. You mentioned a small dose for your blood pressure. What is the name of that medication, and how much do you take?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… the little orange pill. Ugh, I always forget. My daughter handles most of that. Let me think… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, I think. Yes, ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. She puts it in a little pill organizer, you see. Makes it easier for me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate, in that regard. No allergies. I can eat anything, take most medications… I don’t get hives, don’t have trouble breathing. Nothing like that. My daughter always asks, of course. She's very thorough. But no, I’m clear.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Nani. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions about how you've been feeling, just to get a broader picture. Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep—difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My sleep hasn’t been the best. I used to sleep like a log, you know? Eight hours, straight through. Now… I wake up several times a night. Just… lying there, staring at the ceiling. Thinking. Worrying. And then I can't get back to sleep. And I'm not particularly tired during the day, not really. Just… drained. Not sleepy, just… exhausted. It's a strange feeling. And I find myself getting up earlier and earlier. Just… restless.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days, I have no interest in food at all. I just pick at my plate. Other days, I feel… I don’t know… a sort of emptiness, and I eat more than I should. Comfort food, mostly. And I’ve probably gained a little weight, I suppose. Not much, but enough to notice my clothes feeling a bit tighter. My daughter keeps telling me to eat healthier. But it’s hard when… well, when you don’t really feel like anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That’s very helpful. And finally, have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No, never. I wouldn't say I feel… hopeless, exactly. Just… sad. And empty. And tired. But harming myself? No, never. I have a good life, you know? A good family. I’m grateful for what I have. I just… wish I felt like myself again. It’s a strange feeling. A heavy feeling. But no, no thoughts like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open and honest with me, Nani. That’s very important. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. It’s been so long since I’ve been properly examined. My daughter will be pleased you’re being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Your pulse is 72, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Your eyes, ears, nose, and throat all appear normal. Everything appears physically normal at this point, Nani. However, given your symptoms—persistent sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and loss of interest—and the absence of any physical abnormalities, I suspect you may be experiencing depression.
PATIENT: Depression? Oh. I… I hadn’t thought of it that way. I just thought… I was getting old. And missing my grandson. Depression… It sounds so… serious. I’ve never been one for… feelings, you see. Always very practical, very stoic. But… what does that mean? What do we do?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel surprised, Nani. Depression can manifest in many ways, and it doesn’t always present as overwhelming sadness. Fatigue, loss of interest, and sleep disturbances are very common symptoms. It’s also important to remember that depression is a medical condition, just like high blood pressure or arthritis, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. And you’re right, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re overwhelmed with sadness; it can be a subtle shift in your overall well-being. There are several treatment options available, and we can discuss what might be best for you. These include talk therapy—meeting with a therapist to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies—and medication—antidepressants, which can help regulate the chemicals in your brain. We could also explore lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, which can also improve your mood. Before we decide on a course of action, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms—for example, a thyroid problem or vitamin deficiency. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests. Yes, of course. Make sure we haven’t missed anything. And… therapy? I don’t know. I’ve never really talked about my feelings. Always kept everything bottled up, you see. It feels… strange. But if it helps… I suppose I’m willing to try. And medication… I'm a little hesitant about that. Side effects, and all that. But if you think it's necessary… Perhaps we start with the blood tests, then? And we can talk more about the other options later?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable approach, Nani. We'll start with the blood tests to rule out any other potential causes. And we can certainly discuss therapy and medication in more detail after we have the results. There's absolutely no pressure to make any decisions right now. I'm going to write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. You can take this to the lab down the hall, and they’ll draw a small sample of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once you have the results, you can either have them faxed directly to my office, or you can bring them back with you when you come for your follow-up appointment. I'd like to see you back in about a week, once the results are available, to discuss them and formulate a more detailed plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. A week. I can manage that. And fax them, yes, that’s easier. My daughter always says I’m terrible at remembering things. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… reassuring. I feel a little… less lost, now. I suppose I’ll go and get these blood tests done. Is there anything else I should do, or remember?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I’m glad I could help. Just try to relax and take things one step at a time. There’s no need to rush into anything. The only other thing I’d suggest is to try and maintain some level of social activity, even if you don’t feel like it. Spending time with loved ones can be helpful, even if it’s just a quick phone call or a short visit. And if you start to feel overwhelmed or have any thoughts of harming yourself, please don’t hesitate to reach out for help. You can call 911, or you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Otherwise, just focus on getting the blood tests done, and we’ll take it from there. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll remember the number, just in case. 988. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. You've given me something to think about, and... a little hope. I appreciate your kindness. I think I’ll go and get those tests done now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well, and please take care of yourself.
