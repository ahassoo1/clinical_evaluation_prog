DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it's been… concerning me. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen for a few weeks. I understand wanting to get it checked out. That's a good idea. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… hard to describe exactly. It feels fairly firm, not squishy, and it doesn’t really hurt unless I press on it directly. It’s gotten…slightly bigger, I think, but it’s not a dramatic change. It’s just… there. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms, thankfully – no fever, no changes in my bowel habits, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, firm, not squishy, tender to the touch, and gradually increasing in size, but slowly. No other symptoms – that’s good to hear. Now, when you say “lower abdomen,” can you be a little more specific about where exactly it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… sort of in the middle, a little to the left of my belly button. Not right in the center, and not on either side, but leaning a bit left. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly, but that’s the general area. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that helps. Middle, slightly left of the belly button… okay. And has anything caused it, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That’s the thing – I honestly can’t think of anything. No injury, no straining… nothing that I can recall that would have caused it. I’ve been feeling fine otherwise – normal energy levels, no recent illnesses. It just… appeared, really. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that it's unsettling when something appears without a clear cause. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been pretty stable, thankfully. Maybe a pound or two fluctuation, but nothing significant. I haven't been dieting or anything like that. I generally eat… a fairly normal diet, I suppose. Nothing out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight. Now, can you tell me about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well, they’ve been… regular. No constipation, no diarrhea. Nothing different than usual, thankfully. The frequency is normal for me – about once a day. And… no blood in the stool, or any pain when I go. I apologize if that’s too much information.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s important information, thank you. Now, do you have any family history of abdominal problems, like cancer or growths?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some issues with… diverticulitis, I believe, when she was older. But nothing… cancerous, as far as I know. And my father was generally very healthy. I don’t recall any other significant abdominal problems on either side of the family, but I’m not entirely sure. My family isn’t very open about medical history, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it's difficult to get that information. Alright, and finally, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking any medications at all. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches. And… no allergies that I’m aware of. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing like that. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Well, Amy, based on what you’ve told me, it’s difficult to say for certain what this lump is. It could be a number of things, and it’s important to investigate further. I’d like to do a physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. It will involve me gently feeling your abdomen to assess the size, location, and consistency of the lump. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I just want to get to the bottom of it, you know? I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m going to start here, away from the lump, just to get a baseline. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Okay… and now a little deeper… Hmm… Okay, now moving towards the area you mentioned. Okay. I do feel a firm mass, approximately… two centimeters in diameter. It's located slightly left of your belly button, as you described. It’s not particularly mobile, meaning it doesn’t shift easily when I try to move it. It's mildly tender to the touch, and I don’t feel any rebound tenderness, which is a good sign. It's difficult to say definitively what this is based on palpation alone. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging – an ultrasound of your abdomen would be the next step. It's a non-invasive procedure that can help us visualize the mass and determine its nature. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. An ultrasound sounds good. I just want to know what we’re dealing with, you know? I’m happy to proceed with whatever tests you think are necessary. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the ultrasound? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. Getting answers is the most important thing. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to do a lot of preparation. You may be asked to drink some water beforehand to help create a better image, but the technician will let you know if that’s necessary. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the results, it depends on the radiologist’s schedule, but I usually get them within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – if the lump gets bigger, if you develop a fever, or if you experience any pain – please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. 24-48 hours is perfectly acceptable, and I will definitely call if anything changes. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of before the ultrasound? Or… is that all for today?
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing else you need to do specifically before the ultrasound. Just try to relax, and remember to hydrate a bit. The technician will guide you through everything. And no, that’s all for today. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the ultrasound for you now. She’ll also give you some information about the procedure and what to expect. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I'm here to help. And again, thank you for coming in today. I hope we can get some answers soon.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Smetak. I really appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Have a good day.
