DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s what brought me here. Been feelin’ a bit… off, I reckon. Tired mostly. Hope you can help a old lady out.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. And feeling tired is important to note as well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Do you know what your readings have been, roughly?
PATIENT: Readin’s? Not exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she checks it sometimes when she visits. She tells me it's high, that's all I really know. Numbers just… don’t stick with me anymore. She said something about 140 over 90… or maybe it was 150. Honestly, I get confused. It was high enough for her to say I needed to see a doctor, and she’s usually right.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. Your daughter sounds very attentive, and that’s good to know. Readings in that range do warrant a closer look. Now, besides the tiredness and your daughter mentioning high blood pressure, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a headache, not a terrible one, just kinda dull. And my vision gets a little blurry now and then, mostly when I’m readin’ my cook books. But I figured that was just my eyes gettin’ old. I’ve been bakin’ for… well, a long time. Still, it might be somethin’ else, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A dull headache and blurry vision are certainly things we should investigate further. And baking for a long time is a good life! Now, Ms. Steines, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t been to a doctor much over the years. I always tried to stay healthy, good food, lots of movin’ around. My husband, God rest his soul, he had some trouble with his heart, but I never had nothin’ serious. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. I had the flu a couple times, and broke my wrist when I was younger, fallin’ off a horse. That was a bad one. Other than that… not much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. No major medical problems beyond the broken wrist and occasional flu is good to know. And I understand not wanting to come to the doctor unless necessary. Did you have any surgeries related to the broken wrist, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the wrist. They had to set it, of course, and I was in a cast for a good long spell. I think they did some… somethin’ with pins, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don't rightly remember all the details. The doctor fixed it good enough, though. I can still bake, can’t I? That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Steines. Being able to continue baking is very important, and it sounds like the surgery was successful. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well… my mama, she had a weak heart, I reckon. She didn’t live to be very old. And my uncle, on my daddy’s side, he had somethin’ with his sugar, always drinkin’ sweet tea. That was before they knew much about it, though. My husband’s family… they were mostly healthy folks, as far as I know. Not much sickness on that side. Does that help any? I try to remember, but it's been so long.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Steines, thank you. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your uncle's sugar issues is good information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I’ve taken a bit of aspirin over the years for headaches, and some cough syrup when I’ve been sick, but never nothin’ serious. I'm pretty sturdy, usually. Least, I used to be. This tiredness is somethin' new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And we’re trying to figure out this tiredness, and get to the bottom of things. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my joints, sometimes. Doctor recommended it a few years back, said it might help with the arthritis. Can’t remember the name of it now, little blue pill. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, 'cause I don’t get out much when it's cold. Other than that, nothin’. I prefer a good cup of tea to any pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Steines. A good cup of tea is always a good choice. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. I reckon I can’t fight a doctor. Just try to be gentle, dear. Old bones ain't what they used to be. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 158 over 92. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but you have some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, let’s check your pulse and reflexes. Pulse is good and regular. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Overall, you appear well, but there are some things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Well, that sounds like a mouthful. Elevated and diminished… all sorts of things. Is it bad? Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I just want to keep bakin’, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Steines, don't you worry. "Elevated" and "diminished" are just words we use to describe what I found during the exam. The elevated blood pressure does need to be addressed, as it can lead to more serious problems if left untreated. The diminished breath sounds could be due to a number of things, and we’ll need to investigate that further. And the murmur, while present, isn't necessarily a cause for immediate concern. We're going to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We’ll also do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. I’d also like you to get a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs. Based on those results, we can make a plan to get you feeling better and keep you bakin’ for many years to come. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests and X-rays… sounds like a lot of bother. But if it’ll keep me bakin’… alright, do what you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know when and where. I don’t get around as easy as I used to, and my daughter’s got a busy schedule. And try to explain it all to me simple, okay? I don’t understand all those fancy medical words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. I will explain everything in simple terms. I’ll have the order for the blood tests and X-ray sent to the lab and radiology department. The lab is just down the hall, and radiology is on the second floor. I’ll have the reception staff schedule the appointments for you, taking your daughter's schedule into consideration. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to eat a healthy diet, get some gentle exercise, and take your joint supplement as prescribed. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ it all and not makin’ me feel like a fool with my questions. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a cup of tea. All this talkin’ has made me thirsty.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Steines. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, do enjoy that cup of tea. It sounds like you deserve it. The reception staff will help you schedule those appointments, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up.
