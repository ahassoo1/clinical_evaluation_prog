DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne Aslan, 29 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Todoro… uh, TodoroVICH, right? Sorry, names aren’t my strong suit. I’ve just been getting these chills, and they’re kinda bothering me. Not a fever or anything, just… cold.
DOCTOR: TodoroVICH is correct, yes. And "chills" is… quite vague, honestly. Can you tell me when these chills started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe three days ago? It wasn’t constant at first, just every now and then. But yesterday it was pretty much all day. Like, I’d be perfectly warm and then suddenly… shiver. It's weird. I don't think I was doing anything specific when it started, just… normal stuff.
DOCTOR: “Normal stuff.” Right. Well, “normal stuff” doesn’t tell me much, unfortunately. Are these chills accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't felt sick, like with a sore throat or a cough. No headache, no muscle aches… Honestly, that’s what's weird about it. Just… cold, then not cold. I did feel a little tired yesterday, but I figured that was just from work. It's been a long week.
DOCTOR: A long week. And you’re working… where, exactly?
PATIENT: I’m a Health Education Specialist. I work with a community center, mostly doing workshops and stuff – healthy eating, exercise, that kind of thing. It’s… a lot of being on my feet, and talking, you know? Sometimes I go to different locations, different schools and stuff, so I’m around a lot of people. Not that I’m worried about anything, but… it's a thought.
DOCTOR: Right. Community outreach. Interesting. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, honestly. I've been trying to pay attention. No sniffles, no stomach problems… nothing. I did feel a little bit thirsty yesterday, but I drink a lot of water anyway, so I just thought it was that. It's really just the chills, and feeling a little wiped out, but I think that’s probably from running around.
DOCTOR: “Running around” and “feeling wiped out.” So, let’s go through some basic things, just to rule things out. Any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Definitely not. My stomach’s been fine, actually. I had a really good tagine last night, if that helps? Seriously though, no problems there.
DOCTOR: A tagine. Well, that’s good to know. It doesn’t really relate, but alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any… unusual skin rashes or changes in your skin?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a little bit of sunburn on my shoulders last weekend – I was being silly and forgot sunscreen – but it's already fading. Besides that, my skin’s normal. No itchy bumps or anything weird. Honestly, I would have noticed, I'm pretty good about checking myself.
DOCTOR: Right. “Pretty good about checking yourself.” I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been eating normally, maybe a little less when I'm super busy, but nothing drastic. And my weight… it usually stays about the same. I haven't weighed myself in a while, but my clothes fit the same, so I assume it's okay. It's not like I've lost or gained anything noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to be thorough, any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, no travel. Not for ages. Last time I went anywhere was to visit my sister in… well, it was last year, but it was just a road trip to the coast. Nothing international or anything exciting. I haven’t left the state in a long time, actually. Mostly just work and collapsing on the couch when I'm not working.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But nothing serious, no asthma, diabetes, heart problems… nothing like that. I'm generally pretty healthy, if I do say so myself. I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Right. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all of that, thankfully. Just the broken arm when I was seven, and that didn’t require surgery, just a cast. It healed fine. No big scares or anything.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had… something with his cholesterol, I think. But honestly, we don't really talk about medical stuff much. I know my grandma on my mom’s side lived to be really old, though – almost ninety, which is good, right? I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. We’re not a family that keeps good records or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. "Not a family that keeps good records.” And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times when I’ve been sick, and pain relievers when I've needed them, but never any problems. I can eat anything, no food allergies or anything like that either. I’m pretty boring that way, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. No prescription drugs, no herbal supplements, nothing like that. I try to stay away from taking too many pills if I can. I prefer to get my vitamins from food, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, let me get this straight. You're a generally healthy 29-year-old woman who’s experiencing chills, with no fever, no other symptoms, and no significant medical history or family history. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s pretty much it. Just… these weird chills. They're just annoying more than anything, honestly. It's hard to concentrate when I’m shivering, and it's a bit embarrassing sometimes. I was hoping you could tell me what might be causing them, or if I need to worry about anything.
DOCTOR: Well, truthfully, your symptoms are rather… vague. It could be a minor viral infection, although you don’t have any other signs. It’s possible it’s just stress, or even dehydration. But to be certain, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to rule things out. Can I check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your lymph nodes?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so I can get back to normal. Temperature, heart and lungs… okay, sounds good. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything seems… unremarkable. Which, frankly, doesn’t help much. It's possible you are experiencing a mild, self-limiting illness. I recommend plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers if you experience any discomfort. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, come back and we’ll consider further testing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay, I guess. Fluids and rest, got it. It's a bit frustrating that it's not more clear, but if that’s what you think is best, I trust you. I'll try to take it easy and drink a lot of water. And I’ll come back if things get worse. Thank you, Dr. TodoroVICH.
DOCTOR: Right. I'll document everything in your chart. Remember, if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. I’m not ruling things out entirely, simply stating that right now, it appears to be a minor issue. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… try not to worry too much, and get some rest. I appreciate you taking the time to see me, even if it's just a minor thing. Thank you again, Dr. TodoroVICH. I’ll see you if things don’t improve.
DOCTOR: Right. Good. Try to rest. And don’t hesitate to call if something changes. .
