DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I appreciate you seeing me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather peculiar sensation in my back. It’s a sort of… popping, or clicking, feeling. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s definitely noticeable, and a little unsettling, if I’m being honest. It seems to happen most when I’m moving around – bending, twisting, things like that. I work on trains, you see, so I’m constantly in motion.
DOCTOR: I understand. A popping or clicking sensation in your back that occurs with movement. That is unsettling, even if it isn't painful. And working on trains certainly involves a lot of physical activity. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the location of this sensation?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly, but it feels to be centered in my lower back, right around where your spine curves inward. Sometimes it feels a bit to the left side, other times more in the middle. It's not a sharp pain, like a muscle pull, but more like… a mechanical feeling, if that makes any sense. Like something is… shifting. It’s hard to describe, I apologize. I don’t have any numbness or tingling, though, and the feeling doesn’t radiate down my legs.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very helpful description, Mr. Mastrantonio – “mechanical feeling” is quite insightful. And it’s good to hear you haven't experienced any numbness or tingling, or radiation down your legs. That helps us narrow down the possibilities. Now, has this sensation come on suddenly, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: It developed rather gradually, to be honest. I didn’t wake up one morning with it. It started as a very occasional little pop, maybe a month or so ago. I initially dismissed it as just… a normal thing, you know? But it’s been happening more and more frequently over the last few weeks, and that’s what prompted me to come see you. It’s become… noticeable enough to be a concern. I don’t recall any specific incident that triggered it, just a slow increase in frequency.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset without a specific injury. That’s useful information. And you mentioned it’s been increasing in frequency. Would you say it's constant now, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It's not constant. Some days, I barely notice it at all. Other days, especially if I’ve had a particularly busy day working on the trains – lots of bending and lifting – it’s happening quite frequently with almost every movement. So, it seems directly related to my activity level. When I'm resting, or just sitting quietly, it’s usually absent. It’s more pronounced after physical exertion.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. It sounds like this is definitely correlated with your activity. I'm reviewing your chart now… I see you're 40 years old, and your height and weight are listed as 170cm and 129lbs, which is within a healthy range. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Reisig. I’m glad you’re taking a thorough look. To answer your question, no, I don't have any significant past medical history. I’ve been generally healthy my entire life, thankfully. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses. I do have private insurance, which I hope covers this visit. I had a rather bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was it. Otherwise, just the usual bumps and bruises from working with my hands. I've never had any problems with my back before this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant past medical history is helpful. And yes, your insurance information appears to be in order. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. As far as I know, there’s no history of back problems in my immediate family – my parents and my brother. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, had some arthritis in his knees later in life, but nothing specifically related to the spine. My wife’s family… well, her mother had osteoporosis, but again, that wasn’t directly a back issue, more bone density. I believe that’s the extent of any relevant family history, honestly. We haven’t had any major hereditary illnesses to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of back problems. That’s helpful. Now, I’ll ask about social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I used to drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner perhaps – but I’ve stopped completely in the last few years. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I believe in keeping a clean lifestyle, as much as possible. I work hard, and I prefer to stay focused and healthy. My wife and I enjoy spending time outdoors, walking and gardening, so staying fit is important to us.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mastrantonio. A healthy lifestyle is always a good thing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not taking any medications at the moment. Not even over-the-counter things regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s very infrequent – perhaps once or twice a year. I prefer to let things heal on their own, if possible. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but it’s not a daily habit. I really try to get most of my nutrients from my diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or regular supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I do not have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything in the environment. My wife is slightly allergic to bee stings, but I am perfectly fine. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any issues with pollen, dust, or anything like that. I’m quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mastrantonio. That completes my questions for now. I’d like to conduct a physical examination to assess your back and see if we can pinpoint the source of this clicking sensation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Reisig. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’m ready when you are. I’m hoping we can figure out what’s causing this sensation and get it resolved.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could please lie down on your stomach, that would be great. I’ll start with palpation, gently feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I’ll assess your range of motion, checking how far you can bend and twist. Please let me know if anything causes you pain or discomfort during the examination. Okay, I’m starting on your lower back now… I’m not feeling any obvious muscle spasms or areas of acute tenderness at this moment. Just some normal tension. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, reaching towards your feet as far as comfortable. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Alright. That feels… a little tight, but no pain, Dr. Reisig. It’s the same sort of stretching sensation I feel normally when I bend over. The clicking sensation isn’t present while I’m bent over, though. It’s more noticeable when I’m moving back up to a standing position, if that makes any sense. Just a little pop in my lower back.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it’s not present during the forward bend, but occurs on the return to standing. And you’re right, I didn’t hear or feel any clicking as you bent forward. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently twist to the left, as far as comfortable. Again, let me know if anything causes pain or discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That feels… a little stiff, Dr. Reisig. And yes, I felt the clicking sensation just now, on my left side. It wasn’t painful, just… a definite pop. It feels like it’s coming from the lower part of my spine, right where we discussed earlier. It's still more of a mechanical feeling than a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling along your left side now… I don’t feel any obvious abnormalities, but there is some mild tenderness when I press directly on the spinous process of the L4 vertebra. Now, let’s try twisting to the right. How does that feel on this side?
PATIENT: That feels… a little better than the left side, honestly. A bit more comfortable. And no clicking sensation just now. Just a regular stretching feeling. It's interesting that the clicking seems to be isolated to the left side.
DOCTOR: That is interesting, the isolation to the left side. And good to know the right side feels more comfortable. Now, I’m going to assess your reflexes and sensation in your legs to ensure there’s no nerve involvement. This will just involve a quick tap with a small hammer and a light touch with a cotton swab. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Reisig. Please proceed as necessary. I understand you’re just being thorough, and I appreciate that. I’m happy to cooperate. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap the back of your knee with this hammer. Please keep your leg relaxed. Okay, good response on the left. Now, let’s try the right side. And good response on the right as well. Both reflexes are symmetrical and within normal limits. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab and ask you to tell me when you feel it. This is to check your sensation. Can you feel that on your left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that on my left leg. Perfectly clear sensation there, Dr. Reisig. And yes, I can feel that on my right leg as well. No issues with sensation on either side. Everything feels perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Symmetrical reflexes and intact sensation in both legs. That’s reassuring. Based on the physical examination and your history, it appears you likely have a mild facet joint dysfunction in your lower back, specifically on the left side. These joints can sometimes become irritated and cause clicking or popping sensations, especially with movement. It doesn’t sound like there’s any nerve compression or serious underlying pathology, which is good. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: A facet joint dysfunction… no, I don't think I've heard of that before. So, it’s not a muscle problem, or a disc issue? Is that why it's isolated to one side? And what does that mean, exactly? Is it serious? I apologize for all the questions, Dr. Reisig, I just want to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. It’s important to understand what’s going on. A facet joint dysfunction means that the small joints in your spine – the facet joints – aren't moving as smoothly as they should. It's not a muscle problem, although the muscles around the joint can become tense as a result. It's also not a disc issue, although both can sometimes cause back pain. The reason it’s isolated to one side is that one of the facet joints on your left side is likely slightly irritated or misaligned, causing the clicking sensation and mild tenderness. In most cases, it’s not serious. It’s a common condition, often caused by everyday activities or minor injuries. It can be uncomfortable, but it usually resolves with conservative treatment. However, if it doesn’t improve, or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider further investigation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense, thank you, Dr. Reisig. So, what does “conservative treatment” involve? Is it something I can do at home, or do I need physical therapy? And what about the clicking sensation – will that just go away on its own once the joint is moving properly? I’m a bit worried it will become a chronic problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions. Conservative treatment typically involves a combination of things. First, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms, such as heavy lifting or prolonged twisting. Rest is important, but prolonged bed rest is not recommended. I’ll prescribe you a short course of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, to help reduce inflammation and pain. We can also discuss some gentle stretching exercises to help improve flexibility and range of motion. Physical therapy can be very helpful, but it’s not always necessary. If your symptoms don't improve with the above measures after a couple of weeks, we can definitely consider a referral to a physical therapist. As for the clicking sensation, it should resolve once the joint is moving properly and the inflammation has subsided. In most cases, it’s not a chronic problem. However, it’s important to maintain good posture and continue with regular exercise to prevent recurrence. Do you have any questions about those recommendations?
PATIENT: No, that sounds very manageable, Dr. Reisig. Avoiding aggravating activities and some gentle stretching… I can definitely do that. And the ibuprofen is fine. I’m a bit worried about getting a prescription, though – is it something I should be concerned about taking regularly? I try to avoid medication whenever possible. And how long should I expect it to take to see an improvement? I have a fairly physically demanding job, so I need to be able to get back to work as soon as possible. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, by the way. I feel much more reassured now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could reassure you. Regarding the ibuprofen, it's a short course, just a week or two, to help manage the inflammation. It’s generally safe when taken as directed, but like all medications, it can have side effects. We’ll discuss those briefly before you leave. If you have any concerns or experience any side effects, please stop taking it and contact me immediately. As for how long it should take to see improvement, most patients experience some relief within a week or two of starting treatment. However, it can take longer for the clicking sensation to completely resolve. We can reassess in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they’ve worsened, we can consider further investigation, such as an X-ray or MRI. Before we finish, I’m going to give you a written summary of our discussion, including the recommendations and potential side effects of the ibuprofen. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Dr. Reisig. Thank you very much for your time and thorough explanation. I really appreciate it. I'm happy to try the conservative approach and see how it goes. And I will definitely contact you if anything changes or worsens. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel much more optimistic now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. Remember to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Here’s the written summary. I wish you a speedy recovery. Have a good day.
