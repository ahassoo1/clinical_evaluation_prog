DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My name is Lindra. I… I need paper for senior living. My daughter, she make appointment. I need… okay for go there. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here your daughter scheduled an appointment for a medical assessment related to transitioning to senior living. That’s perfectly right. So, we’ll just go through some things to make sure everything is alright for you to move forward with that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you’re considering a move to senior living?
PATIENT: Hmm… Old house. Too big. Too much work for me and my husband. He… he not so good lately. Need help. My daughter say good place. Safe place. I hope so. Is okay place, yes?
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good to plan ahead and make sure you have a safe and comfortable living situation. Your daughter is right to think about these things. And yes, we want to make absolutely certain this is the right place for both you and your husband. To help me with that, could you tell me a little bit about your husband's health?
PATIENT: He… sometimes forget. Not everything, but… important things. Like take medicine. And he fall down last month. Not bad fall, but… scary. He tired a lot now. Sleep much. Doctor see him, but… I don't remember what doctor say. Old age, he say. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me that. Forgetfulness and fatigue, along with a fall… those are definitely things we want to look into a little more closely. It’s good he is seeing a doctor, and “old age” can be a factor, but we want to rule out other possibilities. You mentioned he's tired and sleeps a lot. Has he been experiencing any other changes – in his appetite, his mood, or his ability to do things he used to enjoy?
PATIENT: He not eat much anymore. Just little. And he… he sad sometimes. He sit and look out window. He used to like garden. Now, no. He say… he say he tired of everything. I try to make him happy. I make him favorite food. But… he just eat little. He used to like talk. Now… quiet. Is worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Abdollahi. Those are significant changes, and it's very thoughtful of you to be so attentive to him. We should definitely explore what’s going on. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to his heart and lungs, check his reflexes, and take his blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that okay. Anything to help him. But… he not like doctor. He scare. You… you be gentle, yes? Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. I promise to be as gentle and quick as possible. We'll take our time, and I’ll explain everything as we go. I want him to be comfortable, and I understand his apprehension. First, let's check his blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. 130 over 78. That's a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I'll just listen to his heart and lungs with the stethoscope. His heart sounds regular, and his lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. How about his vision and hearing?
PATIENT: My… my vision okay, I think. I need glasses, but I have. I wear them. Hearing… not so good. I ask people repeat sometimes. Old age. I think. But I can hear you okay now, I think. When you close to me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. We can document those things. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about his medical history – if you don't mind. Has he been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… he have pressure, yes. Doctor say long time ago. He take pill for that. And… I think he have something with water. His leg… swell sometimes. He go to doctor for that too. I forget name of that something. It start with… a "C"? Maybe? I not good with names. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to forget medical terms. It sounds like he might have Congestive Heart Failure, or CHF. That can cause swelling in the legs and feet, and it's often related to high blood pressure. Do you know if he's ever had a heart attack or stroke?
PATIENT: Stroke, yes. Long time ago. He not move arm good for a while. But he get better. He work hard with… with exercise. Go to special place. Make him strong. He very strong man. But now… not so strong. He sleep a lot. I worry.
DOCTOR: It sounds like he's been through a lot, and he’s a fighter. That history of stroke is important information. Now, thinking about medications – what pills is he currently taking, if you know?
PATIENT: Hmm... the pressure pill. White one. And... the water pill. Little blue one. And... something for the pain. He have pain in the hip sometimes. Yellow one, I think. He take them every day. Except... sometimes he forget. And... I think that is all. Maybe? I give him pills. I try to remember. But... I get old too, you know? My daughter help sometimes. She write down. But she not here now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s a lot to keep track of, and it's good he has your daughter’s help. Just knowing about those three pills - the white one for blood pressure, the blue one for water, and the yellow one for pain - is a good start. Now, one last set of questions, if you don’t mind. Have there been any recent changes in his behavior or mood, other than being more tired and quiet?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes he get angry. Little angry. He not like change things. Like move furniture. Or... I change channel on TV. He get little cross. And... sometimes he confused. He ask same question two, three time. He not remember he ask already. It… it scare me. Is that bad? He never be like that before.
DOCTOR: Those are important observations, Ms. Abdollahi, and I appreciate you sharing them with me. Changes in behavior, mood, and memory – especially confusion and repeating questions – do warrant further investigation. Given his history of stroke, recent changes in behavior, and the memory issues you’ve described, I’m concerned about the possibility of early dementia or delirium. It’s important to rule out other causes, like infection or medication side effects, as well. To get a better understanding, I recommend a few tests: a complete blood count to check for infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess his kidney and liver function, and a cognitive assessment to evaluate his memory and thinking skills. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests... okay. If help him. I want help him. But... he not like tests. He scare. Will it hurt him? Please, doctor. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. I understand his apprehension, and I promise we’ll be as gentle as possible. The blood test will just be a small sample from his arm, and the cognitive assessment is simply a series of questions to evaluate his memory and thinking—it won’t be painful at all. It’s like a little puzzle, and we’ll take our time. I think it's important to get a clearer picture of what's going on, and these tests will help us do that. I’ll order them right away, and the lab can schedule him for an appointment. In the meantime, I also recommend a consultation with a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can provide a more detailed evaluation and help us determine the best course of treatment. Would you like me to schedule that as well?
PATIENT: Neurologist… yes, okay. If help him, yes. Please. And… you think he need… special place? For his brain? He… he not so good, you think? I just want him be okay. He good man. Always good man.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, it's perfectly natural to be worried, and you’re a wonderful daughter for wanting to do everything you can for your husband. It's too early to say definitively whether he needs a specialized facility. The tests and the neurologist’s evaluation will give us a much clearer picture. Right now, we need to gather information. The neurologist can assess his cognitive function and determine if he has any underlying neurological conditions. If he does, they can recommend appropriate treatment options, which might include medication, therapy, or, in some cases, a specialized care facility. But let’s focus on getting those tests done first. I'll order them and schedule the neurologist appointment. And in the meantime, is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable or address any immediate concerns you have?
PATIENT: No... no, thank you, doctor. Just... tests and doctor. Okay. And... please be gentle with him. He scare easy. And… you think he know he not so good? He… he ask me things he already ask. Is he… is he know something wrong? I don't want him be scare. I just want him be okay. Thank you, doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s understandable to be concerned about his awareness, and it’s a valid question. It's possible he’s aware of some changes, and it can be unsettling for him. We will be very gentle with him throughout the process. I’ll explain everything slowly and clearly, and we’ll create a comfortable environment. The neurologist is very experienced in working with patients who are experiencing cognitive changes, and they’ll be able to assess his level of awareness and provide appropriate support. I’m going to print out the lab orders and a referral to the neurologist now. The lab will call to schedule the appointment, and my assistant will follow up with you to confirm the neurologist’s availability. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No... no, I think that okay. Just… tests and doctor. And gentle. Thank you, doctor. You very kind. I just want him be okay. That all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. And you’re a wonderful daughter. It’s clear how much you care for your husband. We'll do everything we can to help you both. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. My staff and I are here to support you. Take care, and please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
