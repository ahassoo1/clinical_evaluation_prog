DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… a fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been a bit of a bother, to be honest. I’d like to get it sorted, if we can. Don't have the time for this, really.
DOCTOR: A fever, you say… and it’s recurring. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’ll go away for a day or two, maybe. Then it’s back. Not sky high, you know? More like… warm. Enough to feel tired, definitely. Usually in the afternoons. It started… hmm… about three weeks ago, I reckon. July 10th, maybe the 12th. Something like that. I remember it was hot that week.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… alright. And it seems to be worse in the afternoons, you said. Have you been checking your temperature at all, and if so, do you know what it's been at its highest?
PATIENT: Nah, haven't bothered with a thermometer. I just feel warm, you know? Not like I’m burnin’ up, but definitely not right. My wife usually checks when I'm complainin’ but she’s out visitin’ her sister this week. She'd know the number, but… I'm on my own with this for now. I don’t really like messin’ with all that stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of it, even without a specific number. Feeling warm is a good starting point. Besides the fever, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A little tired, like I said. And… my muscles ache a bit. Not awful, just… sore. Like I did a hard day’s work, even when I haven't. And I’ve had a bit of a headache, on and off. Nothing that a little rest doesn't help, usually. But everything together… it’s just kinda draggin’ me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Muscle aches and headaches along with the fever and fatigue. Have you had any cough, sore throat, congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any skin rash?
PATIENT: No cough, Doc. No sore throat. Definitely no vomiting or diarrhea, thank goodness. No rash either. Just… the aches, the headache, and feelin’ warm. And tired, always tired. It's mostly just feelin' run down, really. And like I said, I don't have insurance, so I’m hopin’ this isn’t somethin’ too serious. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brege. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Now, let's go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, you know? Back trouble, the chiropractor keeps me goin’. He's good. Otherwise, pretty healthy. My wife always tells me I worry too much. She’s probably right. No major illnesses, no hospital stays, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. Avoided those like the plague. My wife wanted me to get my knee done years ago, but I refused. Just… don’t like the idea of bein’ cut open, you know? So, no surgeries. Never needed 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother lived to be 88, pretty healthy for her age. Dad died younger, around 70, heart trouble. My sister has high blood pressure, but that's about it. Nobody with anything serious, you know? Nothing like cancer or anything. Mostly just the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, not a drop. Never liked the taste of alcohol. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. And I quit smokin’… oh, must be thirty years ago. Best thing I ever did, honestly. Just… clean livin’, that's me. Well, as clean as I can be with this back trouble! But no bad habits, Doc. None at all. I’m hopin’ that helps.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Brege. That's very helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Quick is good. I got things to do, you know? But yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be fast, if you can. This is takin' a while.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just sit on the table for me. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, then check your temperature and blood pressure. After that, I’ll have a look at your throat and ears. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. … Lungs are clear. Your temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit. And your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Alright, open your mouth for me… Say "Ahhh." Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears look normal as well. No sign of infection. Everything seems normal, but the fever is still present. It's likely a viral infection, but we need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Viral, huh? So… what does that mean? Do I need… shots? Or pills? I really don't want to be stuck at home sick for weeks, Doc. And I definitely don't have money for a bunch of tests. Can we just get somethin’ for the fever? I just want to feel normal again. Is there anything simple?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brege. A viral infection usually means rest and fluids are the best course of action. There are no specific medications to cure a virus, but we can manage the symptoms. Given your temperature and symptoms, it could be something like the flu or a common cold. However, because the fever is lingering, and you haven't had a definitive diagnosis, I recommend we do a simple blood test just to rule out anything more serious. It will help us be certain. It's a basic test, and relatively inexpensive. We can discuss payment options at the front desk if that's a concern. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and muscle aches. And please, get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please come back immediately. Would you like to proceed with the blood test?
PATIENT: A blood test… honestly, Doc. I really didn't want to do that. But… I guess if it'll make sure it's nothin’ serious… alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. But please, tell me it won’t take all day. And can you guarantee it’s not somethin’ too expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. I really don't want a huge bill. I'm just… tryin' to get back to work. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Brege. We will keep it as quick as possible. The blood test itself only takes a few minutes. And I assure you, we will discuss the cost beforehand and see what options are available to help make it manageable. We can also look into potential assistance programs if needed. Let's have a phlebotomist come in and draw a sample. They will explain the process, and we'll get you taken care of quickly. After we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… get it over with, please. I really don't have time for this. And if it's somethin’ that needs more than a pill… well, just tell me straight. I don’t want any surprises. Just… hurry, okay? I got a schedule to keep. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brege. I'll have the phlebotomist in right away. We'll get this taken care of quickly, and I promise to explain everything clearly once we have the results. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and draw a blood sample for Mr. Brege?
