DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's my skin, really. It's been so itchy lately. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Not a serious thing, I don't think, but very annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cassimatis. Itching can be incredibly disruptive. Let's certainly try to figure out what’s causing it. When did you first notice the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month? It wasn't constant at first, just little spots here and there. But it's gotten worse and spread all over, especially on my arms and back. It’s worse at night, if that makes any sense. I scratch and scratch, and then it gets all red and bumpy.
DOCTOR: That is helpful to know, Ms. Cassimatis. So, it began approximately a month ago, initially localized but now more widespread, particularly on your arms and back, and exacerbated at night. Is the itching accompanied by any visible rash, or is it just redness?
PATIENT: Yes, there is a rash, now that you mention it. It's not…huge or anything, but little bumps, like tiny mosquito bites. And when I scratch – and I have been scratching – they get little blisters sometimes. They don't really hurt, just…itchy. Really, really itchy. I haven’t noticed anything else, no fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Small bumps resembling mosquito bites, with occasional blistering when scratched, and no associated fever. Alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see… not really. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions… oh! Wait a minute. My granddaughter, she came to visit a couple of weeks ago, right around when this started. She had a new perfume, a very strong floral scent. I gave her a hug, naturally, and she was wearing it then. Could that be it? I don't usually have any trouble with perfumes, but maybe that one is different.
DOCTOR: That’s a very pertinent observation, Ms. Cassimatis. A new perfume exposure around the onset of the itching is certainly something to consider. It could very well be a contact dermatitis reaction. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I’m 70 years old, so I’ve got a bit of a history, haha. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, and… oh, and I used to have terrible allergies when I was a child, mostly to pollen. But those cleared up a long time ago. Nothing major, really. I haven't been to the hospital in years. And, honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor much unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Cassimatis. Controlled hypertension, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and a history of childhood allergies that have since resolved. That’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other reason?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. That's the only thing. And I take a calcium supplement sometimes, but not every day. It depends if I remember, to be honest. I'm not very good at keeping track of things like that. I mostly just try to eat healthy and get a little exercise. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don't think I am. I had it a few times as a child, and I was fine. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, too - I love trying new foods when I travel. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I think I would have known by now if I had a serious allergy, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: That is excellent to know, Ms. Cassimatis. No known allergies, which is very reassuring. Now, I'd like to take a look at the rash. Would you mind if I examined your arms and back?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go ahead, please. I'm happy to cooperate however I can. It’s just been so bothersome, I’m glad we’re trying to figure it out. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m examining the skin now. I see scattered erythematous papules – small, red bumps – and some excoriations, which are essentially areas of skin that have been scratched. There's some mild inflammation, and a few small vesicles – tiny blisters – present. The rash appears to be consistent with a dermatological reaction, likely irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. Now, to help confirm my suspicion, and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening or hiking perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not much anymore! When I was younger, yes, I loved gardening. But now I mostly stay inside. I live in a condo, and I have a small balcony, but I don't really do much out there. I enjoy reading and watching television, and visiting my family. I do take a walk around the block sometimes, but that’s about it. Definitely no hiking! I'm more of a city girl now. I haven’t been in a forest in years.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, do you have any pets at home, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I love animals, but I don't have any. I used to have a little poodle when I was younger, but she passed away a long time ago. It's too much responsibility for me now, and I travel a bit to see my family, so it wouldn't be fair to the animal. It's just me in the condo, mostly. Though, my granddaughter sometimes brings her little cat when she visits. A fluffy Persian. Very sweet thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you briefly describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy! I have oatmeal for breakfast most days, and a salad for lunch. Dinner varies - sometimes fish, sometimes chicken, sometimes pasta. I love fruits and vegetables, and I drink a lot of water. I don't eat a lot of processed foods or sugary drinks. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I used to bake a lot, but I don’t anymore – too tempting! I mostly try to stick to simple, wholesome foods. Nothing fancy, but I think I do pretty well. I'm a Puerto Rican woman, so I love my rice and beans! But I try to eat in moderation.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cassimatis. That provides a good overall picture. Based on your history, physical exam, and the information you’ve provided, I believe you are experiencing allergic contact dermatitis, most likely triggered by the perfume your granddaughter was wearing when she visited. The rash is consistent with that diagnosis, and the timing aligns well. Given your age and overall health, and the relatively mild nature of the reaction, I recommend a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and itching. I’m going to prescribe a low-potency hydrocortisone 1% cream. You should apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for the next two weeks. Also, avoid further exposure to the perfume, if possible. And try to avoid scratching, as that can worsen the inflammation and potentially lead to infection. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Hydrocortisone cream… I think I've used that before for something else. And avoiding the perfume makes sense, of course. My granddaughter will understand. Two weeks sounds good. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, a special soap to use, or something? And will this… go away completely? I just don't want it to keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Ms. Cassimatis. As for soap, use a mild, fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid anything with dyes or perfumes, as those can irritate the skin. Something like Dove or Cetaphil would be good choices. Pat your skin dry gently after washing, rather than rubbing. And yes, with consistent treatment and avoidance of the irritant, this should resolve completely. However, contact dermatitis can sometimes recur if you're exposed to the same allergen again. So, it's important to be mindful of new products you're using and avoid anything that seems to trigger a reaction. I’m also going to recommend an oral antihistamine, like loratadine, to help control the itching, particularly at night. 10 milligrams once daily as needed. I’ll write out detailed instructions for both medications, and send them to your pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That's very helpful, Doctor. So, mild soap, avoid the perfume, cream twice a day, antihistamine when itchy… I think I can manage that. My pharmacy is just around the corner, so that's good. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You've been very thorough. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. It's a relief to finally have some answers and a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if the rash doesn’t improve after two weeks, or if it worsens, or if you develop any signs of infection – such as fever, pus, or increased pain – please contact the office immediately. Here’s a summary of our plan for you to take with you. I wish you a speedy recovery. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, Ms. Cassimatis. .
