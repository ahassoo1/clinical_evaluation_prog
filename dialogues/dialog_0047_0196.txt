DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... chronic fatigue, I think they said? It’s just… being tired. Really tired. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It's been going on… a while now, I guess. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right. “Chronic fatigue.” It's a rather vague complaint, isn't it?
PATIENT: Vague is… a good word for it, yes. It’s not like a cold, you know? There’s no sniffles or a cough. Just… heavy. Everything feels heavy. And I sleep, but it doesn’t help. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. Sleeping without feeling rested is a key symptom. And how long have you been feeling this… heaviness, as you call it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. Months, certainly. Maybe even longer? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. My husband… he used to keep track of things. But it's been a few years since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a spouse is… significant. Let’s try to narrow it down as best we can. Has the fatigue been gradually worsening, or has it been more consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. It’s not like it started suddenly. It just… is. Some days are a little better, maybe, but even on those days, I feel like I’m walking through mud. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s a perfectly reasonable way to describe it. And are there any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache, a little. And I get… forgetful. Even more than usual, I mean. It’s just… things slip my mind. I was just trying to remember what I had for breakfast this morning! Honestly, it's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Muscle aches and increased forgetfulness. Has anything specific triggered these episodes of forgetfulness, or is it just general absentmindedness?
PATIENT: Oh, no triggers, not that I’ve noticed. It’s just… random. I might walk into a room and completely forget why I went there. Or I'll be talking to someone and the word just… disappears from my head. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I try not to mention it.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat, when I remember to. Weight… I don’t know. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Everything feels… unimportant, you know? I used to be very particular about those things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, Medicare pays for a few things, mostly for my blood pressure. I think it’s… lisinopril? Something like that. And allergies… no, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to pollen, I think, when I was younger, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure. Good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological assessment. That should give us a better starting point. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. I'm so tired of being tired. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then we'll move on to the rest of the exam. Okay. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/90. Heart rate is regular, but a little on the faster side. Lung sounds are clear. Reflexes are normal. Neurologically... gait is slightly unsteady, and her recall is a bit diminished, as you’ve mentioned. I’m noting some mild cognitive impairment on the assessment.
PATIENT: Mild… cognitive impairment? What does that mean exactly? Is that… bad? I’m really not good with medical words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It means that your memory and thinking skills aren't quite as sharp as they used to be. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, ranging from medication side effects to age-related changes, or even something else entirely. It’s important we rule things out. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and a complete metabolic panel. We should also consider a cognitive screening test, a more formal assessment. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood work… another test… It just feels like a lot. But… if it will help, then yes. Yes, let's do the blood work and the… screening test. I just want to know what’s wrong. And… can we hurry up a little? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve already put in the orders for the blood work and the cognitive screening. The lab is just down the hall, and the cognitive test can be done here in the clinic. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, I’m going to slightly increase your dosage of lisinopril to see if that stabilizes your blood pressure, but we’ll monitor it closely. And to rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue and memory issues, I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Another doctor… Oh, goodness. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But please, can you make it a quick appointment? I really don’t have much energy for a lot of waiting around. And the blood work… do I need to fast for that? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. I’ll print out a list of instructions for you. As for the neurologist, I'm scheduling you with Dr. Anya Petrova. She's excellent, and I've already noted your concerns about waiting times in the referral notes. She prioritizes efficient appointments. I'm also going to prescribe a low-dose vitamin B12 supplement while we await your blood test results, as deficiencies can sometimes cause fatigue and memory problems. Is there anyone who can help you remember your medications and appointments?
PATIENT: No, not really. My daughter lives far away, and she’s very busy. I mostly manage on my own. I’ll try my best to keep track. It’s just… difficult. So, blood work with no food for eight hours, B12… and see Dr. Petrova. Is that everything? I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the core of it. Blood work fasting for eight hours, a daily vitamin B12 supplement, and a neurology appointment with Dr. Petrova. I understand it’s a lot, and I apologize for the overwhelming nature of it. I’ll print out detailed instructions for each item, including contact information for both the lab and Dr. Petrova’s office. And please, don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We’re here to help. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss your blood work results and how you're feeling. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Yes, I suppose so. As long as it’s not too early in the morning. I’m not really a morning person. And if you could just… summarize everything one more time, just to be sure… I just want to make sure I haven't forgotten anything. My memory… you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. So, to recap: You’re experiencing chronic fatigue and some memory issues. We’ve discussed potential causes. First: You need to have blood work done. You must fast – no food or drink except water – for eight hours beforehand. We're checking your thyroid levels and vitamin B12. I'll provide instructions. Second: You're starting a low-dose vitamin B12 supplement daily. Third: You have a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist, for a more comprehensive evaluation. We've requested a prompt appointment, and I've noted your concerns about waiting times. Finally: We’ll follow up in two weeks to discuss your results and your progress. I’ll print everything out for you, including contact information for all parties involved. Do you have any questions right now about any of those steps?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. That sounds… thorough. Just… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’m ready to go now, if that’s alright. I think I need a nap.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. Here are those printouts. Please, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Get some rest, Ms. Licano. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
