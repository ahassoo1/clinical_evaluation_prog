DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s about the cigarettes, you see. I’ve been… enjoying them for a very long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to put a stop to it. A bit late, perhaps, at my age, but better late than never, as they say.
DOCTOR: “Enjoying” them, you say. And how many cigarettes would you say you typically go through in a day, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Ah, a fair question. Let me think… for the last, oh, ten years or so, it’s been roughly a pack and a half. Sometimes a little more if the weather is particularly… challenging. Though I did smoke more when I was younger, working in the factory. Perhaps two packs a day then. It’s… a habit, you understand. A long one.
DOCTOR: A pack and a half for ten years… That’s a significant history, Mr. Knoch. And have you attempted to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, several times. Mostly on my own, you understand. Trying to simply… not smoke. That lasted a few days, maybe a week at the most. Once, a friend suggested those patches. Those… didn’t agree with me. Made me feel rather unwell. And another time, I tried chewing gum. Seemed silly, really. It’s not the same sensation, you see. It just… wasn't effective. I never really got very far with any of it. And truthfully, I haven’t spoken to a doctor about it before today.
DOCTOR: Right. And outside of the patches and gum, have you noticed any other symptoms you’d attribute to your smoking?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Well, I do get a cough, naturally. A bit of a morning cough. Always have, but it seems… more persistent lately. And I tire a bit easier than I used to. Walking up the stairs, for example. Used to be able to bound up them, but now… now it requires a bit of a pause halfway through. And my doctor back home – Dr. Stankevicius, a very good man – he always told me my lungs sounded a little… rough. Though he never specifically said it was from the cigarettes, you understand. He just said I had a “smoker’s cough”. Is that… serious?
DOCTOR: A persistent cough and shortness of breath are certainly concerning, Mr. Knoch. A “smoker’s cough” is often the first sign of damage to the lungs. We need to assess the extent of that damage. Do you experience any wheezing or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain, thankfully. And wheezing… not regularly, no. Sometimes, when the air is very cold and damp, I might feel a little… tightness in my chest, but it passes quickly. I wouldn’t call it wheezing, exactly. More of a… constriction. It’s hard to explain. I wouldn’t say it happens often, though. Perhaps a few times during the winter months. Is that something to be worried about? And what sort of assessment are we talking about? I’m not fond of… poking and prodding, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Poking and prodding” is a rather… colorful description, Mr. Knoch. However, a physical exam is necessary. I'll need to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and assess your overall health. Then, I strongly recommend a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s happening in your lungs. It's standard procedure, and frankly, essential given your history. Do you have any allergies to medication that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Dr. Stankevicius always asked, and I never had any reaction to anything he prescribed. Just the usual… sensitivity to the cold, perhaps. I catch a chill easily. As for the examination… very well. If it’s necessary. I suppose I understand. Though I must admit, I am a little anxious about the X-ray. I’ve heard… things. About radiation and such. Is it perfectly safe? And will it be painful? I would appreciate a thorough explanation, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is extremely low, Mr. Knoch – far less than you receive from a cross-country flight. It’s a quick procedure, and the benefits of detecting any potential problems far outweigh the minimal risk. As for pain, no, it’s completely painless. You simply stand or sit while a machine takes a picture. Now, before we proceed with the exam and imaging, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you currently live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do live alone. Have for… well, quite some time. Lost my wife, Elena, nearly fifteen years ago. A good woman, she was. Very patient. And no children, unfortunately. Just me, these days. I keep myself busy, though. I do a bit of gardening, mostly. And I enjoy reading. History books, mostly. Lithuanian history, of course, but also European history in general. It helps pass the time. Is this… relevant to stopping smoking, Doctor? I sometimes feel a bit foolish discussing my personal life with a physician. It feels… intrusive, perhaps.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant because social support is crucial when attempting to quit smoking. Loneliness and boredom can be significant triggers. Now, let’s move on to your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a small dose of aspirin every morning, just for general aches and pains. Dr. Stankevicius recommended it years ago. And sometimes, if I’m really feeling stiff, I use a bit of liniment on my joints. But that's all. No vitamins, no supplements. I always preferred a good, healthy diet. My wife was a wonderful cook. She made everything from scratch. And, truthfully, I don't believe much in those… pills and potions, you understand. Natural remedies are always best, in my opinion. Though I suppose, if a doctor prescribes something… that’s different.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with the physical exam then. Please, have a seat on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose it’s time. It feels rather… undignified, at my age. But if it’s necessary… There. Is that alright, Doctor? I do hope it won't take too long. I always feel a bit of a chill when I'm exposed like this. It's the circulation, you understand. Not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… deeper. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated, Mr. Knoch, and I do hear some diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes of both lungs. There's also some mild wheezing on auscultation. Your blood pressure is a little high as well – 145/90. Based on this initial assessment, your history, and these findings, I strongly recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung disease. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: That… doesn't sound very promising, does it? Diminished breath sounds, wheezing… It seems my lungs aren’t in the best condition. I suppose I expected as much, after all these years. Still, it’s… unsettling to hear it confirmed. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this moment, Doctor. If you think the X-ray is necessary, then let’s proceed. Though… where exactly will this X-ray take place? Is it in the same building? And will I need to change back into my clothes afterwards? I wouldn’t want to catch a chill. It's… a delicate matter, you understand.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will be performed in the imaging department, just down the hall on the second floor. You don’t need to change back into your clothes; you’ll wear a hospital gown. A technician will guide you through the procedure. It should only take about ten to fifteen minutes. I will review the results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. Are you able to walk down the hall on your own, or would you like me to call for assistance?
PATIENT: I believe I can manage on my own, thank you. I’m not entirely incapacitated, you understand. Though… perhaps a little slower than I used to be. Down the hall, you say? On the second floor? Very well. I suppose it’s time to face the music. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency. Though… a little more reassurance would have been welcome, perhaps. But I understand you’re a busy woman. Very well. Down the hall it is.
