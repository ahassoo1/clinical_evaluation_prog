DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. I need a… a permission slip, I guess you’d call it. For somethin’ the… the fella down the street is doin’. Some kinda… fixin’ up. He needs to know if I'm… alright to let him do it. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you’re looking for medical clearance for something a gentleman down the street is offering. To help me understand what kind of clearance you need, could you tell me a little more about what this "fixin’ up" involves?
PATIENT: Fixin’ up… well, it’s… look, it’s my face. He says he can make it… smoother. Less… worn. I don't rightly recall all the details he told me. Somethin’ about… fillin’ it in. He showed me pictures, but honestly, they all looked the same to me. I just wanna make sure I ain't gonna… fall apart if I let him. Is that clear enough? I don't do well with a lot of explainin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Honcoop. It sounds like this gentleman is offering a cosmetic procedure to your face, possibly involving fillers to address wrinkles or volume loss. To properly assess whether you’re a suitable candidate, I’ll need to ask you a few questions about your medical history, any medications you take, and your general health. First, have you ever had any cosmetic procedures done before?
PATIENT: Cosmetic procedures… hmm. I… don’t rightly recall. Maybe. A long time ago. Somethin’ with… a needle, perhaps? Old Doc… Henderson, I think his name was. But that was decades ago. I can’t rightly say what it was for, or if it even was cosmetic. I mostly just remember the bill. Does that help? I don't keep good track of things, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Honcoop. It’s not uncommon to forget details over time. Knowing that you may have had a procedure with Dr. Henderson is helpful. Next, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take somethin’ for my… waterworks. Gets a bit… troublesome, you understand. Small blue pill. And sometimes, when my joints act up, I take somethin' from the drugstore. White, I believe. That’s all I can think of right now. I mostly just tough it out, though. Don’t like bein’ beholden to pills, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, a small blue pill for your prostate, and a white pill for joint pain when needed. Do you happen to know the names of these medications, or perhaps what conditions your doctor prescribed them for?
PATIENT: Names? Doctor gave ‘em to me years ago. I just take ‘em when I need to. Prostate… he said somethin’ about gettin’ older. And the joints… arthritis, I think? It flares up now and then. Look, I ain't one for rememberin’ fancy names, Doc. I just go to the drugstore, tell ‘em what I need, and they hand me somethin’. Is that gonna be a problem? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, that’s not necessarily a problem. It does make things a little more challenging, but we can work with it. Knowing you have a history of prostate issues and arthritis is helpful. Before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, you askin’ a lot of questions. I’m an old man. Things ache. I get tired. I’m… worn out, alright? Never been told I had any of those fancy diseases. Heart’s been thumpin’ for sixty-four years, hasn’t stopped yet. And my blood pressure? Doc Henderson used to check it. Said it was… acceptable. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t go to doctors much. They always tell me somethin’s wrong. Just wanna get this face thing taken care of and be done with it. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, that's not too much to ask at all. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions. I just want to make sure I have all the information necessary to assess whether this procedure is safe for you. Given your history of "getting by" and not seeing doctors frequently, and considering your age, I would like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your face. Would that be alright?
