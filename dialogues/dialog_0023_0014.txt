DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Hmm… well, my wife, bless her heart, she said I need to get some papers filled out. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things? It's a bit fuzzy, to be honest. She handles most of that sort of thing. I work with the church, you see. Religious activities and education. It’s…well, it's important work. But these papers… FMLA, was it? Or disability? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Right. FMLA or disability… that suggests there's a health concern prompting this paperwork. Let’s focus on you for a moment, Mr. Limtiaco. Forget the forms for now. Can you tell me what’s been going on with your health?
PATIENT: Oh, my health… well, I’m 67, Doctor. Things creak a bit, you know? I get tired easier than I used to, that's for sure. And… sometimes I just feel… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not quite right. It's hard to explain. My memory isn’t what it used to be either. My wife says I repeat myself. Honestly, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast. Is that… is that what you're looking for? I just assumed it was getting older.
DOCTOR: "Just getting older" is rarely a diagnosis, Mr. Limtiaco. We need specifics. You mentioned fatigue and feeling “off”. Can you describe this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… specifics. Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep all day, Doctor. It’s more like… everything takes more effort. Even getting up in the morning. And after I’ve been doing something for a while – even something I enjoy, like talking to folks at the church – I just feel… drained. Like the battery is low. It used to be I could go all day, but now… I need to sit down a lot more. And I find myself… forgetting what I was talking about mid-sentence, sometimes. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue that impacts your ability to perform daily activities, and some cognitive difficulties – specifically, memory lapses during conversation. When did you first notice these symptoms?
PATIENT: When did I first notice… That’s a tricky one. It didn't happen overnight, you see? It's been… gradual. Maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer? It started with just feeling a bit more tired than usual. Then the memory… well, my wife started gently correcting me more often. She's very patient, thank goodness. I'd say within the last three months it’s become… more noticeable, both to me and to her. I'm not sure if that helps. Everything feels a bit blurred, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I see no previous records of complaints like this. Have you seen any other doctors recently for these issues, or had any tests done?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Like I said, I just figured it was getting older. I don't usually bother the doctors unless something’s really broken. And honestly… I haven’t been feeling sick, you know? Just… tired and forgetful. My wife suggested coming here, said it's better to check things out. She worries. I haven’t seen anyone else about it. No tests, nothing. This is… well, this is the first time I’ve really talked to anyone about this.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to rule out some possibilities. Let’s start with a basic physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological assessment – that’s just to check your reflexes, balance, and some basic cognitive function. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I still have work to do at the church, you see. And my wife… well, she needs me. Go ahead, please. Just… try to be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance is slightly impaired, requiring some support. Now, I asked you to remember "apple, table, pencil". Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… Hmm… Let me see… Apple… and… um… Oh dear. It’s right on the tip of my tongue. Table… and… I… I can’t quite remember the third one. Pencil? Was it pencil? I’m so sorry, Doctor. This is embarrassing. I knew this would happen. My mind just… isn’t what it used to be. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Mr. Limtiaco. Recall is diminished. We will need some blood work to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. I also want to order a Vitamin B12 level and a thyroid panel. And, I’m going to recommend an MRI of the brain, just to get a clearer picture. I understand this may sound concerning, but we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that… is that because you think it might be something bad, Doctor? My wife… she's been mentioning something about her aunt having… well, I don't remember exactly what, but it involved forgetting things. And… I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily. But… if it is something like that… what does that even mean? Is there… is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand your concern. An MRI is a diagnostic tool; it doesn't automatically indicate a problem. It will help us identify any structural abnormalities that might be contributing to your symptoms. As for your wife’s aunt, I can’t speculate on her condition. We need the results of the tests before we can determine the cause of your cognitive difficulties and fatigue. There are several possibilities, and we need to rule them out systematically. I will order the blood work and the MRI today. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation once we have the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds acceptable. Whatever you think is best. Just… please, keep my wife informed. She worries terribly. And… if it is something serious, please… be honest with us. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news. Thank goodness she’s so strong. I don’t know what I’d do without her. So… the lab will contact me? And then… I see the neurologist? I think that's everything, isn’t it? I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
