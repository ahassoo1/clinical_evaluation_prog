DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you too, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I’ve been going to the restroom quite a bit lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s… disruptive, really. I'm not entirely sure why it’s happening, and that’s why I thought I should come in. I apologize if that’s a rather… vague explanation. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verbos. It’s perfectly alright to start there. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Going to the restroom quite a bit lately” is a good place to begin. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, let me think… it’s… frequent. Throughout the day, and… sometimes during the night as well. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, precisely. Just… a constant urge. And a fair amount of… volume, if you understand my meaning. It's been going on for… oh, goodness. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say exactly. Time does seem to slip away these days. I do find myself drinking a normal amount of water, I believe. Not excessive, certainly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. That’s helpful. “Frequent urination, several weeks in duration, not associated with pain, normal fluid intake…” We’ll get to the bottom of this. When you say “fair amount of volume,” could you estimate how many times you’re going in an hour, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear, estimating… that’s always been a struggle. Let me see… if I’m being honest, perhaps… two or three times an hour? Possibly more when I'm actively trying to focus on something. It's… a distraction, you see. I have to keep… interrupting myself. And the amount itself… it’s more than a typical… visit, I would say. A considerable amount, really. I apologize for the imprecise language, Doctor. It's not a topic one typically discusses with such… detail.
DOCTOR: You’re not apologizing to me, Mr. Verbos. It’s my job to ask these questions. And you are doing just fine. “Two to three times an hour, larger volumes…” Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Goodness. That’s a question. I… I suppose not dramatically. It looks normal, if that makes sense. The usual color, I presume. I haven’t noticed any blood, or… anything unusual floating in it, thankfully. Though, to be perfectly honest, I don’t examine it with great scrutiny. I simply… go. It’s difficult to say with any certainty, you see. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, either. Everything’s a bit… blurry these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. No blood, normal color as far as you can tell… Okay. Besides this increased frequency, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think carefully. Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been feeling rather… thirsty lately. Perhaps more so than usual. I find myself reaching for water frequently, which… seems counterintuitive, given the situation. And… I’ve been feeling a bit more tired, I suppose. Just… generally fatigued. Nothing dramatic, but… a noticeable difference. I also seem to be sleeping less soundly. I wake up quite a bit during the night, which is… unpleasant. I suppose those are the most noticeable things. Do any of those sound… concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are all potentially relevant, Mr. Verbos, thank you for sharing. Thirst, fatigue, and disrupted sleep, alongside the frequent urination… We need to rule out a few things. Now, have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in diet… That’s a good question. Let me see… Not dramatically, no. I haven’t started any new… regimes, or anything of the sort. I’ve been eating fairly… consistently, I suppose. Mostly traditional Czech cuisine – soups, stews, roast meats… nothing out of the ordinary. I do enjoy a bit of beer with my meals, of course, but I haven’t increased my consumption significantly. I’ve always enjoyed a good Pilsner. Could that be… related, do you think? I apologize for rambling, Doctor. I tend to do that when I'm… flustered.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verbos. It's helpful to have a complete picture, and the Pilsner is good information. It could contribute, as alcohol is a diuretic, but we need to explore other possibilities. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… hmm. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, when I was… oh, goodness, in my thirties, I suppose. I recovered fully, thankfully. And I’ve always had slightly elevated blood pressure, which I manage with… medication. A small pill each morning. Other than that… nothing significant, to my knowledge. I’ve always been relatively… healthy, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-two, so I suppose good genetics are on my side. I do recall having some minor knee pain occasionally, but that’s hardly… a condition, is it? I apologize if I’m being… unhelpful. My memory, as I’ve mentioned, is… fragmented.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Verbos. Pneumonia in the past, hypertension managed with medication – that’s important to know. And the family history is useful as well. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the one for the blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I don't recall being prescribed anything else recently. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's… hardly a medication, is it? A bit of extra zinc and vitamin D, that's all. I occasionally use a cream for my… dry skin, but that's purely cosmetic. I do try to be mindful of my health, you see. I don't believe in self-medicating unnecessarily. Is there anything else I should be mentioning, Doctor? Perhaps something I've… forgotten? It's a distinct possibility, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. We've covered a good deal of ground. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed at your leisure. I may not be the most… informative patient, but I’ll do my best to remain still and provide any assistance you require. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I should be doing. I apologize in advance if I… fidget. It's a habit, you see. Do you have a gown or… is this a simple examination?
DOCTOR: A simple examination will do, Mr. Verbos. No gown necessary. Just please lie back on the examination table and relax. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or organomegaly. Everything appears normal on initial examination, Mr. Verbos. However, given your symptoms and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few laboratory tests to rule out some possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… prudent, certainly. Laboratory tests are a sensible precaution. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your professional opinion entirely. What sort of tests are you thinking of? I confess, I don't have a great deal of medical knowledge. Would it be a blood test? A urine sample, perhaps? Just let me know what’s involved. I’m happy to cooperate. And… will the results take long? I have a… gardening commitment next week, and I wouldn't want to… disrupt it unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. We’ll start with a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel – which assesses kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a urinalysis to check for infection, glucose, and other abnormalities. A PSA test might also be beneficial given your age. These tests will require a blood draw and a urine sample. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. I’ll have my assistant schedule you for the blood draw and provide you with instructions for collecting the urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and urinalysis… I shall remember those names, if I can. And the… PSA test, of course. Three to five business days… that should allow me ample time for my gardening. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and… clarity. Please, do let me know if there’s anything else I should be doing in the meantime. Perhaps avoiding certain foods, or increasing my fluid intake? I'm eager to cooperate in any way I can. And… will there be a cost associated with these tests? My… insurance situation is somewhat… complicated, you see. Medicare, primarily, but there are… deductibles involved.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I'm glad I could clarify. For now, no need to make any changes to your diet or fluid intake. Continue as you have been. Regarding the cost, yes, there may be some out-of-pocket expenses depending on your Medicare coverage and deductible. My assistant will verify your coverage and provide you with an estimated cost before the tests are performed. We also have a billing department that can assist you with any questions you may have regarding your bill. I'll have my assistant schedule the lab work for you now and provide you with all the necessary instructions. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been most… informative and reassuring. I appreciate your thoroughness and… patience with my fragmented recollections. I'm confident that the laboratory tests will shed some light on the situation. And thank you for explaining the… financial aspects of the procedure. It’s a relief to know that assistance is available. I shall await instructions from your assistant regarding the lab work. And I promise to… try my best to remember everything. Perhaps I should take notes. Yes, that’s a good idea. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. It’s been a pleasure meeting you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And don't worry too much about remembering everything – that's what we're here for. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss your results.
