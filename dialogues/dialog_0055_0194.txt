DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. It’s hard to explain, really. Things just… go quiet sometimes. And I get dizzy. It’s happened a few times now. My husband… he used to have something similar, I think. Though, that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: "Quiet," you say. And dizziness accompanies this…quiet?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The quiet… it’s like someone turned down the volume. And then the room starts spinning. Not always, but often. It doesn't last long, usually. Just… a few moments. It's unsettling, though. Makes me feel quite off balance. I worry a bit, you see.
DOCTOR: “Unsettling,” yes. I understand. And can you describe when this occurs, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? That’s a tricky one. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting and reading, other times when I’m… well, doing anything, really. It’s quite random. I wish I could pinpoint it, but my memory isn't what it used to be, you know? It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Random occurrences are… less helpful, naturally. Now, Ms. Mayhugh, have you experienced any hearing loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… hearing loss? Well, I wouldn't say loss, exactly. It's more like… muffled, sometimes. Like there's cotton in my ears. It comes and goes with the quiet and dizziness. Everything sounds a little… distant. It’s hard to explain. Is that what you mean by loss? I don’t know… I mostly just turn up the television.
DOCTOR: "Muffled," and accompanied by the dizziness. Very well. Now, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Oh, just the usual for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes something for my arthritis, when it flares up. I can’t recall the names, to be honest. My daughter usually handles refilling them. She's good with all that. I just take what she gives me. Does that make sense? It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: "A bit of a blur," yes. It is… preferable to have accurate records. Do you happen to know the dosage of your blood pressure medication, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosage? No, I don't. I really don't keep track of those things. I just take one in the morning, I believe. It’s a small one. Honestly, I’m terrible with details like that. My daughter, Leilani, she would know. She brings all my pills and tells me what to take each day. Perhaps… perhaps you could call her? She's very organised. I don't want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate Leilani’s assistance, Ms. Mayhugh, it is… imperative that you have awareness of the medications you are ingesting. However, we can proceed… for now. Have you experienced any recent head trauma or illness?
PATIENT: Trauma… no, not that I recall. I’m quite careful, you see. I haven’t fallen or bumped my head recently. As for illness… well, I had a little cold last month, I think. Just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing serious. The usual sort of thing for this time of year. It didn’t last long. It didn't feel connected to my ears, though. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering all these things. I just want to feel better, you know? Is there anything… anything I can do to help you figure this out?
DOCTOR: Very well. I would like to perform a brief physical examination of your ears, Ms. Mayhugh. And, if you do not mind, I will check your blood pressure as well. It would be best to have current readings. Please, recline slightly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Yes, go ahead. I’ll try to stay still. Recline, you say? Just be gentle, dear. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… is this going to take long? I have a bit of a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It should not be prolonged. Now, please open your mouth wide and say "Ah." Hmm. The tympanic membrane appears… slightly dull. Mild retraction. Now, the right ear… Similar findings. Moderate cerumen impaction in both ears. No visible signs of acute infection. Blood pressure is 145/90. Slightly elevated. The examination reveals cerumen impaction and mildly elevated blood pressure. We will address the cerumen first. It may be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Cerumen… is that bad? And elevated… oh dear. So, the wax is causing the quiet and dizziness? I see. Well, that's good to know. Can you just… remove it? Will that help? I really just want to hear properly again. And is my blood pressure something I should worry about? It’s just… I don’t want to get too worked up about it.
DOCTOR: Cerumen impaction can indeed contribute to muffled hearing and, in some cases, vertigo. Removing it is the logical first step. It's a fairly straightforward procedure. As for your blood pressure… it is not critically high, but it warrants monitoring. We will discuss lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication. I will now perform a cerumen removal using irrigation. It may be slightly uncomfortable, Ms. Mayhugh, but it should be brief. Please, remain still.
PATIENT: Oh… irrigation? Is that… water in the ear? Well, if you think it’s best. Just… please be careful. I don’t like things going in my ear. And brief is good. Very good. I suppose I should close my eyes? I hope Leilani isn’t waiting for me at the bridge club. She gets rather cross when I'm late.
DOCTOR: There appears to be a significant amount of cerumen. Continuing irrigation… The majority of the cerumen has been removed. Your hearing should improve over the next few hours. I recommend avoiding water exposure for the next 48 hours. Now, let us discuss your blood pressure. It is important to adopt a healthier lifestyle… reduced sodium intake, regular exercise, stress management… and I will prescribe a low-dose diuretic to assist with regulation.
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't so bad, actually. A little strange, but not painful. I can almost… almost hear better already. Thank you, Doctor. A diuretic, you say? More pills? I suppose I should try harder with the salt. And exercise… well, I do enjoy a gentle walk, when the weather is nice. Stress… that's a difficult one. My daughter worries so much, it stresses me out! I’ll try my best. But honestly, Doctor, it's a lot to take in. Could you perhaps… write all of this down for me? Just so I don’t forget anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. It is always… prudent to have written instructions. Here you are. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily. And this list outlines the recommended lifestyle adjustments. I also advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any adverse effects from the medication, contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Hydrochlorothiazide… Yes, I see. And less salt… that will be a challenge. I don't think so, not at the moment. I suppose I just… worry about remembering everything. But I’ll do my best. Thank you again for your help, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I believe that will be all. .
