DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought maybe you could take a look. It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying. I’m Teretha Uzarski, by the way.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. It is good to meet you. And I understand – tingling can be quite bothersome, even if it’s not painful. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just my fingertips, other times it’s all the way up my arm. And my feet too – the tops and the soles. It seems worse when I’m… well, when I've been on my feet all day. I deliver mail, you see, so I’m walking a lot. It’s been happening for…oh, maybe three months now? Hard to say exactly. I don’t pay much attention to dates, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Three months, okay. And it’s definitely related to being on your feet a lot, it sounds like. That’s helpful to know. Does it happen at any other time, or is it only when you’re walking and delivering mail?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s mostly when I’m working, yeah. But sometimes, even when I’m sitting and relaxing, I’ll get a little bit of it in my hands. Not as bad, just… a little fluttery feeling. And if I’m cold, it seems to get worse, too. My house isn’t always the warmest, you know? Old pipes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more pronounced with activity and cold temperatures, and you experience it sometimes even at rest, though less intensely. That gives us a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. No, not really. I mean, I get tired, of course, after a long day of walking. But that’s just… being 63, I guess! And my knees ache sometimes, but that's old age too. I haven’t noticed anything different besides the tingling. No weakness, no numbness… just the pins and needles feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no weakness or numbness, just the tingling sensation. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with diet. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I had a bit of arthritis in my hands years ago, but it wasn't too bad. That’s about it, really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. My husband, God rest his soul, always took care of all that.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s perfectly alright if it’s been a while since your last check-up. We’ll get things sorted out. Did you take any medications for the high blood pressure, and are you currently taking anything at all, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I did take a pill for the blood pressure, a little white one. But the doctor said my diet was good enough, so I stopped taking it, maybe five or six years ago. And no, I don’t take anything now. Not even vitamins, to be honest. I try to get what I need from my food. I do take a little ibuprofen sometimes for my knees, but that's about it. And only when they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just ibuprofen occasionally for your knees. And you haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had a reason for one, thank goodness. And no hospital stays either. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Just the usual colds and flu over the years. Nothing serious. My husband, he… well, he had a heart problem, and he spent some time in the hospital, but that was years ago.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother, she had diabetes, I think. And my father, he had high blood pressure, like me. And… oh, my brother, he had some kind of nerve problem in his feet, but I don’t really know much about it. We weren’t very close. He lived far away. It wasn’t anything bad, I don’t think, just… uncomfortable. That’s about all I know, really. We didn't talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and a nerve problem in your brother's feet. That's helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once, a long time ago, but he didn't like it. And I always told him it was a silly habit. I don't care much for the smell, either. I prefer fresh air.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small glass, though. Nothing more. It helps me relax. My husband liked a beer, but I never really cared for it much. It doesn’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine occasionally. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I might get a little heartburn sometimes, but that’s just from eating too much. And I’ve never had a problem with bees or pollen or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Can we be done now? I need to get back to sorting the mail. It’s piling up!
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly proceed. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly, Teretha. It sounds like you've given me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really do need to get back to the post office. The supervisor is already giving me looks. And I have a lot of mail to sort. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? My hands aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your reflexes are good. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your hands and feet. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Is that alright? I don’t have a very strong grip anymore, I’m afraid. Years of sorting mail, you know? It takes a toll on your hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine, Teretha. It's a little weaker than I'd expect, but not significantly. And now, can you push your feet against my hand like this?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little difficult. I haven’t really been doing much… exercising, lately. It's hard to find the time, with the mail and everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this. Please tell me when you feel it. It’s a very light touch, so just let me know as soon as you feel anything at all. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… but be careful, okay? My skin is sensitive. And it tingles already, you know? So it might be hard to tell. But yes, go ahead. Just… don't poke me too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay… and here… and here… Alright, it seems like the sensation is a little bit reduced in the tips of your fingers and toes, but otherwise it's pretty good. Okay, everything sounds good. So, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage that can cause tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hands and feet. It's often caused by diabetes, but can also be caused by other things, like vitamin deficiencies or certain medications. Your examination findings are consistent with this possibility. However, to be certain, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… neuropathy? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? I don’t have diabetes, do I? I thought I would know if I had diabetes. And what about the blood tests? Will they hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Teretha. Neuropathy can be serious, but it’s also often manageable, especially if we catch it early. The good news is, the blood tests will help us determine the cause and the best course of treatment. And no, you haven’t mentioned any symptoms of diabetes, and you said you haven’t been diagnosed with it. The blood tests will help us rule that out or confirm it. As for the needles, it’s just a small prick. Most people don’t find it very painful. We’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It only takes a few seconds, and the nurse is very good at it. We'll also check your thyroid, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Would you be comfortable with me ordering those blood tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, I suppose so. If it will rule things out, then yes. But please, tell the nurse to be gentle. And can I still deliver the mail while I’m waiting for the results? I can’t afford to take time off, you know? The supervisor… well, she’s not very understanding. And what if it is something bad? What if I need to stop delivering the mail?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teretha. I will make a note for the nurse to be as gentle as possible. And yes, you can continue delivering the mail while we’re waiting for the results, unless the blood tests show something that would require you to stop. We'll discuss that if that becomes necessary. It's important to remember that we haven’t made a diagnosis yet. The blood tests will give us more information. If the tests do reveal something, we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan that works for you. We can explore potential modifications to your work, if needed, and I can provide a note for your supervisor if necessary. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I'll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab at [Name of local lab]. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. The results usually take a few days. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay… a requisition form. And [Name of local lab]… I think I know where that is. And a few days… alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… please make sure the nurse is gentle. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I was really worried for a minute there. Can I just… get back to my mail now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. Here you go. And I’ve already made a note for the nurse. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your blood tests, or after you receive the results. We’re here to help. You go ahead and get back to your mail. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure things out. Have a good day, Teretha.
