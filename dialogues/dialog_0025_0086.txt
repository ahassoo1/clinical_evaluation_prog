DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon, Kahrin. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Hi, Doctor. Just the results, please. I don’t really have time for a whole visit, just what the tests showed.
DOCTOR: “Just the results”?
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I know why I was tested, and I’m pretty sure you do too. I just need to know what they say, so I can… move on with things. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s… unusual for someone to dismiss a thorough review of their medical findings, but alright. You were tested for… several things, as you know. Let’s see… your complete blood count was within normal limits. Your metabolic panel was largely unremarkable, though your vitamin D level is quite low. And the… other test… came back positive.
PATIENT: Positive for what exactly? You said “other test.” Don’t leave me hanging, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Positive for Treponema pallidum antibodies, indicating a current or past infection with syphilis, Kahrin. It's a sexually transmitted infection. And frankly, a little more… concern would be appropriate given the seriousness of that. You do understand what that means, don't you?
PATIENT: Syphilis? Seriously? Okay, wow. Um… I mean, yes, I know what syphilis is. But… how? I… I haven't… well, it’s been a while, okay? But I always… used protection. What kind of protection failed? And when would I have… gotten it? Is it recent? I need specifics, Doctor. And how do we fix it?
DOCTOR: “Fix it”?
PATIENT: Well, yes! Treat it! Cure it! Whatever you do when someone tests positive for… that. I need antibiotics, right? I need to know how long it's been, if it's progressed, if I need to tell anyone… Just tell me what the next steps are. And quickly, if you could. I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's not pretend we're having a casual conversation here, Kahrin. A positive result doesn’t automatically mean a current, active infection. It means you’ve been exposed. To determine if this is a recent infection or something from the past, we need to do further testing – a more specific antibody test called an RPR titer, and possibly a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. Those will help us stage the infection. And yes, penicillin is the treatment of choice, but we need to know what we’re treating before we start dispensing antibiotics willy-nilly. As for “telling anyone,” that’s your business, but you do have a responsibility to inform any recent sexual partners so they can get tested. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. More tests. Fine. RPR… and FTA-ABS. Got it. When can I get those done? And is this going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, remember? As for… partners… look, that’s complicated. But I’ll… think about it. Just get me the tests scheduled, please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: The lab here can do both tests. It’s best to do them at different times to avoid false positives. We'll start with the RPR titer today, and then repeat it in two weeks. The FTA-ABS we'll order after we get the RPR results. As for cost… let me see what the cash price is. It's… not cheap. Approximately $150 per test. We can discuss a possible payment plan with the billing office, but frankly, it’s a substantial expense without insurance. Avoiding these issues in the first place would have been far less costly, both financially and… otherwise.
PATIENT: $300? Seriously? Okay. Fine. Payment plan. Whatever it takes. Just… get it done. And can I get a piece of paper with the dates and times of the tests? And the name of the billing office? I don't have time to remember everything. And… is there anything else I need to know right now? Before I leave? I need to be able to… plan.
DOCTOR: Here. The lab hours, test dates, and billing information are all on that sheet. While we wait for the results, I advise you to abstain from sexual activity. And… this is important, Kahrin. Syphilis can have serious long-term complications if left untreated – neurological damage, cardiovascular problems, even death. It’s not something to take lightly, or “plan” around. You need to follow up, get treated, and be responsible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No sex. Follow up. Get treated. Be responsible. Look, I appreciate… the lecture. And the information. Just… is there anything else immediately I need to do? Any symptoms I should be looking for? Any over-the-counter things I should avoid? I just want to be prepared. And then I really need to go. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Early symptoms can be subtle – a painless sore called a chancre, often in the genital area, or a rash that doesn't itch. But many people don’t experience any symptoms at all, which is why regular testing is important. As for over-the-counter things, avoid anything that might mask symptoms. Don’t try to self-treat. And… frankly, I strongly recommend informing any current sexual partners. It’s your ethical responsibility. Now, I have other patients waiting. Please schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as you receive the test results. And… try to take this seriously, Kahrin. This isn't something you can just “plan” around. That will be all for today.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No self-treating. Follow up. And… I'll think about the partners. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I… I need to go now. .
