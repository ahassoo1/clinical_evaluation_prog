DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Long time ago. I hear now you can do… a test? With spit? To find out. I want to know if I still have family… maybe in other islands. I make boats, small ones, but I want to know where the first boats come from, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You’re interested in exploring your ancestry, learning more about your family’s origins, and potentially connecting with relatives. And you’ve heard about genetic ancestry testing, the kind done with a saliva sample. That's perfectly reasonable, and we can certainly discuss that. It's a fascinating field. To clarify, are you primarily interested in learning about your Marshallese heritage, or are you curious about ancestry beyond that as well?
PATIENT: Just… all of it, I think. Mostly Marshallese, of course. My grandfather, he tell stories… about the big canoes, and the stars. But maybe… maybe there was someone else before that? I don't know. I just want to know. It’s okay if it’s just Marshallese, though. That's good enough. It just… feels important now. I’m getting old, you know? Want to tell stories to my grandkids. Real stories.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable feeling, Mr. Scobie. It is important to connect with our roots and preserve those stories for future generations. And it’s wonderful that you want to share that with your grandchildren. These genetic tests can provide a lot of information, but it’s important to understand what they can and can’t tell us. They look at markers in your DNA to estimate your ethnic origins and potentially identify distant relatives. However, they aren't perfect, and the further back you go, the less accurate the information becomes. Before we proceed with ordering a test, let’s talk a bit about your family history as you know it. You mentioned your grandfather’s stories – that’s a great starting point. Do you recall anything specific about where on the Marshall Islands your family is from, or any other islands they may have traveled to?
PATIENT: Hmm… Majuro, I think. Yes, Majuro. That’s where my grandfather was born. And my father too. But he… he worked on the ships. Went to many places. Kwajalein sometimes. And… Jaluit, I think? It’s hard to remember. He never talk much about before Majuro. Just stories of the fishing, and the storms. And how to build a good canoe. He say the canoes tell you where to go. He say… always look at the stars. Never forget the stars. But that’s all I remember about where we come from. I’m sorry. It’s an old head.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Majuro, Kwajalein, and Jaluit are all valuable pieces of information. It’s wonderful that you remember those names. And the stories of the fishing, the storms, and the canoes – those are important parts of your family’s heritage, regardless of where they originated. The stars, especially. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, no test before. This would be first time. I… I don’t really understand how it work. You take spit, and then… what happen? Does it tell you exactly where people come from? Like, can it tell me the name of my great-great-grandfather?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie. It’s important to understand the limitations of the testing. No, it won’t tell you the exact names of your ancestors, especially not going back several generations. It's more about estimating your ethnic origins based on comparisons with populations around the world. Here’s how it generally works. You’ll provide a saliva sample – it’s a very simple process, usually just spitting into a tube. That sample is then sent to a laboratory where they analyze your DNA. They look at specific markers in your DNA and compare them to databases of DNA from people around the world. The results will give you an estimate of your ethnic breakdown – for example, “60% Marshallese, 20% Polynesian, 10% Micronesian, 10% East Asian.” It can also potentially identify distant relatives who have also taken the test. The accuracy of the results depends on the size and diversity of the databases they use. The more people from Marshall Islands and surrounding areas who have taken the test, the more accurate your results will be. It's also important to remember that these are just estimates, and there’s always a margin of error. Would you like me to go over some of the companies that offer these tests?
PATIENT: That… makes sense. Not exact, but a good idea. A starting place. Yes, please. Tell me about the companies. Which one you think is best? I don’t want to spend too much money, but I want to get good information. And… I don’t understand computers very well. Need something easy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. There are a few companies that are popular and generally reliable. AncestryDNA is one of the largest, and they have a very large database, which can be helpful for accuracy. They also offer features to help you build a family tree, which you may find interesting. However, it’s also one of the more expensive options, and requires some computer skills to navigate the website. 23andMe is another popular choice. They provide information on both ancestry and health traits, which may or may not be of interest to you. Their website is relatively user-friendly. The cost is similar to AncestryDNA. MyHeritage DNA is another option, with a good database and a user-friendly interface. They also focus heavily on family tree building. Their prices are often a bit lower than AncestryDNA or 23andMe. For someone who isn’t very comfortable with computers, MyHeritage DNA is probably the easiest to use. They have a very intuitive website and good customer support. And they're often running promotions, so you may be able to get a good deal. All of these companies require you to create an online account and order the test kit through their website. You’ll receive the kit in the mail, collect your saliva sample, and mail it back to the laboratory. The results usually take a few weeks to come back. Would you like me to help you visit the MyHeritage DNA website to see if it looks manageable for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be very helpful. Thank you. I… I don’t even know where to start. I have a computer, but my grandson usually use it. He’s good with those things. But I want to do this myself, if I can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here we are: [https://www.myheritage.com/dna]. You can see it’s pretty straightforward. The big button says "Start Your DNA Discovery." It will ask you to create an account with your email address and a password. Do you want me to help you with that, or would you prefer to do that on your own later?
PATIENT: Oh… so many words. Let's maybe do it later. I think my grandson can help me with the computer part. But thank you for showing me. I think I understand a little bit better now. What about the spit? How much spit do they need? And… is it hard to send it? I don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. No need to rush. It’s good that your grandson can help with the online part. As for the spit, they don't need a lot. Usually, just a couple of teaspoons worth is enough. The kit will come with a special tube, and instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s important to avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes beforehand, just to avoid contaminating the sample. Sending it is very easy. The kit will come with a prepaid mailing label, and you just need to drop it off at any post office. The instructions will explain everything very clearly, and they'll send you an email when they receive the sample. It’s really quite simple, and they're very good about making sure the sample arrives safely. Do you have any other questions about the process at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s okay for now. You explained it very well. I’ll talk to my grandson, and maybe we can order the kit together. Thank you, Doctor. You were very patient with me. I… I feel better now. Knowing I can find out a little bit about where I come from. Even if it's just a small piece of the story.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. It’s a wonderful thing to want to connect with your roots, and I’m happy to support you in that journey. Remember, even a small piece of the story can be very meaningful. If you have any questions at all as you go through the process, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie.
