DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Annesley, you say? A lovely name. Hmm… what does bring me in… now let me see. It’s something about… the blood. Yes, that's right. I need to know… what kind it is, my blood. My family… they wanted me to find out. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nini, understanding your family history is important. So, you’d like to know your blood type?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it exactly! My blood type. Is that what you call it? It's… important for things, I believe. Paperwork, maybe? Or… in case something happens. I just… don't remember why it's so urgent now. It was my daughter, Elena, she was very insistent. A good girl, Elena. Always thinking ahead.
DOCTOR: Right, knowing your blood type is definitely helpful for medical reasons, and sometimes for family history records. We can absolutely get that done for you. Just to be thorough, have you ever had a blood test before?
PATIENT: A blood test… Oh dear. Now that is a question. I’ve had… lots of things done over the years. Working as a rigger, you get banged up a bit, you know. But a specific test just for the blood type… I honestly can’t say. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Maybe when I was a little girl? Or perhaps with the insurance… I have private, you know, but I don't recall any specific tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We'll proceed as if this is your first time having it done. It's a very quick procedure. Just a small sample of blood is all we need. Before we do that, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh, just a little something for my knees, sometimes. The rigger work, you see. Old injuries. I think it’s called… glucosamine? Or something like that. It comes in a little bottle. As for allergies… no, I don't believe so. Nothing comes to mind. I eat everything, practically. Though, I don't think I’ve ever had… durian. Is that a fruit? Elena warned me about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, glucosamine, good to know. And no known allergies, that’s helpful. Durian is a fruit, yes, quite strong-smelling, some people don't like it! Okay, Ms. Nini, to move forward, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that's a big one. My husband, bless his soul, he was very healthy. Spanish, like me. We came here a long time ago. Elena, my daughter, she's doing well, I think. Lives in the city. Grandchildren too, little ones. As for illnesses… hmm. My mother, she had… troubles with her heart, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. I don't recall any specific… hereditary problems, if that's what you mean. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Things get hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Heart issues on your mother’s side. We'll make a note of that. Now, have you been feeling any symptoms lately – anything at all that's been bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Symptoms… no, not really. A bit tired sometimes, but that's just old age, I suppose. Knees ache a little, like I said. And… oh, sometimes I forget things. But who doesn't at my age, eh? Nothing serious, Doctor. Just the usual wear and tear. I'm a sturdy woman, I assure you. Been through a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. It’s good you’re feeling generally well. Just to be thorough, and to get a full picture, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Nothing major, just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Listening to my heart… makes sense. It's been beating a long time, you know. And the knees… well, they’ve seen a lot of action too. Go ahead, please. Don’t mind me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me, Ms. Nini… and another… Good. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, which is common with age, nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me, gently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the knees. There we go. A little stiff, as you can see. They creak a bit, like an old ship. Been climbing rigging since I was a girl, you know. Dangerous work, but I loved it. Elena didn't want me to do it anymore, but… well, I couldn't just stop. It was in my blood, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some crepitus – that’s the creaking you mentioned – and a little bit of swelling, but no significant tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited. It sounds like some osteoarthritis, which is very common with age and previous injury, as you mentioned. Now, let’s check your blood pressure… 140 over 85. A little bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. We can monitor that. Okay, Ms. Nini. Everything seems generally good. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, we'll go ahead and draw some blood to determine your blood type. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood type it is! I’m just glad we’re figuring things out. It's a relief to have someone looking after me. It's… hard to keep track of everything these days. Where do we draw it from, if you don’t mind me asking? Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: It’s not painful, Ms. Nini, just a quick little prick. We’ll draw it from a vein in your arm. If you'll just have a seat here, the phlebotomist will be right with you. It will only take a few minutes. Afterwards, I'll review the results with you and we can discuss any further steps if needed.
PATIENT: Oh, a phlebotomist, you say? Alright. A vein in the arm… yes, that sounds… manageable. I always worry about things like this, you know. Old woman's nerves, I suppose. Elena used to say I was a drama queen. Hopefully it won't take too long. I have a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: "Good afternoon, Maria. Could you please draw a blood sample for Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you, Maria. Elena always said I should be nice to everyone. She was a good girl, that Elena. Is it cold in here, or is it just me? I always feel the cold, you know.
