DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Carmaleta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get right to it, that’d be great. I just want to make sure everything’s… you know… working. Before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Right, “everything’s working.” Okay. Can you tell me a little more specifically what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much is going on. That’s the problem! I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, I’d like to start a family. Before I get any older, obviously. It’s just… things aren't happening, and I don't want to waste time with… problems. I want it to be easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're wanting to explore fertility options, or at least get a baseline assessment to see if there's anything preventing conception. And you’re understandably concerned about time. That's perfectly reasonable. Just to be clear, you’ve been trying to conceive with a partner for… how long?
PATIENT: Trying? Oh, not really trying trying. It’s been… a few months, maybe? Look, it’s complicated. I’ve had… a brief relationship, and it didn't work out. I just assumed it would happen, and it hasn’t. I don’t really keep track of these things, to be honest. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of intermittent attempts. And you haven't been tracking cycles or ovulation?
PATIENT: Tracking? Heavens no! I have a job, you know? I'm a food science technician, I don’t have time to… chart things. Look, is there a test we can do? Something quick? I really don't understand why this is taking so long to get to the point.
DOCTOR: Right, a quick test. We can certainly start with some basic bloodwork to check your hormone levels – things like FSH, LH, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. Those will give us a starting point. It’ll also be helpful to get a general health check, just to rule out anything obvious. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Um… not that I know of. I take a multivitamin, does that count? Honestly, I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me. Is that a test you can do? Like, a full-body thing? Because I’m not getting any younger, and I’d like to know if I need to… explore other options.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're understandably anxious about time. A “full-body thing” is a bit broad, but we can definitely run a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks organ function, electrolytes, things like that. We can also do a complete blood count. Before we order anything, though, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My husband always handled the doctor stuff. I had… something with my gallbladder years ago, but it was taken care of. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. Really, I've always been pretty healthy. I eat well – I work with food, remember? I just… want a baby.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder issue in the past, otherwise generally healthy. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, that was it. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a shipment of samples coming in this afternoon and… honestly, I’m not sure why I need to tell you all this. You’re the doctor! Aren't you supposed to just fix things?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's not quite “fixing” – it’s more like gathering information to understand what might be going on. It helps me make the best recommendations for you. Okay, family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, infertility?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother had… something with her joints, arthritis maybe? Lots of aches and pains, anyway. Really, everyone on my side lives to be quite old, so… I wouldn't say there’s much in the way of serious illness. Look, can we just get to the tests? I’m starting to feel a bit rushed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's order those blood tests - complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and hormone levels as we discussed. We can also do a urine sample just to rule out infection. It's standard procedure. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I wouldn't dream of it. I need a clear head for my work, and I take care of myself. Look, can I schedule the tests now, or are we going to be here all day? Honestly, this is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the requisition for the lab. They’re just down the hall. You can go whenever you're ready. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get it done quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
