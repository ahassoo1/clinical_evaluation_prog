DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… fine. My wife, she made the appointment. Said I've been… well, a bit off lately. Confused, she says. Honestly, I don’t know what she’s talking about half the time, but she worries. Always has. It's these little spells, I guess. Just… blank spots.
DOCTOR: “Blank spots,” you say. Okay. And how long have these spells been happening, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s not like they started suddenly. It’s been… months, I suppose. Maybe six? It’s hard to say. Things blend together, you know, when you get to be my age. It’s not constant, mind you. I still know how to set a tile, perfectly. Best in the county, some say. It’s just… remembering where I put my glasses, or what I went to the store for… little things like that. My wife gets very upset about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds… frustrating for both of you. Six months, you said. And these episodes… do they happen at a particular time of day, or are they random?
PATIENT: Random. Completely random. Could be morning, could be afternoon. Sometimes I’ll be right in the middle of something – like mixing the grout, and just… stop. Stare at the bucket, not knowing what I was doing. It doesn’t last long, usually. A minute, maybe two. Then it just… comes back. Though sometimes I can't recall what I was thinking about before. It's not like I'm falling down or anything. Just… a momentary lapse. Annoying is what it is.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," yes, I can see how that would be. And has anything changed recently, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… not really. My wife and I, we’ve been retired for… oh, fifteen years now? Same routine. Wake up, have coffee, she does her gardening, I work in the garage when I feel up to it. The weather’s been hot, very hot, if that counts for something. And Old Man Hemmings next door, he finally painted his house that awful shade of purple. That's new, I suppose. But nothing… major. Why do you ask? Is this about my memory? Because I know I can still measure a room better than anyone.
DOCTOR: I’m just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Lason. No, I wasn't doubting your tiling skills! It's good to hear you have a consistent routine. The heat... that's something to keep in mind. And the purple house… well, that is striking. Now, besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. My wife says I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? Snappish. Though she’s always saying something about my mood. And… my appetite isn't what it used to be. Don't eat as much as I did before, that’s for sure. And… oh, this might be nothing, but I seem to… stumble more often. Not fall, but just… a little unsteady on my feet. It's probably just my age. Everything’s starting to creak, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Irritability, decreased appetite, and some unsteadiness. Those are all things to consider. Do you have any trouble with your vision, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Vision? Well, I need my glasses, of course. Can't see a thing without them. But with them, it’s… fine. I mean, I can still see straight lines. Important for tiling, you know. Though sometimes things seem… a little blurry around the edges. I just figure it’s the glasses need cleaning. My wife keeps telling me to get a new prescription, but I’m happy with these. They’ve served me well for years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual. A little pill for my blood pressure, that's all. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for the pain. Nothing fancy. Just whatever the doctor prescribed a few years back. I can't remember the names of them now, sorry. My wife keeps track of all that.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll get the names from the record. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that, too. "Any allergies, Colt?" she says. "Any new rashes?" I always tell her, no. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don't need much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Lason. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your general health and see if anything stands out. We'll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to check your reflexes and balance, and maybe take a quick look in your ears. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Anything to get to the bottom of this. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have a bit of work I was hoping to get done in the garage this afternoon. It's a small repair, but it needs doing. And my wife will be upset if I’m gone too long. She worries. Always has.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. We’ll be as quick as possible. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 148 over 88. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes, alright. Fine. Just… don't hit me too hard. I'm an old man, you know. A little tender. Honestly, I don't know what you're looking for. My wife says I’m as strong as an ox, but she exaggerates. Always has. Go ahead. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Just a routine check, Mr. Lason. Alright. And now let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Stand on one leg? Now that’s a trick. Alright, here goes… Woah… steady now… steady… Oh dear. See? I knew it. Terrible balance. Always have been a bit clumsy. My wife says it's because I never paid attention in gym class, but that was a long time ago. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Lason. No need to push yourself. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to take a look in your ears, if you don't mind. Ears appear clear, with some cerumen buildup bilaterally, but no signs of infection. Okay, Mr. Lason, that completes the physical exam for now. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. I'd also like to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Now hold on a minute. A CT scan sounds… serious. Is something wrong? My wife is going to have a fit if I tell her I’m getting a CT scan. What are you looking for? I just have a few little spells, that’s all. Not everything needs a scan, you know. This is getting out of hand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. It does sound serious, and I apologize if it’s alarming. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. The spells, irritability, decreased appetite, balance issues, and slightly elevated blood pressure—they can all be caused by a number of things, and a CT scan will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it’s best to be thorough. We're looking for any evidence of a stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities in the brain. It’s a precautionary measure, Mr. Lason. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the scan in more detail, and I can answer any questions you have. I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously, but we’re also trying to be cautious. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: A stroke? A tumor?! Good heavens. My wife is going to kill me if I tell her this. I just thought it was my age, you know? A little forgetfulness, a little unsteady… not a brain tumor! I don’t even feel sick. Okay… okay, deep breaths. You said it’s precautionary? Just to be safe? And what does it involve? Do they stick needles in your head? Because I don’t like needles. My wife… she'll be beside herself. This is awful.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Lason. And it’s good that you’re asking questions. The scan is not something to panic about. No, they do not stick needles in your head. It’s a non-invasive procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. The machine uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. It's painless, although you will need to lie very still for a few minutes. The scan itself takes about 20-30 minutes, and there are no lasting side effects. We’ll explain the entire process to you before the scan, and a technician will be with you throughout the entire procedure. We’ll discuss the results of the scan with you as soon as they’re available, and we’ll develop a plan based on what we find. For now, let's focus on getting the scan scheduled. We can arrange for your wife to be with you during the procedure if that would make you more comfortable. Would you like me to call her and discuss it with her directly?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, please. Call my wife. Her name is Anya Lason. And… tell her everything. Tell her about the stroke and the tumor and everything. She needs to know. She always knows best, anyway. And… make sure she brings her phone. She likes to Google things. Always has. Just… please, tell her everything. I don't want any surprises. This is all very… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Hello, Mrs. Lason?
