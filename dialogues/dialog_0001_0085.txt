DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this…patch. On my skin. It just appeared, really. Quite bothersome, if you must know. I noticed it about…oh, let me think… the 18th of July, I believe. Yes, definitely the 18th.
DOCTOR: The 18th, alright. And where exactly is this patch?
PATIENT: On my left forearm, naturally. It's…difficult to describe. It’s not raised, thankfully, but it’s…a different shade. Not a pleasant shade, I assure you. It’s a sort of…muddy brown. Not like a sun tan, absolutely not. More like…well, like something has stained it. Though I haven't been doing any gardening, I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: Muddy brown, not raised… okay. And has it changed at all since the 18th?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s…expanded. Not dramatically, mind you, but noticeably. Perhaps…a centimeter? It's quite unsettling, frankly. I keep thinking it will just…go away on its own, but it hasn’t. And my husband keeps telling me I worry too much, which, honestly, is not helpful. He doesn’t understand these things.
DOCTOR: Expanded, about a centimeter… Right. And any itching, burning, pain, or discharge associated with it?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. None of that. Just…the discoloration. It's not uncomfortable, per se, just… unsightly. And I’m rather particular about my appearance, you see. I do try to keep up with things. It’s just…there. And growing. I really do dislike it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look. Please, roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: There you are. As you can see, it's quite…distinct. And really, it didn’t need to happen. I haven't changed anything in my routine. Perhaps it's the water? Though I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's…a discoloration, as you say. Not raised, no inflammation. Doesn’t look particularly concerning, honestly. Have you been using any new soaps, lotions, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Absolutely not. I've been using the same things for years. My grandmother always said consistency is key, and I’ve adhered to that principle religiously. It’s a lavender-scented soap, quite mild. And a simple, unscented lotion. Nothing new. It’s very strange, really. It’s as if it just…materialized. Perhaps it’s some sort of fungal infection? Though I haven't been exposed to anything damp or unsanitary.
DOCTOR: A fungal infection is unlikely, given your description. It's probably just a minor skin irritation. Though, I suppose we could take a look at your medical history. Just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I do have a slight sensitivity to bee stings, though that’s hardly relevant, is it? And I was rather unwell with the flu last winter, but that was months ago. Otherwise, no. Perfectly healthy, generally. I maintain a very sensible diet and get plenty of rest. Allergies? No. Nothing of note. Really, I think it’s just…a nuisance. A very persistent, unsightly nuisance. Perhaps a cream? Would a cream help?
DOCTOR: No significant allergies documented. Flu last winter… alright. A cream might help, but it’s probably not worth the expense for something like this. Honestly, I suspect it will resolve on its own. We can try a mild hydrocortisone cream if you insist, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Hydrocortisone… isn’t that a steroid? I’ve read things about those. I’d rather not put something like that on my skin if it’s not absolutely necessary. It’s just… it’s spreading, you see? Slowly, but it is. And frankly, the idea of it getting larger is rather unsettling. Perhaps a different doctor? Someone with more…experience in dermatology? No offense, of course.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Bartock, I’ve been practicing medicine for seventeen years. This is a minor skin discoloration. A specialist visit is unnecessary, and frankly, a waste of your time and money. We can document it in your chart, and if it continues to spread, then we can consider other options. But right now, it’s probably just a harmless irritation. I’m documenting a 1.5cm, non-raised, brownish discoloration on your left forearm. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I understand that you don’t think it’s serious. But I am concerned. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being dismissed. My husband always says I worry too much, but he isn’t the one with a spreading discoloration on their arm! I suppose I’ll just…wait and see, then. But if it gets any larger, I will be seeking a second opinion. And I expect it to be noted in my chart that I requested one. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Fine. "Patient expressed concern regarding a 1.5cm brownish discoloration on left forearm, requested documentation and potential for second opinion if condition worsens." Happy now?
PATIENT: Yes. That is…adequate. Thank you. Now, is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps a pamphlet on skin discolorations? Or…something? I do like to be informed.
DOCTOR: Look, there's a general skin care pamphlet by the door. Take it or leave it. I have other patients waiting. I'm documenting that I advised general skin care. Is there anything else, truly?
PATIENT: Very well. No, nothing further. Though I still maintain it’s rather unusual. And unsettling. Thank you for your time. I suppose I’ll be going, then. Good day. .
