DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Soodeen, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… short of breath, I guess. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. It’s been… a while now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes… and this has been going on for some time. “Some time” is helpful, but could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… now you’re askin’ a lot. Look, things kinda blur when you get to be my age, alright? Maybe… a few months? Or was it longer? I don’t rightly remember when it started started, just that it’s been botherin’ me more and more lately. It’s just… uncomfortable. And thirsty work, this breathin’ business.
DOCTOR: I understand that it can be difficult to recall exact timelines. A few months is a reasonable starting point. Has anything specific made it worse recently, or is it a gradual increase in discomfort?
PATIENT: Gradual, mostly. But… now that you mention it, the heat’s been terrible lately, hasn't it? Makes it harder, for sure. And I been doin’ a bit of work outside… fixin’ the traffic lights down by the highway. Not a young man anymore, but somebody’s gotta do it, right? They don't hire good help these days. But yeah, heat and… movin’ around, that makes it worse. Still, it’s been happenin’ even when I’m just sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with heat and exertion, but present even at rest. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmmm. Let me see… … Not much, I don’t think. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, but I always figured that was just from bein’ on my feet all day. Old man stuff, you know? Never really paid it much mind. Not like it's botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any chest pain, or palpitations – that is, feeling like your heart is racing or skipping beats?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully. Heart… sometimes it feels like it’s thumpin’ a little harder than usual, maybe. But I get that when I’m nervous, too. And I get nervous plenty these days! Everything’s so… complicated. It ain’t a pain, though. Just… aware of it, if that makes sense. Skip a beat? Can’t say I’ve noticed. I ain’t payin’ that much attention to my insides.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some awareness of your heartbeat, but no chest pain or skipped beats. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Swallowing... No, can still eat my Cuban sandwich just fine, thank you very much. And my voice… well, I always sounded like this. A little rough around the edges. Ain’t gettin’ any smoother, that’s for sure! But no changes, no. Don’t sound like somebody else took over my throat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I ate everything put in front of me as a kid, and I’m still here, aren’t I? Maybe a little sensitive to dust sometimes, but that ain’t an allergy, that’s just… common sense. Never had a bad reaction to any pills the doctor’s given me before. Old doctor Hernandez gave me somethin’ for my arthritis, and that worked alright. But other than that, no. Don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the somethin’ for my arthritis, like I said. Doc Hernandez gave me a prescription, and I keep gettin’ it refilled. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Little white pill, that's all I know. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of them… what do you call ‘em… the nighttime things. Melatonin, that's it! But that ain’t regular, just when I’m really restless. Other than that... no. Not much. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication and melatonin as needed. Now, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical... Hmmm. Well, I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin’ a mango tree. Stupid thing to do, lookin’ back. And… I had some trouble with my blood pressure a while back, doc Hernandez said somethin’ about that, too. He put me on pills for it, but I stopped takin’ ‘em ‘cause they made me feel dizzy. And I got the shingles once, that was no fun at all. Other than that… I think that’s about it. I ain’t been to a doctor much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu, broken arm as a child, history of high blood pressure treated with medication that was discontinued due to dizziness, and shingles. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... … Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young, I think. That's all I can remember. A long time ago, before I even came to this country. Other than that… no. Never been one for cuttin’ things open if I can avoid it. Why mess with somethin’ that’s workin’, right?
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal in the past. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mama, she had… somethin’ with her heart, I think. She died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. My papa, he lived a long life, healthy as a horse, mostly. He smoked cigars all his life, can you believe it? And my sister, she had trouble with her sugar, somethin' about diabetes, I think. Other than that… not much I can recall. They all lived down in Cuba, and we didn’t see each other much. It was a long time ago. Families get scattered, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your sister. Lastly, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… you mean like, do I go to parties? No, not much anymore. I live alone, always have. Never married, never had kids. Worked my whole life, fixin’ traffic lights. Still do, when I can. Used to like fishin’, but haven’t had the time lately. Smoke a little… sometimes. Just a couple of cigars a day, to relax. And drink a little… beer, sometimes. Not much, though. Old man habits, you know? Keeps me goin’. Not much else to tell ya. Quiet life. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your mouth and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds alright, doctor. Do what you gotta do. Just… be gentle, alright? Old bones ain’t what they used to be. And don't take too long, I got things to do. Traffic lights don’t fix themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but it’s regular. I hear some mild crackles in your lungs, mostly in the lower lobes. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit elevated. Now, let me take a look in your mouth and throat. Your mouth is quite dry, and your throat is a little inflamed. No obvious signs of infection, but it’s definitely dry. I'm also feeling some mild swelling in your ankles. I'll document these findings.
PATIENT: Swelling? Ain't never noticed that. Crackles… sounds bad. What does it mean, doctor? Is it somethin' serious? I got work to do, you know. Can't be lyin' around sick. I need to know if I gotta slow down, or what. Just tell me straight, alright? No fancy doctor talk, just what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, I understand your concern. The crackles in your lungs, the dry mouth and throat, and the swelling in your ankles, along with your elevated blood pressure, suggest a few possibilities. The most likely is that you're experiencing some degree of fluid overload, possibly related to early heart failure, or a condition impacting your kidneys. The elevated blood pressure can contribute to this. Your symptoms of shortness of breath and thirst are also consistent with this. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to stop working entirely, but it does mean we need to investigate this further. I want to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a blood test called a BNP, which helps assess whether your heart is under stress. I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We'll also do an EKG to see if there's any heart abnormality. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? X-Ray? Blood tests… sounds like a lot. … Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. But don’t keep me waitin’ too long. And explain what all these tests mean to me, alright? No fancy doctor talk, like I said. Just tell me what's wrong, and what I gotta do about it. And can I still fix traffic lights while I'm waitin’ for the results? That's important, you know. People need those lights.
DOCTOR: I understand. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a quick and painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us detect any irregularities in your heart rhythm. The chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs and heart, allowing us to see if there's any fluid buildup or other abnormalities. And the blood tests will give us information about how well your kidneys are functioning, as well as other important indicators of your overall health. As for fixing traffic lights… I would advise against any strenuous activity until we have the results of these tests. Even light work could potentially worsen your condition. I know it’s important work, but your health is the priority right now. We need to rule out anything serious before you go back to it. I'll get the orders for these tests sent to the lab immediately. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild diuretic to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diuretic? Water pill? … Sounds… serious. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like takin’ pills, but I don't wanna end up lyin' in a hospital bed, neither. So… alright. But if I start feelin' worse, I’m callin' you, alright? And I still need to know when I can get back to work. People are countin’ on me. And how long will these results take, exactly? A couple of days… is that two days? Three? Don't leave me hangin’, doctor. I gotta plan things.
DOCTOR: Yes, a diuretic is a water pill, and it will help your body get rid of some of the excess fluid. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. I understand your concerns about taking medication, and we'll monitor you closely. As for when you can get back to work, I can’t give you a definite answer right now. It will depend on the results of the tests and how you’re feeling. “A couple of days” usually means two to three business days, but it can sometimes take a little longer depending on the lab’s workload. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as the results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. If you start feeling significantly worse – such as experiencing increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or ankles – please call my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Don’t hesitate. I'm also going to give you some written instructions about the medication, including potential side effects. Do you have any questions before I finish this prescription?
PATIENT: Side effects? Everything has side effects. … Well, I guess not right now. Just… make sure they call me as soon as they get those results, alright? And tell 'em to speak slowly. Sometimes I have trouble hearin'. And… what do I gotta do about my blood pressure? Do I gotta take somethin’ for that, too? I stopped takin’ the pills before 'cause they made me dizzy, but maybe a lower dose would work? Just... don't wanna end up fallin' off a ladder, you know? That wouldn't be good.
DOCTOR: I’ve noted in your chart that you experienced dizziness with the previous blood pressure medication. We can certainly try a lower dose once we have the results of the tests and a better understanding of your overall condition. It’s important to get your blood pressure under control, but we’ll do it gradually and carefully. I’ll also ask the nurse to remind them to speak slowly when they call, and to explain everything clearly. They’re used to dealing with patients who have difficulty hearing. For now, focus on resting and following the instructions for the diuretic. Try to avoid strenuous activity, and drink plenty of fluids. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that's all for now. Just… get those results back quickly, alright? And tell 'em to speak slowly. And… thank you, doctor. I appreciate you listenin’ to an old man ramble. … Now, if you’ll excuse me, I gotta go home and lie down. And maybe try to forget about all these tests and pills. It’s a lot for an old man to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guilds. It’s my job to listen. And please, don’t worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. I'll have my nurse call you shortly to schedule a follow-up. Rest well, and take care.
