DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well… it’s about this… team. A tryout. For… sports. I think. It was advertised. Somewhere. I don’t recall exactly which team. They need a… physical, I was told. Before I can… play.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. A pre-participation physical. That makes sense. I see here you're 51 years old. And is that Danny Bartok, B-A-R-T-O-K?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Danny Bartok. Though… I don’t know why you need to spell it. People usually get it right. Fifty-one, yes. Getting old, I suppose. Not that it matters for… this. Whatever this is.
DOCTOR: It’s just standard procedure, Mr. Bartok, to confirm everything. And you’re right, age doesn’t always define what we can do. Now, can you tell me a little more about the sport you're trying out for?
PATIENT: Sport…? Honestly, Doctor, that’s the part I’m fuzzy on. It involved a… ball, I think. And running. Maybe. It was at the community center. A flyer. Lots of young people. I thought, “Why not?” I don't recall any specific name for it. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: It does help me to get a better picture of what kind of physical demands we're talking about, Mr. Bartok. Knowing the sport helps me focus the exam. But we can certainly proceed without it. Have you been experiencing any pain, any injuries, or limitations in your physical activity recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… a little ache here and there, you know? Old age. Nothing serious. My knees sometimes complain when I… stand for too long. And my back. But who doesn’t have back problems? Limitations…? I get tired easier now than I used to, I guess. But that's… normal, right?
DOCTOR: That is normal as we get older, Mr. Bartok. But it’s good you mentioned the knee and back pain, and the fatigue. Let's talk a little more about that. Regarding your knees – can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… dull ache. It’s worse after I've been on my feet for a while. Like after… walking around. Or, you know, being active. It’s not constant. Comes and goes. Sometimes, when I go down stairs, it feels a little… shaky. Not every time, though. It’s hard to explain. It just… feels old.
DOCTOR: Okay, “feels old” is a good way to put it. And it sounds like it's worse with activity and going down stairs. Does it swell, or lock up at all?
PATIENT: Swelling… no. Not that I’ve noticed. And lock up? No. It doesn’t… stick. It just… bothers me. It’s not like I can’t walk. I can still… get around. I haven’t done anything to it, either. No falls. No accidents. It just… started. Slowly. Over time. A little bit worse each year, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. That gives me a good idea. And you mentioned some back pain as well. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Worse when I… bend over. Or lift something. Nothing too heavy, mind you. Just… regular things. Like groceries. Or… helping around the house. It’s not a terrible pain. More of a… stiffness, really. Like I need to… stretch it out. Sometimes it feels a little… pinched. But it goes away after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stiffness and a pinching sensation that improves with stretching. Have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm… I think I pulled something once. A long time ago. When I was… younger. Doing some work. Lifting something heavy. But I didn’t go to the doctor about it. Just… rested it for a few days. And it got better. Nothing serious. I don’t remember the details, really. It was a long time ago. Probably not important now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible past strain that resolved on its own. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Never. High blood pressure… Doctor, I don’t even like going to the doctor. How would I know if I have high blood pressure? Heart problems… no. I’ve always been… pretty healthy. Aside from the knees and back, of course. I have Medicare. They’d tell me if something was wrong, wouldn't they?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask. Medicare would let us know if there were concerns. But it's important to ask as well, because sometimes things develop without immediate notice. Let me check your records. Okay, I see here you have a history of hyperlipidemia - high cholesterol - diagnosed about five years ago. Are you taking any medication for that?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… Oh. That. Yes. The… pills. The little white ones. I take them every day. Doctor… what was her name? She told me to. Something about my numbers. I don't know the name of the pill. I just take what they give me. Every morning. With breakfast. That's all I know. Are those important for… this? The sports thing?
DOCTOR: They could be, yes. It's good to know you're taking medication for your cholesterol. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? Doctor, I just take the pill. Every morning. I don't… measure it. It's a little white pill. Small. That's all I know. I go to the pharmacy. They give me a bottle. I take one every day. I don't… pay attention to numbers. It's all very confusing. Is this important? Will it stop me from playing…? Whatever this sport is?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright, Mr. Bartok. We can figure this out. It’s helpful to know what you’re taking for a complete picture of your health. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean… sometimes I sneeze. But that’s just… dust. Or pollen. Everyone sneezes. I don't think I’m allergic to anything serious. No hives. No trouble breathing. I eat everything. I've never had a problem with food. As far as pills go… the doctor gives me what I need. And I take it. I haven’t had any… reactions. I don’t think so. No allergies. I’m pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… let me think. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. A long time ago. That's it. Maybe. It was so long ago, I barely remember. And… I had a wisdom tooth pulled. But that’s not… surgery, is it? Just… a tooth. No, I haven’t had any real surgeries. Nothing major. Just… the tonsils. A long, long time ago. I was very young.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tonsillectomy as a child. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My family… they weren’t big on doctors. Or talking about… things. My mother… she lived a long life. But she… wasn't very healthy towards the end. Something with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. My father… he worked very hard. He died… a long time ago. I don't recall any specific illnesses. And my siblings… we weren’t very close. We didn’t talk about these things. I’m sorry. I don’t have much information. It wasn’t something we discussed.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bartok. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Okay, let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke…? No. Never. Tried it once, a long time ago. Didn’t like it. Made me cough. Drink…? I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too much. Just… one glass. To relax. And… recreational drugs? Doctor, I’m a respectable man. I don’t… indulge in those things. No. I don’t. Never have. Never will.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Mr. Bartok, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do. But yes. Go ahead. I'm ready, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's check your vital signs. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Though… it might crack. There. Like that. Not very graceful, I know. But that’s my knees. They’re old. Is that what you needed to see? The… cracking?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. I’m noting some crepitus with flexion and extension, which is common with age-related wear and tear. There’s mild tenderness along the medial joint line of both knees. Range of motion is slightly limited. No swelling or instability noted. Okay, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees. It's a common condition, especially as we get older. Your cholesterol is being managed with medication, and you otherwise appear to be in relatively good health. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? That sounds… serious. Will I be able to play…? Whatever this sport is? Is it… contagious? And what about the… cracking? Is that bad? Do I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s address those questions one by one. Osteoarthritis is not contagious. It's a wear-and-tear condition of the joints. Think of it like the tires on a car – over time, they naturally get worn down. It’s not an infection or something you can catch. Regarding playing, it depends on the sport and the level of activity involved. Mild osteoarthritis shouldn't necessarily prevent you from participating, but it's important to be mindful of your knees and avoid activities that cause significant pain. We need to know what the sport is to better evaluate that. The cracking you hear is crepitus, which is the sound of cartilage rubbing together. It’s often harmless, but it can sometimes be associated with pain. As for surgery, it’s definitely not the first line of treatment. We would start with conservative measures like physical therapy, weight management if needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers. Surgery is only considered if those measures aren’t effective. I recommend we start with a course of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. I will also write you a prescription for a mild NSAID, like ibuprofen, to help manage any pain. Do you have any further questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? Sounds complicated. And… expensive. Ibuprofen? I think I’ve got some of that at home. Look, Doctor, to be honest, I just want to know if I can play this sport. Whatever it is. I don't want to spend a lot of money on therapy. And I don't want to take a bunch of pills. What is this sport, anyway? Maybe it’s not even worth it.
DOCTOR: You are right to be practical, Mr. Bartok. Let's try to get to the bottom of this sport. Do you recall anything about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, the flyer... it had a lot of young people on it. Running around. A ball, I think. It was at the community center. On Tuesdays and Thursdays. And… there was a man. A coach, I suppose. He was yelling. Encouraging people. It wasn't… basketball. I think. And it wasn't… football. Too much contact. It was… indoor, I think. That’s about all I can remember. I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is it possible someone at the community center could tell us what it is?
DOCTOR: That's a very good idea, Mr. Bartok. Perhaps calling the community center would give us the information we need. In the meantime, given your knee pain and the potential for activity, I would advise you to proceed with caution. Avoid any strenuous activity until we know more about the sport. If it involves a lot of running, jumping, or twisting, it might not be the best fit. I’m happy to see you back for a follow-up after you find out more. We can discuss your options and develop a plan that's right for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Even if I don't know what this sport is yet. I'll call the community center. And if it's too much… well, I’ll just stay home. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any further questions. Have a good day.
