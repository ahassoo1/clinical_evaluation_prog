DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful, it is. Comes on suddenly, you see. Like someone flipped a switch. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don’t keep up with these things. It's not like I'm a doctor, is it? My Harold always handled things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness that comes on suddenly… and something about numbers from the lab related to your muscles. That gives us a starting point. Just to clarify, do you remember when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… well, after the festival, I suppose. The one down by the river. Harold and I went, you see. Lovely fireworks. But that was… a while ago now, wasn’t it? July, maybe? Or was it June? Honestly, all the months just blur together these days. I just know it wasn't like this before the festival.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started sometime around the festival in June or July. And you weren’t feeling this tired before then. That’s helpful. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My Harold keeps saying I’m more… clumsy lately. Dropping things. Bumping into furniture. Though I always thought he was the one moving things around! And my legs… they ache sometimes, especially after… well, after I’ve been on them, of course. But everyone’s legs ache when they’re old, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Right, clumsiness and leg aches. That’s good information. And it’s true, aches and pains are common as we get older, but we want to figure out why you’re experiencing them. When you say your legs ache, is it a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. Not all the time. Mostly after I've been doing something. Gardening, mostly. I still try to keep up with my roses, you see. But then, later, they just burn. A deep ache. And sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet for too long, they feel… weak. Like I might just topple over. Though I wouldn't actually topple, of course. I'm a sturdy woman, even at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the ache and weakness come on after activity, like gardening. That's useful. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or any unusual rashes?
PATIENT: Rashes? No, not that I’ve seen. My skin is just… old skin, dear. A bit thin, a bit spotty. Harold says I look like a roadmap, which I thought was rather rude! But no, no rashes or anything like that. I do get a bit of sun on my arms when I’m out in the garden, but I always try to wear a hat. You have to be sensible, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, no rashes. Good. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And Harold says I had a touch of the flu once, but I don’t remember much of it. And… and the doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high, so he put me on a little pill for that. I take it every morning. Now, what was Harold saying about… arthritis, was it? He keeps muttering about arthritis. But I don't feel arthritic, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure treated with a pill, and Harold mentioned arthritis. That's all helpful. Do you remember the name of the pill you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. Not a bit. Harold handles all that. He gets it from the chemist, puts it in a little box for me. White box, I think. Small one. I just take it with my breakfast. I wouldn't dream of messing with my medicine, you know. It's important to do as you're told. He'd be terribly upset if I started trying to remember pill names!
DOCTOR: Alright, a white box with your blood pressure medication. We can look that up. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I eat everything Harold puts in front of me, and he's a good cook. Though I did have a bit of a funny feeling after eating those mussels last year… but that might have just been a bad mussel. And pollen… well, I sneeze a bit in the spring, but everyone does, don't they? Not a serious allergy, certainly not enough to bother the doctor about. I'm a pretty robust woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a little sneezing in the spring. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, and strength in your legs. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. If you think it’s necessary. Though I've always been perfectly healthy, you know. Harold says I'm as strong as an ox. But do what you need to do, dear. Just be gentle, won’t you? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be very gentle. Okay, Ardelle, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds good so far. Now, can you flex your ankles and knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Flex… is that like bending them? Ooh, that’s a bit stiff, isn’t it? My knees always ache when it’s cold. And Harold says I don't do enough exercise, which I think is rather rude. I used to be a very active diver, you know. Commercial diving. Very demanding work. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's a little tenderness in your knees, and your reflexes seem a bit diminished. Nothing alarming, but it's helpful information. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hand as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. As hard as I can… Is that enough? It’s not as strong as it used to be, I’ll admit. All these years of gardening, I suppose. And Harold keeps saying I should lift weights, but I haven't got the energy. Honestly, dear, it’s all rather tiring just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That’s good to know. I’m going to order some blood tests, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. These tests will check your vitamin levels, your thyroid function, and also a few things related to your muscles. It will help us rule out any deficiencies or other possible causes for your tiredness and weakness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh dear. I don't like needles, you know. Harold always has to hold my hand when I get them. But if you think it’s necessary… all right. Just be quick about it, won’t you? And tell the young man to be gentle. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure they're as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll write the order now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can help you with exercises to strengthen your legs and improve your balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… hmm. More appointments. Honestly, dear, it’s all a bit much. I just want to feel like myself again. But if you think it will help… all right. As long as they’re not too strenuous. My Harold worries about me overdoing things. He's a good man, you know. Always looking after me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you have someone looking out for you. The physical therapist will work with you at your own pace. We’ll start slowly and build up gradually. Okay, I've finished the referral. The nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule an appointment. So, to summarize, we’re going to do blood tests and a referral to physical therapy. I’ll also look up your blood pressure medication to make sure we have an accurate record of your medications. We’ll call you as soon as the blood test results are back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. It’s just… a lot to take in. Honestly, I just want to be able to get back to my roses. My Harold says I worry too much, and he’s probably right. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. And I understand wanting to get back to your roses. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here's a copy of the referral and the lab request form. Have a good day, and please give Harold my best.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. You too. Thank you again.
