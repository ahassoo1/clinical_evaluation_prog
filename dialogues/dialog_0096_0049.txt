DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it’s me ears, you see. They ain’t what they used to be. Things are gettin’ muffled, like talkin’ underwater, almost. I don’t catch everything folks say, and I hate askin’ ‘em to repeat themselves. It’s awful embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Getting a little hard of hearing, are we?
PATIENT: That’s the ticket, yes. Hard of hearin’. Always been a bit sensitive to loud noises, even when I was workin’ at the shoe factory. All that clatter and bangin’… I reckon it finally caught up with me. Though, I’m not sure when exactly it started getting bad, now that I think about it. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It often does. So, this has been a gradual thing, you're saying?
PATIENT: Gradual… yeah, I think so. Not like a sudden thing, no. Just… less and less clear over time. It's hard to pinpoint, like I said. I mostly notice it when there’s a lot of background noise. Quiet rooms are alright, mostly. Though even then, sometimes words just… float away before I can grab ‘em. My nephew, Billy, he says I’m shoutin’ too much, but I don't feel like I am!
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes people don’t realize how loudly they’re speaking when they’re straining to hear. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. A high-pitched sort of… whine. Not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. Mostly when I’m tired, I think. Or stressed. Though, what isn’t stress these days? It's a little thing, barely noticeable most of the time. I just put it down to… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the muffled hearing and the ringing, have you experienced any dizziness, pain in your ears, or any discharge?
PATIENT: Dizziness… not really. A little unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that's just me gettin' old, I reckon. Pain? No, no pain at all. And discharge… what do you mean, discharge? Like… from my ears? Goodness no, nothing like that! I keep ‘em clean as a whistle, I do. Never had any trouble with that. No, just the mufflin’ and the ringin’, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any significant health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… now that’s a question. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be forty, fifty years now. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that cleared up fine. Mostly, I've just been lucky, I suppose. A few aches and pains here and there, what do you expect at my age? I don’t take a lot of medication, just a little somethin' for me arthritis now and then.
DOCTOR: And what is that "little something" for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? Little white pills. Two of ‘em, twice a day, when me joints are botherin’ me. Sometimes I forget to take ‘em, to be honest. Doesn’t always help much anyway. My sister used to swear by glucosamine, but I never got around to tryin’ it. She’s gone now, bless her soul.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never been one for fancy foods, so I haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything, really. I had a bit of a rash once after I used a new soap, but I just stopped using it. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a bit itchy. No, I don’t think I have any proper allergies. Nope.
DOCTOR: Alright. And who is your pharmacy and do you have any family history of hearing loss?
PATIENT: Pharmacy… let me think. It’s… O’Malley’s, down on Main Street. Big red sign. I’ve been goin’ there for years, ever since old Mr. O’Malley retired. Nice young fella runnin’ it now. And family history… now that’s a tough one. My mother’s side was mostly deaf as a post, come to think of it. A lot of ‘em worked in the factories, like me. Loud noises, you see. So, probably. Yes, I reckon there’s a bit of that in the family, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Schneer, it sounds like you've likely got age-related hearing loss, possibly exacerbated by noise exposure and a family history. Now, let’s have a quick look in your ears. Just going to take a peek, won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds about right, I suppose. All that racket at the factory… I always figured it’d catch up with me eventually. Be gentle now, won’t you? My ears are a bit sensitive. Go ahead then, have a look. Let me know if you see anything… strange.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears, quite a bit actually. The tympanic membranes themselves appear intact, but a little dull. No signs of infection or fluid. This is consistent with age-related changes and wax impaction. It's what I expected, honestly. Now, we can try removing the wax first, which may improve your hearing somewhat. It's a simple procedure. Would you like to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? Well, I always did have a bit of buildup, my mother used to say. She used to poke around with those little cotton swabs, but I never liked it much. Sounds sensible to me, gettin’ rid of the wax. Yes, go ahead then. If it helps me hear a little better, that’d be wonderful. What does it involve, exactly? Just tell me what you’re gonna do, dear, I like to know what’s happenin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s a fairly straightforward procedure. I'll use a small irrigation syringe to gently flush out the earwax with warm water. It might feel a little strange, like a pressure sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'll use a microscope to visualize the ear canal and ensure I'm removing the wax safely. If it's particularly impacted, it may take a few attempts. Now, I need you to let me know immediately if you experience any pain, dizziness, or ringing in your ears during the procedure, understand?
PATIENT: Warm water, is it? Alright, that sounds… manageable. Just a bit strange, you say? Good. And yes, I understand dear. Pain, dizziness, ringin’… I’ll let you know right away. Don’t you worry, I’m not afraid of a little water. Just get on with it then, if you think it’ll help. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ll start with the right ear. Lean your head slightly forward… and relax. This may take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, that is a bit strange, yes. Feels a little… cold. Not painful, just… unexpected. Is it supposed to feel like that? Like water in my brain, almost… It's alright, I'm alright, just a little odd. Keep goin', dear, keep goin'.
DOCTOR: It's normal to feel some pressure and a slightly odd sensation. The water is room temperature, it shouldn't be cold. I'm seeing some wax starting to come out now. Just a little more… Alright, that should do it for the right ear. Let me take a look. Hmm. Much better. The canal is significantly clearer now. We'll repeat the process on the left ear.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Glad to hear it’s gettin’ clearer. Feels… lighter, somehow. Yes, go ahead with the other one then, if you think it’ll help. I'm trustin' you, dear. Just be gentle, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Lean your head slightly forward… and relax. This may take a few minutes. I'm seeing some wax starting to come out now. Just a little more… Alright, that should do it for the left ear. Let me take a look. Hmm. Much better. The canal is significantly clearer now. Alright, Mr. Schneer, both ears are now significantly clearer. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… well now. That is better. Everything sounds… brighter. Not quite as muffled, certainly. It's hard to explain… like a veil has been lifted, a little bit. I can hear you clearer, that's for sure. Still not perfect, mind you, but a definite improvement. Thank you, dear, thank you very much. That was… well, a good job.
DOCTOR: Good. It sounds like the wax impaction was contributing significantly to your hearing loss. Now, I recommend a hearing test to assess the extent of any underlying hearing loss and determine if you would benefit from hearing aids. Would you like me to schedule one for you?
PATIENT: A hearing test, is it? Well, if you think it's a good idea… yes, go ahead and schedule one then. I suppose it can't hurt to know for sure, can it? If I need hearin' aids, well, then so be it. I'm gettin' too old to ignore these things anymore. When would that be, dear? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled you for a hearing test with the audiologist, Mr. Henderson, next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. It should take about an hour. They're located just down the hall, room 203. He’ll be able to give you a comprehensive assessment and discuss your options if hearing aids are needed. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten, is it? Room 203… yes, I think I can remember that. Thank you, dear. That's very helpful. No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything. Just one thing… will I need to bring anything with me for the test?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to bring anything. Just yourself. And if you have any family member you'd like to accompany you, that’s fine too. They can help you understand the results. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, dear. You've been a great help. I feel much better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. I’ll see you next Tuesday then. Good day to you. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Schneer. And remember to follow up with Mr. Henderson next Tuesday. .
