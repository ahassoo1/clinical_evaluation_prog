DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to feel that way, Ms. Dudney. High blood pressure often doesn’t present with noticeable symptoms, which is why it's sometimes called the “silent killer.” However, even without symptoms, it’s important to address, as it can lead to serious health problems over time. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first found out your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Honestly? I think it was at that health fair last month. Some volunteer stuck a cuff on my arm and started rattling off numbers. I didn’t really pay attention, to be honest. My husband, Dale, made me come. He worries too much. Said the numbers were “high.” I just figured the machine was broken or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like this was a relatively recent discovery. And it’s good Dale encouraged you to get checked. Sometimes those health fair readings can be a little inconsistent, but it’s still a good idea to follow up. Just to confirm, has anyone—a doctor, another healthcare professional—specifically told you that you have high blood pressure before this health fair reading?
PATIENT: No. Never. I go to the doctor for my yearly check-up, and everything’s always fine. I don’t understand why everyone is making such a big deal about this now. It’s probably just stress. Dale's been wanting to retire for years, and it’s causing a lot of tension.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Dudney. Stress can certainly play a role in blood pressure fluctuations, and it's good you've identified that as a potential factor. However, we still need to investigate further to determine the underlying cause and the best course of action. To get a more complete picture, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions—anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I’ve been lucky. Always healthy. My mother lived to be ninety-two, and she never had a day’s illness in her life. Good genes, I guess. I eat pretty well, mostly. Dale does most of the cooking, and he’s very careful with salt. He worries about that, too. Honestly, it feels like everyone’s just looking for something to be wrong with me.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about your mother’s health, and it sounds like you’ve been very proactive about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It's good you and Dale are mindful of salt intake. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that's it. Just a cast for six weeks. Nothing serious. I’ve always been careful. I don’t go around doing foolish things. Honestly, I think this whole blood pressure thing is a waste of my time. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. It’s never pleasant to feel like your time is being taken up by something you don’t think is necessary. However, even if you’re feeling perfectly healthy, addressing potential health concerns is important. Now, let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking – including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements.
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Every morning. Dale makes sure of it. He’s always reading articles about how important vitamins are. Other than that, nothing. I don’t believe in taking a lot of pills. They just cause more problems than they solve. I’m a perfectly healthy person, Doctor. I really don’t understand why we’re spending so much time on this.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Dudney. It’s good to know you’re only taking a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. None. I can eat anything, take anything. I've never had a reaction to anything in my life. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're just trying to find something wrong with me. I have a deadline to meet, Doctor. Can we just wrap this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize if it feels like I’m pressing you unnecessarily. I assure you, I'm simply trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you want to know? I work. I come home. I eat dinner with Dale. Sometimes we watch TV. It's a pretty normal life. I don't smoke, I barely drink, and I try to get enough sleep when I can. It's not like I'm out partying every night or anything. Honestly, I just want to go back to work. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you lead a very healthy and balanced life, Ms. Dudney. That's excellent. Just to clarify, when you say you "barely drink," approximately how often do you consume alcohol, and how much at a time?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know… maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month? Sometimes Dale and I will have a beer while we’re watching a football game. But that’s it. I’m not a big drinker. Honestly, I’m starting to feel insulted. Are you accusing me of something? I’m a civil engineering technician. I design things. I don’t sit around drinking all day. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please don’t feel insulted, Ms. Dudney. I’m not accusing you of anything at all. I’m simply asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health and lifestyle. It’s standard practice, and it helps me understand any potential factors that might be contributing to your elevated blood pressure. Now, could you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: What about my work? It's... work. I design drainage systems for new construction projects. I spend most of my day at a desk, looking at blueprints and running calculations. It’s not physically demanding, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, I’m a perfectly healthy person. I just don’t understand why we’re going through all of this. Can we just get this over with? I have a deadline, Doctor. A real deadline.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize for taking up your time. It sounds like your work is primarily sedentary. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I want to ask one last question. Do you experience any stress at work or in your personal life?
PATIENT: Stress? Is that even a question? I’m a civil engineer! There’s always stress! Deadlines, difficult clients, budget cuts… It’s a stressful job! And Dale’s been talking about retiring for years, and we just can’t seem to agree on when the time is right. It's… a lot. Honestly, I just want to go back to work and get things done. Can we please just be done here? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Dudney. It sounds like you’re dealing with a significant amount of stress, both at work and in your personal life. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in those situations. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and determine if there are any underlying issues contributing to your elevated blood pressure. It will involve checking your heart rate, listening to your lungs, and taking your blood pressure again. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. My blood pressure is probably fine. It always is. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, let’s start with your heart rate. It’s currently 72 beats per minute, which is within a normal range. Your lung sounds are clear, and I don’t detect any wheezing or crackling. Now, blood pressure in your right arm is 148 over 92. And in your left arm, it’s 146 over 90. Your pulse is regular and strong. I’m listening to your carotid arteries now, and I don’t detect any bruits. I'm checking your extremities for any swelling. I don't observe any edema. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. I've documented my findings. While your heart rate is normal, your blood pressure is elevated on both arms. This confirms the readings the nurse took earlier.
PATIENT: Elevated? It's probably just because I'm stressed being here. Honestly, I'm not surprised. I told you. Can we please just be done? I need to go back to work. What's the next step? Do I need pills? Because I'm telling you now, I don't want them.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudney. It's common to feel anxious during medical appointments, and that can certainly contribute to a temporary elevation in blood pressure. However, consistently elevated blood pressure, even with stress factored in, requires further investigation. Before we discuss medication, I want to order some additional tests to help determine the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure. These tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a urine analysis. These tests will help me rule out any other potential medical conditions that could be contributing to your high blood pressure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm a perfectly healthy person. I don't need a bunch of tests. But... fine. Whatever. Just get it over with so I can go back to work. What do I have to do? Do I have to come back? Because I really don't have time for this. I need a written excuse for work, too. And I want it now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. I assure you, these tests are a standard part of evaluating high blood pressure and will help me provide you with the best possible care. I’ll write an order for the lab tests now. You can go to the lab located just down the hall. They’re open until 5 PM today. You don’t need an appointment. It should take about an hour to complete all the tests. Here’s the lab order. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. And here’s a written excuse for your work, stating you were seen for a medical evaluation and require follow-up care. It indicates you may need to miss additional time for lab results and potential further appointments. I also want to emphasize that while we wait for the test results, I recommend making some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your stress levels, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. Do you have any questions about the tests, the follow-up appointment, or the lifestyle modifications?
PATIENT: No. I don't have any questions. Just get me out of here. Honestly, I can't believe all the time I'm wasting on this. I have a deadline. A real deadline. Thank you. I'll... I'll go do the tests. Just send me the results when they're ready. And don't bother calling me unless it's absolutely necessary. I'm busy. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. We’ll be in touch with the results as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. .
