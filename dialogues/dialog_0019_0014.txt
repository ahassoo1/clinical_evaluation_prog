DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm... let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… papers? For work? I’m Directors, you know, with the church… religious activities and education. Something about needing to be off… for a bit. I get a little… foggy sometimes, you see. I think it has to do with… well, things. I just need the paperwork, I guess. For FMLA or… disability? She mentioned those.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you might be needing some medical documentation related to potentially taking time off from your work with the church. Let's try to clarify things a bit. When you say “foggy,” could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain, Doctor. Just… things aren't as clear as they used to be. I forget names, sometimes what I was just doing… little things. It's not all the time, mind you. But enough that my wife worries. And I… well, it’s harder to focus, I suppose. It’s been… gradual, over the last year or so. It doesn’t hurt, or anything. Just… gone. Like a wisp of smoke. Does that make any sense? I apologize, I’m not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your memory and concentration. It's perfectly alright to not be able to explain it perfectly – that’s what I’m here for. And it’s good that your wife is noticing and supporting you. Let’s go through some things to get a better picture. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. I used to sleep like a log, you know? But lately… I wake up a few times during the night. Nothing major. Just… aware. Like I'm drifting, and then I’m awake for a little bit, then back to sleep. It doesn’t keep me up for hours, thankfully. Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes at a time? And I don’t always remember why I woke up. Just… awake. My wife says I sometimes talk in my sleep, but I don’t recall any of it. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, Mr. Limtiaco. Waking up during the night and not remembering why, along with any talking in your sleep, are both things we want to consider. Now, thinking about your daily activities, have you noticed any difficulty with things like cooking, managing finances, or taking your medications, if you take any?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure, but my wife handles all of that, bless her heart. She keeps everything organized. As for cooking… I used to enjoy it, but I haven't been doing much lately. I get… distracted easily. I might start making something, then forget what I was doing halfway through. It’s easier if my wife does it. Finances… she handles all of that too. I trust her implicitly, you see. I used to help, but… I'm not as sharp as I once was. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but… it’s the truth. I worry about being a burden, sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you’ve got a wonderful support system with your wife, and it’s very common for things to change as we get older. We’re just trying to understand what’s going on, and you’re doing a great job sharing this with me. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with a… a procedure. A stent, I think they called it. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, mumps… but nothing lasting. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Until… well, until recently. I can't remember if I've been formally diagnosed with anything else, truthfully. My wife keeps track of all of that. She's got a file somewhere, I'm sure. Would she be able to bring it next time?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Limtiaco. Having your wife bring in any medical records she has would be very helpful. And don't worry about remembering everything – that's what the records are for. Now, let's talk about your family. Has anyone in your family experienced similar memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer's or dementia?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she got very confused towards the end of her life. They didn't really talk about it much back then. Just said she was “getting old.” But she… she didn’t recognize me sometimes. It was very sad. My father, he was always sharp as a tack. Never had any trouble remembering things. I don’t know if it was just… her. My wife might know more about that. She’s very good with family history. It was a long time ago, you see, and my memory… well, you know. It's all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s understandable, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like there may be some family history of memory problems, and it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not me. Never been much of a drinker. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. And smoking? Heavens, no! My father smoked, and it nearly killed him. I swore off it when I was a boy. And recreational drugs? Never touched them. I'm a church man, you see. I believe in living a clean life. I spend my time with my wife, and with my congregation. That’s enough for me. A quiet life, mostly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a simple neurological exam to assess your memory, balance, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I sometimes forget instructions, you see. Just… take it slow, if you would. And if I get confused, please don't hesitate to stop and explain things again. My wife will be able to fill in the gaps, I'm sure. I apologize for being a bit… scattered. It's not usually like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Just relax, and I’ll guide you through everything. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing to be overly concerned about at this point, but it’s something we should monitor. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, let's do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ready. Though, I must warn you, my memory isn't what it used to be. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. Please repeat the three words I just said.
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Apple… I remember apple. And… something with a 'T'… table? Yes, I think table. And… oh dear. Something small… round… was it… penny? I think it was penny. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right? I apologize if I missed one. It's right on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: That was very good, Mr. Limtiaco. You remembered two out of three correctly. That's a reasonable result, but we'll revisit that later. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your orientation. Do you know what the date is today?
PATIENT: The date…? Oh dear. Let me see… is it…? August…? Yes, I think it's August. But the day…? I apologize, Doctor. I’m terrible with dates. Is it the… second? Or the third? I really can't say for sure. My wife handles all of those details. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Don't worry about it. We're just gathering information. And finally, do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where… where are we? Oh, this is… a doctor’s office, isn’t it? Your office, Doctor. I remember that much. This is… a clinic, somewhere… rural, I think my wife said. But the name…? Oh dear. I’m afraid I don’t recall the name of the clinic. I apologize. It’s all a bit… hazy. I’m so sorry for being so forgetful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. You've been very honest with me, and that's what's most important. Based on our conversation and the examination, you're experiencing some cognitive changes – specifically with memory and orientation – that warrant further investigation. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. I also recommend a neurological consultation with a specialist, Dr. Anya Sharma, who can perform a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work and a specialist… yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. If my wife could bring those records next time, would that be helpful? And… what about the paperwork? For my job? The FMLA or disability… the thing I came in for? Will this help with that? I apologize for being so confused. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, your wife bringing in those records would be very helpful. And yes, this will definitely help with the paperwork for your leave of absence. I can document my findings here, and provide a letter outlining your cognitive changes and the need for further evaluation. That should be sufficient for FMLA or disability applications. I’ll have the nurse schedule the blood work for you, and we’ll get a referral sent to Dr. Sharma’s office. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any stressful activities and relying on your wife for support. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you. And thank you for understanding. I appreciate your help. Just… let me know if there’s anything I need to do. Or if my wife needs to bring anything else. I just… want to get this sorted out. It's been worrying me, you see. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’ll get this sorted out together. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your blood work and go over some discharge instructions with you. Have a good day, Mr. Limtiaco. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
