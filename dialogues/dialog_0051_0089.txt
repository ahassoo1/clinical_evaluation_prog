DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kyron Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? Well, it’s these pains, you see. Lower abdominal pains. They’ve been… troubling. I believe that’s the correct word. I do apologize, my memory isn't what it once was. Something about… a condition I have? Lupus, perhaps? It's been quite a while since a doctor explained it all to me.
DOCTOR: Lower abdominal pain, yes. And you suspect it might be related to a history of Lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Lupus. The pains aren’t… constant, you understand. They come and go. But when they do come… well, they’re quite severe. It feels like… a cramping, a twisting. And sometimes, a sort of… ache that just settles in. It makes it difficult to… to get about, naturally. Do you… do you need me to be more specific? I’m afraid I struggle with details, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Alese. You're doing just fine. "Cramping, twisting, and a settling ache" gives me a good starting point. When did these pains start becoming more frequent, or more severe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. Time… it slips away, you know? Let me think… I believe it’s been… a few months now? Perhaps since the spring? It's hard to pinpoint. They were… manageable at first. Just a little discomfort. But they’ve gotten progressively worse, especially in the last month or so. I find myself… avoiding certain activities. Things I used to enjoy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months, progressively worsening, impacting your activities. Do you notice anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… well, lying down does seem to help. Just resting, taking the pressure off. And… warm baths. A nice, warm bath is quite soothing. As for what makes it worse… moving about, certainly. Anything strenuous. And… I believe eating a large meal can aggravate it. Though, truthfully, I haven't been keeping very close track. It’s all a bit… muddled, you see.
DOCTOR: Lying down and warm baths help, activity and large meals worsen it. That’s helpful to know. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… well, I've been feeling rather fatigued lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And… a bit of swelling in my ankles, I think. It comes and goes, like the pain. And… my skin, I believe it’s been a little more sensitive to the sun. I’ve been trying to stay out of it, naturally. But it’s hard to say if that’s new, or just… the usual. I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Alese. Fatigue, ankle swelling, increased sun sensitivity... all potentially relevant. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. You mentioned Lupus earlier. Are you currently under the care of a rheumatologist for that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Rheumatologist… yes, I was. Years ago. Dr. Abernathy, I believe his name was. But… I haven’t seen him in quite some time. It must be… oh, dear, I'm losing track again… perhaps five or six years? I stopped going for regular check-ups, to be honest. I felt… relatively well. And then, these pains started. I suppose I should have resumed care sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay, last seen a rheumatologist five or six years ago. It's good you're addressing it now. Besides Lupus, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was… quite a recovery, as I recall. And… I do have a touch of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. A small pill each day. Nothing serious. And… I think that’s all. My memory is truly failing me, Doctor. It's rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, well-controlled hypertension. That's helpful. And don't worry about the memory; we'll get through this. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a good question. It’s a small, white pill, I believe. I take it every morning. Let me see… I have a pill organizer, perhaps that will help. Ah, yes. Lisinopril. 10 milligrams. Every morning.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think carefully. I believe I had a reaction to penicillin many years ago. A rash, as I recall. Nothing severe, but… unpleasant. And I'm not particularly fond of shellfish, but that’s more of a… dislike, rather than an allergy, you understand. I wouldn't say I'm allergic, exactly.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy, noted. And a dislike of shellfish. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Family history… That’s… a bit difficult. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, as I recall. He passed away when I was quite young. And… my sister, she has diabetes, but other than that… I'm afraid I don’t have much information. We weren’t a particularly close family, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your sister. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, dear. Well, I’m retired. I used to be a ship engineer, but I’ve been retired for quite some time now. I live alone. And… I don’t really have any close friends or family nearby. I enjoy reading and gardening, when I have the energy. And… that’s about it, I suppose. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: A quiet life, yes. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And… absolutely not any recreational drugs. I've always been a very… sensible person.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese, thank you for providing me with such a comprehensive history. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen to assess the pain. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I do apologize again for being so… forgetful. I hope my rambling hasn't been too much of a hindrance.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Alese. It’s my job to piece things together. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm hearing a regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or extra sounds. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender. I notice some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight fullness. No obvious masses. I'm going to check your ankles for swelling. I note mild pitting edema bilaterally in your ankles. 1+ pitting edema. Overall, your abdomen is tender to palpation in the left lower quadrant, and you have mild swelling in your ankles.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn't sound very good, does it? The tenderness… yes, that’s where I feel the pain most acutely. And the swelling… I hadn’t even noticed it, to be honest. I suppose I’ve just been trying to ignore things. What do you think is going on, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Alese. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam findings – the tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side, and the swelling in your ankles – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of Lupus, a flare-up is certainly something we should investigate. The abdominal pain could be related to inflammation in the intestinal tract, or potentially other organs in that area. The swelling in your ankles could also be a symptom of Lupus activity, or related to other conditions like kidney problems, which can sometimes occur with Lupus. However, we need to rule out other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and some inflammatory markers to check for Lupus activity. I also recommend a urinalysis to look for any signs of kidney problems. Additionally, depending on the blood work results, we may need to consider imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or CT scan of your abdomen, to rule out other causes of your pain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… quite thorough. Blood work, a urinalysis, and possibly… scans? It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But… yes, I suppose it’s necessary. If it will help determine what’s going on, then I’m willing to do whatever you recommend. The Lupus… it always seems to be lurking, doesn’t it? It’s just… tiring, constantly worrying about it. But yes, please. Order whatever tests you think are necessary. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your fatigue, Alese. It's tiring to live with the uncertainty of Lupus. We’ll get through this together. The blood work and urinalysis should be processed within a few days – typically 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. If the initial results suggest the need for further investigation, we can discuss the possibility of imaging studies at that time. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. You can also continue to manage your pain with over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as long as you don’t have any contraindications. If your pain worsens significantly, or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Rest, over-the-counter pain relievers… and wait for the results. I suppose there’s nothing else I can do for now. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for being so… understanding. It’s been a while since a doctor treated me with such kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. It's my pleasure. Remember, I'm here to help in any way I can. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's a copy of the lab requisition and instructions for the urine sample. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available, to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. For now, focus on resting and taking care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
