DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I was hoping to get some paperwork sorted out, regarding… well, planning for the future, I suppose. My solicitor suggested I speak with a physician about an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. Honestly, I don’t entirely recall the specifics, but it has to do with… what happens if I’m unable to make decisions for myself. It feels rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. An Advance Directive... yes. Solicitors often recommend that. It is a sensible precaution, though, frankly, most people don’t give it much thought until it’s too late. It's good you're being proactive. So, you're not experiencing any specific illness currently that prompted this?
PATIENT: No, no illness at all, Doctor. It's… it's more a general concern. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’ve been thinking about… ensuring my wishes are known, should something unforeseen happen. I just want to be prepared. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but it’s been on my mind quite a lot lately. I don't even recall why my solicitor specifically brought it up, only that she felt it was important.
DOCTOR: Well, “ensuring your wishes are known” is admirable, certainly. Though, frankly, a solicitor suggesting medical paperwork based on… vague memory concerns is a bit much. Still. We can certainly discuss it. You said your memory isn’t what it used to be. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to pinpoint. Not large events, precisely. More… details. Names, dates… the specifics of conversations. It’s like… a film with missing scenes. I know I was at a particular event, or did speak with someone, but recalling what happened, or what was said… it's often… hazy. It doesn’t happen all the time, and it hasn’t worsened significantly recently, but it’s enough to make me feel… uneasy. I hope that clarifies things, Doctor. It’s a frustrating experience to describe.
DOCTOR: "Hazy" details… yes. It's remarkably common as people age, though 35 is… somewhat young for significant cognitive decline. Still, we shouldn't dismiss your concerns. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate?
PATIENT: I… I hadn’t considered my age being a factor, Doctor. Concentration… it’s… variable. Some days I’m perfectly focused on my work – the etching requires a great deal of precision, you see – and others… my mind wanders more easily. It’s not a constant issue, but I find myself having to reread things more often than I used to, or double-check my work. It’s a subtle difference, perhaps, but noticeable. I'm unsure if that is helpful.
DOCTOR: “Etching," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm an etcher and engraver. It’s… a rather solitary profession, requiring a great deal of patience and attention to detail. I create designs on metal plates, often for bespoke commissions. It’s… fulfilling work, when I can focus. Is that relevant to the… the paperwork we were discussing? I apologize if I’m being unclear or rambling.
DOCTOR: Well, the nature of your profession might explain some of your… focus issues. Highly detailed work can be mentally taxing. However, we still need to rule out anything more serious. Do you experience any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… not regularly, Doctor. Occasionally, yes, but they’re typically tension headaches – the sort one gets from concentrating for long periods, or being… stressed. Nothing debilitating, and they respond well to over-the-counter remedies. I wouldn’t say they’re frequent enough to be a concern, but… I suppose it depends on your definition of “concern.” Would you like me to keep a log of them, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A log is... unnecessary at this stage. Have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… I’ve noticed I need to hold things a little further away to read them clearly, particularly in dim light. I assumed it was simply a need for new glasses, and I have an appointment scheduled with my optician next month. It’s not a sudden change, and it hasn’t significantly impacted my work, but… yes, I believe my vision has deteriorated slightly over the past year. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Deteriorating vision and… hazy memory. It’s becoming increasingly clear this requires further investigation. I'm going to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Buoniconti, just a series of simple questions and tasks. Then, I'd like to order a complete blood panel and an MRI to rule out any underlying neurological issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… Doctor, is that truly necessary? It sounds… rather invasive. I was hoping to simply complete the paperwork, to ensure my wishes are known. I hadn’t anticipated… such extensive testing. Are you suggesting there’s something seriously wrong? I… I don’t feel unwell, beyond the occasional headache and the… the forgetfulness. Is there a less… drastic option? I'm starting to feel quite anxious.
DOCTOR: "Drastic?
PATIENT: Perhaps that was… an overstatement, Doctor. But an MRI… it seems a rather extreme measure for a few… minor concerns. I understand you’re being thorough, but I’m a little apprehensive, to be frank. Could we perhaps start with the blood panel? And then… reassess the need for the MRI? I’m simply not comfortable with it at this stage. I would like to understand why it’s necessary before proceeding. Perhaps if you could explain the potential causes you’re ruling out, it would alleviate some of my anxiety.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. A blood panel we can do. But understand, delaying a proper neurological assessment could be… detrimental. We are looking for signs of vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, early-stage dementia, even… rarer conditions. But fine. Blood panel first. I’ll order the tests now. And I’ll have the nurse come in to take your vitals. Then, we can discuss the Advance Directive after we have the results. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. Thank you. I appreciate you accommodating my concerns. I understand the importance of a thorough assessment, and I trust your judgment. When should I expect to hear back with the results? And… will the nurse be taking blood here, or will I need to go elsewhere? I apologize for all the questions; I’m simply… a little anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: The nurse will draw the blood here. It should be sent to the lab within the hour. Results typically take 3-5 business days. I'll have my assistant contact you directly when they are available. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
