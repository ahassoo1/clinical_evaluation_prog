DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything feels… slow, you know? I just feel… not so good. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing some abdominal discomfort and a decreased appetite, and generally feeling unwell. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this “big” feeling in your tummy?
PATIENT: Oh, it's alright, dear. Big… well, it's just… puffy, I guess. Like I ate too much, but I haven't! It's hard to explain. It doesn't hurt, exactly… just… there. And full. Even when it’s empty. Do you understand? It’s been like this for… oh, I don’t know. A little while now, I think. Maybe a week? Two? Time… it goes so fast these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're feeling a sense of fullness and bloating in your abdomen, even when you haven't eaten much, and it's been going on for about a week or two. Alright. And has anything in particular made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. I don't think so… not that I can remember. Maybe… when I lie down it feels a little better? But not much. And… no, nothing makes it worse, really. It’s just… always there. Like a full balloon, but not painful. Does that make sense? I used to be able to eat a good plate of potatoes, but now… just a little bit is enough. Or none at all. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. McConnon. It sounds like lying down provides a little relief, but it’s a consistent feeling regardless. And you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you been experiencing any changes in your bowel habits – things like constipation, diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Changes… Well… everything is… slower now, dear. Everything. Going to the bathroom… it’s not as easy as it used to be. Constipation, you say? Yes… maybe a little. But nothing… dramatic. And blood? No, no blood. Definitely not. I would remember that. Everything is just… slower, like I said. It’s just part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It sounds like you’ve noticed some slowing of your bowel movements. And no blood in your stool, which is good. It’s true, changes can happen with age, but it’s important to investigate to make sure everything is alright. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a good question. Well… my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I haven't been weighing myself. I used to be quite proud of my cooking, but I don’t… have much of an appetite these days. So maybe I haven't gained any weight either. It’s hard to say. I just… don’t feel as strong as I used to. Is that what you mean? I just eat a little something when I feel up to it. Not like the good old days… not like when I was making meals for my… oh.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It sounds like you’ve noticed some clothes feeling looser, and you haven’t been weighing yourself. It’s alright if you’re not sure. We can get an accurate weight here today. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… medical conditions? Let me think… Well, I used to have a bad back, but that was a long time ago. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me a pill for that. I don’t take it anymore though… it made me feel… funny. Other than that… no, not that I remember. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, a very long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? Just eat good food, get a little sunshine. But everything feels… slow now. Like my memory, too.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. You had a history of back pain and were briefly on medication for high blood pressure, but you're not currently taking any medications. And you haven’t been to the doctor in quite some time. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, my… surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago! And… I think I was in the hospital once when I broke my arm, falling off a tree. But that was… oh, goodness, many years ago. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I always tried to avoid doctors, if I could help it. They always poked and prodded!
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. You had your tonsils removed as a child and were hospitalized once for a broken arm. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness… family history? That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, I think. But I don’t remember her having any… special illnesses. My father… he was a strong man, but he worked very hard. I don’t… really remember much about their health, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about such things much. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in many years. She lives far away. Does that help? I wish I could be more helpful, dear. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s understandable that you don’t remember a lot of details. Any information you can provide is helpful. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. I eat most everything, although I don’t eat as much these days. I used to love making pies… apple, cherry, blueberry… all kinds! But I haven’t baked in a long time. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, dear. Never have been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McConnon. No known allergies. Alright. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s alright. Do what you need to do. I trust you. It’s just… everything feels so slow these days. My body, my mind… everything. But do what you need to do. Just be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Your heart sounds regular, though a little quiet. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but it does feel a little full. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a lot of information. Slightly elevated, you say? And swelling… in my ankles? I haven’t noticed that. My ankles… I wear slippers most of the time. Everything feels so… slow, like I said. Is it something serious, dear?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’re getting a baseline, Ms. McConnon. The slightly elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling are things we need to investigate further. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's anything serious, but it's important to rule out any potential problems. Given your symptoms of abdominal fullness, decreased appetite, and the findings on the exam, I’d like to order a few lab tests. I want to check a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to rule out any thyroid problems. We’ll also do a urine analysis to check for infection. I’m also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that sounds like a lot of tests. Tests… and an ultrasound? What are you looking for, dear? Is it something bad? I just want to feel better. My tummy… it just feels so full all the time. And I don’t have much of an appetite. Is it… is it serious? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. McConnon. It does sound like a lot, and I understand your concern. We’re just trying to gather information to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. The tests will help us rule out different possibilities. The blood tests will give us a good overview of your overall health. The ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to see your abdominal organs. We are checking to see if there's anything obvious causing the fullness, such as an enlarged liver, gallbladder problems, or kidney issues. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's important to investigate. The symptoms you’re describing, along with the exam findings, warrant further evaluation. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions until we have the results of the tests. We'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, that does sound a little better. Tests… and an ultrasound. Alright, dear. Do what you need to do. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything to me, okay? I don't remember things as well as I used to. When do I need to come back? And where will I go for the ultrasound? I live alone, you know. I need to make arrangements. Everything feels… slow and complicated these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. McConnon. I’ll explain everything to you every step of the way, and we’ll go at your pace. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule you for the lab tests tomorrow morning. She’ll also arrange the ultrasound for you next week, most likely on Wednesday. The ultrasound facility is located just across the street, at 123 Main Street. They’re very good there, and Sarah will provide you with detailed instructions. If you have any trouble getting there, or if you need someone to accompany you, please let Sarah know, and we can help arrange transportation. I want you to feel comfortable and supported throughout this process. Before you leave, I’m going to write you a prescription for a stool softener to help with the constipation. And I’ll also give you a list of foods that are easy to digest, in case you’re having trouble eating. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… very kind of you, dear. A stool softener… and a list of easy-to-digest foods. That would be helpful. Sarah will schedule everything… and help with transportation if I need it? You’re very thoughtful. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming sometimes. It's nice to know someone is helping. Wednesday for the ultrasound… I'll try to remember. Thank you, dear. Thank you very much. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. We’re here to help. Sarah will contact you to confirm the appointments and answer any questions you may have. Here’s the list of foods and the prescription for the stool softener. Please take it as directed. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your appointments. For now, just focus on getting some rest and staying hydrated. And remember, we’re taking it one step at a time. I think that’s all for today. Is there anything else I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, dear. Thank you. You’ve been very kind and helpful. It’s nice to have someone explain everything so clearly. I worry so much. Everything feels so slow… and complicated. I’ll try to remember everything. And I’ll call Sarah to schedule the appointments. Thank you again, dear. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Goodbye, Ms. McConnon. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
