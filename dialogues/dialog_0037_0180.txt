DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Cantorán. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like I want to, you understand? It just… happens. It's been worse lately, that's why I'm here. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good place to start. "Tired" and… a compulsion to eat dirt, worsening recently. I appreciate you being direct. When you say “tired,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? What do you mean describe? Tired is… you’re tired! Like, all the time. Even when I sleep, which isn’t enough anymore, I wake up tired. I just… have no energy. And it's not like I've been doing anything to be tired. I mostly sit at the computer. It's just… gone. My get-up-and-go just got up and went, okay? Does that make sense? I don't understand why you need me to explain tired.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Cantorán. I apologize if my questions seem… detailed. Sometimes, “tired” can mean different things to different people – physical exhaustion, trouble concentrating, feeling generally unwell. You’re right, it is frustrating to have to explain something so basic. So, let’s try this. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the least tired you’ve ever felt and 10 being the most exhausted, where would you rate your tiredness right now?
PATIENT: Ugh, a scale now? Honestly. Look, numbers... I never was good with numbers. Is there a way to just... say it? I'm… I dunno. Probably an 8. Maybe a 9 on a bad day. It's bad. Really bad. And it’s been getting worse for… months, I guess. I lost track. Time just… blurs.
DOCTOR: An 8 or 9, worsening over months... Okay. And you mentioned the dirt eating. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It's... embarrassing, okay? Like I said, it just... happens. I'll be working, and then... I just need it. Not like a craving for chocolate or something, it’s... a need. It’s the earth, you know? Like... clay. Sometimes the garden soil. Doesn't matter, really. I just... pick it up and eat it. It feels... better for a minute. Then it goes away, and I need more. It’s stupid, I know. My husband... he used to make fun of me for it. Not anymore, obviously.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound stupid, Ms. Cantorán. It sounds like something is going on, and you're understandably concerned. Many things can cause unusual cravings, and it's good you’re talking about it. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A long time. Before… before everything, really. Maybe… twenty years? I don't know! It was never this bad before, though. Just… occasionally. I’d feel a little weak, and then it would happen. Now it's… almost daily. And I eat more each time. It's… I’m worried something's wrong. But I don’t even know what to ask. It's just… dirt.
DOCTOR: Twenty years, occasional to almost daily, increasing amount… Okay. It’s good you're recognizing the change. We will figure this out, Ms. Cantorán. Before we get into possible causes, let’s take a broader look. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the… soil ingestion?
PATIENT: Soil ingestion? You mean… eating dirt. Just say eating dirt. And… other symptoms? Let me think. I guess… I've been more… forgetful, maybe? Not like big things, but little things. Like where I put my glasses. Or what I was doing five minutes ago. And my stomach… it hasn’t been great. A little… upset, sometimes. And I get… I don’t know… cranky? My neighbor said I've been snapping at everyone. She’s always listening, that one.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, stomach upset, and increased irritability. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cantorán. It all helps. Do you have any pain with the stomach upset?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More… just… queasy? Like I might throw up, but I never do. And… sometimes constipated. I don’t talk about this with just anyone, you know. It’s embarrassing! It's not like it's a glamorous problem.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Cantorán. These things aren't always glamorous, and you’ve come to the right place to talk about them. We are just trying to gather information. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, now we get to that part? Honestly, Doctor, my memory is awful. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me something about pills, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And… that’s about it, I think. I haven't been to a doctor in years. Not since… well, never mind. It's just… a waste of time, usually. They never find anything.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, discontinued medication due to side effects. We'll make a note of that. We will run some tests and see if we can determine the cause of these symptoms. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in all that stuff, mostly. My husband… he liked those fancy vitamins, but… I didn’t bother after he was gone. Just… extra money down the drain. And I can barely remember to drink enough water, let alone take pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t had any big reactions to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes if I get bitten by a mosquito. But that's it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting tired just answering all these questions. Can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantorán. I apologize for the length of the questioning. We are almost finished with this part. Let’s talk briefly about your family history. Do any of your close relatives have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family? What good will that do? My mother... she had something with her heart, I think. Died young. And my father... he just worked all the time. Didn’t have time for anything. I don't really know much about their medical history. We weren’t close, okay? It’s not like we sat around talking about our illnesses. It's a waste of time. Let's just skip that part. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can skip that part, Ms. Cantorán. Before we move on to a physical exam, I want to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, good lord, no! Not me. I don’t do any of that. Never have. Never will. I spend my days at the computer. That’s it. I just want to be left alone. What does any of this have to do with eating dirt, anyway?
DOCTOR: It all helps to build a complete picture, Ms. Cantorán. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick examination of your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. Just… don't poke too much. And don't tell me I need to start exercising. I hate exercising. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds a bit shallow. Your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch in the lower quadrants. No masses felt. Overall, your abdomen is soft. I'm going to order some blood work to check for iron deficiency, vitamin levels, and your thyroid function. We’ll also do a stool sample to rule out any parasites or infections that could be contributing to the soil ingestion.
PATIENT: Parasites? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Just… give me a paper and tell me where to go to get this stuff done. I want to be finished with this as quickly as possible. And, please, Doctor, don’t expect me to come back for a follow-up. I have better things to do. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantorán. Here's the lab form. You can go to any of the locations listed on the brochure. The results should be available in about a week. I’ll have my assistant call you with the findings. While I respect your wishes, I would strongly recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. It's important to address these symptoms. However, I will respect your decision either way. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Ms. Cantorán. .
