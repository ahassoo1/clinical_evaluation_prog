DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s this… flushing. It happens on my face, mostly. And sometimes my neck. It’s been going on for a little while now. Not every day, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing. And you say it's mostly on your face and neck. How long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three months now? It started small, I thought it was just being warm, you know? But it keeps happening, even when it’s not hot. Maybe two, three times a week. Sometimes more if I… if I get upset about something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months. And it seems to be triggered by stress, at least sometimes. Can you describe the flushing itself?
PATIENT: It’s… warm. Like a hot wave, going across my skin. And my face gets very red. Not just a little pink, very red. And sometimes… sometimes it feels itchy. Not always, but when it’s bad, it does. It doesn’t last long, maybe five, ten minutes. Then it goes away. But it’s… embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome. And it's good you're paying attention to it. Besides the stress, do you notice anything else that seems to bring it on?
PATIENT: Let me think… food? Maybe. Sometimes after I eat spicy food. Not every time, but… sometimes. And… I had a cup of tea yesterday afternoon, a strong black tea, and it happened after that. I don’t usually drink tea, so I’m not sure if that was it. Nothing else I can think of, really. Oh! And sometimes after I shower, but that could just be the hot water, right?
DOCTOR: That's helpful. Spicy foods and tea are worth noting. And you're right, the hot water from the shower is a likely explanation sometimes. Do you have any other symptoms when this flushing happens?
PATIENT: No, not really. No headaches. No dizziness. No… fast heart, or anything. Just the warm feeling, the red face, and sometimes a little itch. And… I feel a little flustered, I guess. But that’s probably just because I’m worried about it!
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms besides feeling flustered, which is understandable. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was… I was married for a long time, my wife… she passed away a few years back. But before that, we were both pretty healthy. I had the usual colds, flu, things like that. No big problems. No diabetes, no heart trouble. Nothing like that. I don't take any medicine regularly, either.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. My condolences. It's good to know you haven't had any major medical issues in the past. And you’re not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes. A multi-vitamin, just to be safe. But I haven't taken one in a while, honestly. I forget. I used to take it with breakfast, but… things slip your mind, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine. My wife always said I had an iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My wife’s family, they had some heart trouble. Her father… he had a bad heart. My side… my father was from India, and we didn’t see him much. I don’t really know much about his side of the family, to be honest. I think… maybe high blood pressure? Someone had that, but I’m not sure who. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble on your wife's side and possibly high blood pressure in your family. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, as I said. Quiet life. I used to work as a counselor, helping people with… well, with problems. Now I’m retired. I mostly stay home, read, watch TV. I try to walk a little bit, but… not as much as I should. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Not a lot of junk food.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired counselor, quiet life, reasonable diet, and some walking. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Never smoked, never drank much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is normal. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I don't see any rashes or unusual markings. Your skin feels warm to the touch. No noticeable swelling. Everything seems within normal limits so far, but we’ll need to consider further testing to determine the cause of your flushing.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… sensible. What kind of tests are you thinking about, Doctor? And… will they be painful? I don’t like needles much, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, and we'll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. I'm considering a few blood tests to rule out certain conditions. A complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or inflammation, and a thyroid panel to see if your thyroid is functioning properly. We might also check for something called rosacea, which can cause facial flushing. The blood draw itself is quick, usually just a few vials, and there's a slight pinch. The important thing is to get to the bottom of this, and these tests will give us valuable information. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests. I guess it’s better to know, right? Yes, I’m… I’m comfortable with that. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: That’s right, it's always best to know. For these tests, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. So, no food or drinks after midnight tonight. You can still drink water. We'll draw the blood first thing in the morning. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab, and they’ll take care of the rest. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Eight hours of fasting… I can manage that. Water is okay, right? Just water. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Yes, just water is fine. And you're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help. It's important to remember that flushing can have many causes, and we'll work together to find the right answer for you. Here's the form. The lab is located at [address]. Please let me know if you have any trouble getting there. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once the results are in. In the meantime, if your flushing gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ll remember the emergency room part. Thank you again, Doctor. And… tell your nurse I'll be expecting a call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. You have a good day as well. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
