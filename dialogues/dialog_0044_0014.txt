DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure’s all mine, I think. Hmm… what did bring me in? Oh, yes. It’s about… paperwork. Something to do with time off, maybe? My wife, bless her heart, she said I needed something from the doctor. FMLA, was it? Or… disability? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. She handles most of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. It’s very common for things like FMLA or disability paperwork to require a doctor’s visit. We can definitely sort that out. Just to be clear, is your wife suggesting you take time off work because of a specific health concern?
PATIENT: Health concern… Well, I've been… not quite myself lately. Tired, mostly. And a little… shaky. Nothing dramatic, you understand. Just… older than usual, maybe? I’ve been working at the church for a long time, you see. Directors, Religious Activities and Education, that’s me. Keeps a man busy. But lately… even that feels like a lot. I don’t know if that counts as a health concern, though. Honestly, I’m not sure what counts anymore.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as a health concern if it’s affecting your ability to do your usual activities, Mr. Limtiaco. Tiredness and shakiness can be signs of many different things, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. I still go to work, I still… direct. But it takes… more effort. And at the end of the day, I just… collapse. Used to be I’d have energy left for the garden, or to visit friends. Now? I just sit. And my wife… she worries. She says I look… faded. Which, I suppose, is fair. It’s just… a general weariness. It’s been creeping up for a few months now, I think. Maybe six months? Time gets away from me. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco, not rambling at all. Six months of gradually increasing tiredness is definitely something we need to investigate. And the fact that it’s impacting your usual activities is important. You mentioned shakiness as well. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the shakiness. It’s not constant, you see. It’s more… when I’m trying to do something precise. Like, if I'm writing a note, or… fastening a button. Small things. It’s not a violent shake, nothing like that. Just… a little wobble. My wife noticed it first, when I was trying to arrange the flowers for Sunday service. She said I nearly dropped the whole vase! Again, it comes and goes. Some days I don’t notice it at all. Is that… concerning? I don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re noticing it and that your wife is observant. Any new tremor warrants investigation, even if it’s mild and intermittent. It’s not about making a fuss, Mr. Limtiaco, it’s about figuring out what’s going on and making sure you’re feeling your best. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm… my appetite isn't what it used to be, I suppose. I don't really crave anything anymore. And I… I’ve been a little forgetful, if I'm honest. Nothing major, just… misplacing things, forgetting names occasionally. But I'm an old man, Doctor. Maybe that's just… age. I wouldn't say it's worrying, more… inconvenient. My wife keeps finding my glasses… everywhere. And she reminds me of people's names constantly. Bless her heart. I’m not sure if that's new, though. It feels like I've been a bit scattered for a while. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. A decreased appetite and increased forgetfulness, along with the tiredness and shakiness, give us a more complete picture. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. We'll want to rule out a few different possibilities. Before we move on, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, dear. That's… a personal question, isn't it? Well… they're a little… irregular, I suppose. Not terribly so. Sometimes a bit loose, sometimes a bit… firm. Nothing that would send me rushing to the hospital, you understand. It's just… not as predictable as it used to be. I blame the fruit, probably. My wife insists on giving me lots of fruit. Healthy, she says. Is that… relevant? I don't usually talk about these things with doctors.
DOCTOR: It is a personal question, Mr. Limtiaco, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable. It’s relevant because changes in bowel habits can sometimes be associated with the symptoms you’re experiencing. And you're right to mention it. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been… managed, I think. My wife handles the medication. And I had my prostate checked regularly for a while, but the doctor said it was fine. Nothing serious, thankfully. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I’ve never smoked, and I only drink socially. Mostly just a glass of wine with dinner now and then. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? This is all rather… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take it one step at a time. Managed blood pressure is good to know. And it's helpful to hear about your lifestyle habits. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm… let me think. No major surgeries, no. I did spend a night in the hospital once, a long time ago, when I broke my arm as a boy. Just a simple fracture, playing football with the other kids. And I had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I try to stay active, even if I don't feel up to it sometimes. I'm just… getting old, Doctor. Is that what this is? Just the inevitable march of time? I feel like I'm rambling again. Apologies.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. And while getting older is a factor, it doesn’t necessarily explain all of your symptoms. It's good to know about the tonsillectomy and the broken arm. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tricky one. My parents… they both lived long lives, thankfully. My mother died peacefully in her sleep, I think. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but it wasn’t anything dramatic. And I had an aunt, on my wife’s side, who had… something with her memory, I think. Dementia, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. Honestly, I don’t know much about it. My family wasn’t one for talking about these things. We just… dealt with it. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very useful. Apologies.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history openly. Knowing about your father’s heart trouble and your aunt’s memory issues is a good starting point. Finally, let’s talk about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, yes. The blood pressure medication, of course. My wife keeps track of it. I think it’s called… Lisinopril? Something like that. And sometimes I take a little something for my knees, when they’re acting up. Ibuprofen, I think. Just over-the-counter stuff. And my wife gives me a multivitamin every day. She says it’s good for my health. As for allergies… not that I know of. Never had any problems with food or anything. I’ve always been fairly lucky, all things considered. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Limtiaco, that’s a very thorough overview. Lisinopril, Ibuprofen, and a multivitamin – good to know. And no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don’t mind. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And… try to be quick, if possible? My wife is expecting me back for lunch. She makes a lovely tuna salad. But please, do whatever you need to do. I want to figure out what’s going on, so I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, everything seems within normal limits, but the slightly elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the unsteady gait warrant further investigation. The tiredness, shakiness, and memory issues are also concerning. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an EKG? That sounds… serious. But yes, yes, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I want to figure out what’s going on. I don’t want to be a burden to my wife. She’s already doing so much. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And what does an EKG involve? Will it be painful? I’m not good with needles, you see. And will it take long? I have responsibilities at the church. I promised to help with the Sunday service preparations. I just… I want to know what’s going on, so I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel concerned, Mr. Limtiaco, but these are routine tests that will help us get a clearer picture of your health. The blood tests will check for common things like anemia, thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and vitamin deficiencies. It’s just a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. As for the needle, it’s a quick pinch, and most people don’t find it terribly painful. It takes just a few minutes. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll attach some small, sticky patches to your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t involve any needles, and it’s completely painless. It takes about ten minutes. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your usual activities, but if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG for you now. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor. Blood tests and an EKG. I suppose I have no choice. Chest pain, shortness of breath… that sounds frightening. But yes, go ahead. Draw the blood, schedule the EKG. Just… try to be quick, if possible? And please, tell my wife everything. She worries so much. She'll want to know all the details. What about the FMLA or disability paperwork? Can we still work on that? I need to be able to take some time off, if necessary. I just… I want to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I will make sure your wife is fully informed of all the results and we can certainly discuss the FMLA or disability paperwork once we have a better understanding of your condition. I will also provide you with documentation for your employer, if needed. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw the blood now. She’ll explain the process in detail. Once the EKG is scheduled, she'll give you all the necessary information. And don’t worry, we'll take it one step at a time. We’ll figure out what’s going on and get you back to feeling your best. Nurse Emily, could you please come in and draw Mr. Limtiaco’s blood and schedule an EKG for him?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I appreciate your help. Just… please, tell my wife everything. She'll want to know. And… try to be quick, if possible? I have responsibilities, you see. I have a church to run. But thank you. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll do our best to get everything done as quickly and efficiently as possible, and I will make sure your wife is fully informed. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
