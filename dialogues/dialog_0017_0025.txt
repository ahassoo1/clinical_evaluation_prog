DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Dr. Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Laury Scobie, that's me. I... I want to know more about where I come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do a test, with spit, to find out?
DOCTOR: A “test with spit”?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That's what my nephew, Joe, he told me. He said it's DNA… something. Finds out where your ancestors come from. He did it, and he found out all sorts of things. I want to know about my side, you know? From the islands. Long, long ago.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, while I appreciate your… enthusiasm, this is a medical clinic, not a genealogical service. We address health concerns here. Ancestry testing is… well, it's not precisely within the scope of family medicine. It’s often unreliable and provides information of questionable clinical value. However, I see from your chart you are Marshallese, and reside in a rural area. Do you have any current health concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Oh. I didn't know. Joe said doctors do it now... for fun, almost. I just want to know... where my family really came from. Before the islands. But... no, no big problems. Just getting old, I guess. A little tired sometimes. And my knees... they ache when the weather changes. Is that what you want to know? Health problems?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, "what I want to know" is what is medically relevant. Aches and fatigue are exceedingly vague complaints. We need specifics. Let's start with the knees. How long have they been aching?
PATIENT: Oh. Right, right. Specifics. It’s been... a long time. Years, I think. Since before I moved here. Maybe five years? Longer? It comes and goes. Bad when it rains, or when it gets really cold. Not so bad in the summer. It's just... old knees, I thought.
DOCTOR: "Just old knees" is not a diagnosis, Mr. Scobie. Do you experience any swelling, redness, or warmth in the knees?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Not that I can see. Redness… sometimes a little bit, when they really ache. But not always. Warm... maybe a little warmer than usual, but hard to tell. It’s just…pain. A dull ache, mostly. Sometimes a sharp pain if I try to walk too far.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Just… tired. You know? Not like I'm sick, just… no energy. I used to make boats, little wooden boats, all by hand. Haven’t done that in a while. Too tired. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe not as good as before. But I'm old, Doctor. Old people get tired.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand you attribute these symptoms to age, but it is my responsibility to investigate potential underlying causes. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… I forget things. Small things. Where I put my glasses. What I was going to say. But… I'm old! Everyone forgets things. It's not… serious, is it?
DOCTOR: “Not serious” is not a medical assessment, Mr. Scobie. And memory changes, even those attributed to age, warrant investigation. Now, are these memory lapses recent, or have they been occurring for some time?
PATIENT: For some time. Maybe a year, two years. Like I said, small things. I still remember how to make boats, and I know my own name! But... sometimes I look at someone, and I can't remember their name right away. Or I go into a room, and forget why I went there. It's frustrating, but... I try not to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. Given your age, and these reports of fatigue and memory lapses, I’d like to run some basic blood work to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. We'll also check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure. This isn't a genealogical assessment, but a basic health screening. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… that's okay. If that’s what you think is best. I don't like needles much, but… I want to make sure I’m not too broken. And… maybe after, you could tell me if there’s anyone around here who does that DNA thing? For finding out where you come from?
DOCTOR: We can discuss potential resources for ancestry testing after we review your blood work results. However, I make no recommendations. Now, let's proceed with the examination. Please follow me. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood pressure first, you say? Alright.
DOCTOR: 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and lie back on the table. Lungs clear. Heart rhythm regular, though slightly brisk. No murmurs noted. Now, can you tell me if you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any. Food, medicine… nothing bothers me. I eat most things. Mostly fish and rice, these days. I used to like fruit, but it's not the same as the fruit from the islands, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they really hurt. It's… I don’t remember the name. A white pill. Joe gives it to me when I call him. He's a good nephew. It helps a little, but not much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, it is imperative that I know the name of any medication you are taking. “A white pill” is insufficient information. Do you recall anything else about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It's small... a little round pill. And it says... maybe something with an "M" on it? Or a "W"? I can't be sure. Joe got it from the pharmacy. He said it was for pain. He's very careful with me. But I forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: This is unacceptable, Mr. Scobie. An unknown medication presents a significant risk. I will have my nurse contact your nephew, Joe, for the precise name and dosage. Now, before we proceed, do you have any family history of heart disease, stroke, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh. My family... Long time ago, on the islands… People just… got old. Sick, sometimes. Died. Not much doctoring, you see. My mother, she was strong. Lived a long life. My father… I don’t remember much about him. He died when I was young. No one talked about heart trouble or… dementia, like you say. Just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Let’s proceed with the blood work. We’ll need to rule out any underlying factors contributing to your fatigue and memory lapses. I'll send the order to the lab now. Please refrain from any strenuous activity until we’ve reviewed the results. And please encourage your nephew to provide a comprehensive list of your medications. This is for your own safety, Mr. Scobie. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Yes, I will tell Joe. Yes, very important. Spit test… maybe after the blood work.
