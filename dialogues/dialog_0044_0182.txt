DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need a sign-off for a little…procedure. My daughter insisted I come get checked out first. Says I'm too old to be making these decisions on my own. Honestly, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand you're feeling a bit rushed, and that your daughter would like you to get a check-up before this procedure. That’s very thoughtful of her, and I’m happy to help put her mind at ease – and yours, of course. Could you tell me a little bit about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: It's a facelift. Is that alright? I don't see what the big deal is. My skin is just…sagging. It's not like I'm getting anything major done. And frankly, I’ve been in better shape. Spent my whole life working with terrazzo, you know. Keeps a man strong. Though these old bones aren’t what they used to be. Still. A facelift. That's all. Now, can we just get this over with so I can schedule it?
DOCTOR: A facelift, alright. And you’ve been working with terrazzo for a long time – that is physically demanding work. It's good you've stayed active. Just to be thorough, and to make sure everything is optimal before proceeding, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Medical history? Really? I’m eighty-one, Doctor, not a newborn. I've had the usual colds, a touch of the flu now and then. Broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder – terrazzo work, naturally. Nothing serious. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I've always been a healthy man. My wife, God rest her soul, always said so. Honestly, I think this is a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, and I do appreciate you telling me that. It's helpful to know you’ve generally been in good health. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. What do you think I am, some sort of fragile old man? I told you, terrazzo work keeps you in shape. I’ve never needed surgery. Had a few stitches here and there, cuts and scrapes, but nothing requiring a hospital. Really, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Are you questioning my fitness for this procedure? Because I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Orwin. I'm not questioning your decision-making at all. It’s simply standard procedure to gather a complete medical history before any elective surgery, even a facelift. It’s about ensuring your safety and minimizing any potential risks. No need to get defensive. Let's just quickly run through your family history then. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any major health problems – heart disease, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My mother died of… something. Old age, I think. My father, he just… wore out. Worked on a farm his whole life. No fancy diseases, just…old age. My sister, she had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing exciting. Look, I’m telling you, we're wasting time. My daughter will be furious if I'm late getting this scheduled. Can we please just get to the physical exam? I'm perfectly healthy. I can feel it in my bones.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your impatience. Let’s proceed with a physical exam then. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. None. Not a one. I've never been allergic to anything in my life. Though I do avoid licorice. Gives me a stomach ache. But that’s not an allergy. Just…discomfort. Now, can we please get on with it? I haven’t got all day, Doctor. My daughter is expecting an update. This is truly a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. No licorice, noted. Let’s get started then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, good and strong. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Not dramatically high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat… Everything looks clear. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon at your age. Finally, let’s take a quick look at your skin. Skin has some loss of elasticity, as expected, and a few age spots. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good shape for your age, Mr. Orwin.
PATIENT: Good. I told you. Now, are we finished? Can I finally get this scheduled? My daughter is going to have a fit if I don't call her soon. She's a worrier, that one. Honestly, I don't know why she insists on all this fuss. I've lived a long life, and I'm still perfectly capable of making my own decisions. So, yes or no? Can I schedule the facelift?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on the exam, you are generally healthy, however, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Before we proceed with the facelift, I would like to have you follow up with your primary care physician to get that checked out and potentially managed. It’s standard practice to ensure optimal health before undergoing any surgical procedure. I understand your daughter is concerned, and I agree that having a stable blood pressure is important for a smooth recovery. It’s not that I’m preventing you from having the procedure, but simply wanting to minimize any potential risks. Would you be willing to schedule an appointment with your doctor before we move forward?
PATIENT: Ugh. Of course. Just what I needed. Another appointment. Look, Doctor, I haven't seen a doctor in years. I feel fine. But fine, fine. I’ll call my daughter. She’ll insist anyway. But don’t expect any miracles. I’m telling you, this is ridiculous. Just…give me the number for a good cardiologist nearby, just to appease her. And then, after I get the all-clear from them, can we finally get this scheduled? I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here. Now, are we done? Really, truly done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I appreciate your willingness to follow up. Here's a card with the information for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-regarded cardiologist just a few miles from here. She’s very thorough and will be able to assess your blood pressure and provide a plan if needed. Once you have her clearance, please call the clinic to schedule the facelift with my office. And yes, Mr. Orwin, we are now truly done. I’ll make a note in your chart regarding the cardiology referral. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…get me out of here. Honestly, the whole thing is a waste of time. But fine. I’ll call Dr. Vance. Tell my daughter I’m doing it, and she’ll be happy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a perfectly good afternoon to salvage. Thank you. Or…not. .
