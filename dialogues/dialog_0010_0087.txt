DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details. It’s…routine, right? I just need to get it done if you could.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, I see here you're scheduled for some routine blood work as part of your annual check-up. And it is routine. No need to worry. Just to be thorough, though, can you tell me if anything specific prompted the scheduling of these tests?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. No, not that I recall. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I think it was just… time? The usual thing when you get to be my age. I’m not feeling unwell or anything, if that’s what you mean. Just trying to keep up with things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're being proactive about your health. Alright, well, let's go over a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure everything is up-to-date before we proceed with the blood work. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of. Never had any trouble with anything, really. Maybe a bit of a sniffle with dust sometimes, but that's it. I don’t take any regular medications either. Just… getting old, Doctor. It comes with a lot of little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or current medications. That's good to know. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago. I think I had… the flu, many years back. And maybe a broken arm when I was a boy. Nothing… serious, not like a hospital stay or anything. I worked at the power plant for a long time, and thankfully stayed healthy enough to keep working. It was a good job.
DOCTOR: Alright, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. I haven’t really kept track. My parents, they’re both gone now. I had a brother, but we lost touch a long time ago. I don’t know much about their health, honestly. We didn’t talk about those things much. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. We work with what we have. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never liked it. Always thought it smelled awful. The power plant had enough bad smells already. Didn’t need to add to it. And no, I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of juice now and then. Can we get this over with soon? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Just a few more quick questions, and then we’ll get right to the blood work. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight… Not really. I’ve always been… this size. Maybe a little less, now that I'm older, but nothing drastic. I eat… well, I try to eat. Not much of an appetite these days, if I’m honest. It’s just getting old, Doctor. Everything slows down. Let’s just get the tests done, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, let’s proceed with the blood work. We’ll just need to draw a few vials of blood. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of that. She’s very good. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about that you'd like me to keep in mind while reviewing the results?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… make sure everything’s okay, I suppose. I don’t want any surprises. Just routine, you said? Then let's make it quick. I really need to get going. .
DOCTOR: Yes, routine. And we’ll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Croonquist.
