DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don't mind. I'm pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see here you came in last week for some bloodwork and a check-up. Let's go over those results. Just to confirm, that was because of some fatigue and, if I recall correctly, some trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Fatigue mostly, and yeah, sleeping has been… off. Not terrible, just not good. Is something wrong? Can you just tell me what it is?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your thyroid levels came back slightly elevated. Specifically, your TSH is a bit low, and your free T4 is a little high. Now, this could indicate hyperthyroidism – an overactive thyroid. But it's not always definitive, and other things can cause these results. Have you noticed any weight loss, increased heart rate, or feeling overly warm or anxious lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Weight loss, no. Heart rate… I haven’t really checked. I get a little anxious sometimes, but everyone does, right? I don't know if that's more than usual. What does this mean though? Do I need medication?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you haven't noticed significant weight loss. Anxiety alone isn’t necessarily indicative, but we need to investigate further. It's too early to say definitively if you need medication. We need to rule out other causes and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a full thyroid panel, including T3, and also check your antibody levels – that will help us determine if this is an autoimmune issue like Graves’ disease. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… complicated. But okay, if that's what you think is best. Will this take long? And how much is all this going to cost? I don't have insurance, so… I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me see… a full thyroid panel with antibody testing will be around $250 to $300, depending on the lab. We can discuss payment options with the billing department after the tests are ordered. As for how long it will take… the results typically come back in 3-5 business days. While we wait, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can we do that now?
PATIENT: Okay, $300… alright. Yeah, fine, let's just get it over with. Physical exam sounds good. The quicker we can figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your heart rate and blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and feel your thyroid gland. Nothing too extensive, just a basic check.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… hurry it up, please? I really do have a lot going on today.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 122/78, pulse is 72. That's within normal limits. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to palpate your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but no nodules are palpable. Is there any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… weird. Like I’m always aware of my throat now, I guess. It’s probably nothing. Look, can we just order the tests and be done with it? I appreciate you checking, but honestly, I’m just trying to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the full thyroid panel and antibody testing. You'll receive a call from the lab to schedule an appointment to get your blood drawn. They should be calling within 24-48 hours. We'll discuss the results once they come back. In the meantime, if you experience any rapid heartbeat, significant weight loss, or severe anxiety, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Just… get it done quickly, please. Thanks. I think that's everything, right? I really need to go. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. The lab will contact you directly. Here's a copy of the lab order for your records. Thank you for coming in, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
