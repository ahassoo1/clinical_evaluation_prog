DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, good morning! Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn't been feeling its best lately either. You know, I’ve had heart trouble for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart concerns. I appreciate you letting me know about both. Let’s start with the cough. How long have you had it, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe six weeks ago? A little over six, I think. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent lately. Worse at night, mostly. Makes it hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Six weeks, consistently lately, worse at night… okay. And is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Oh, it is bringing something up. Yes. It’s… sort of clear, sometimes a little bit white. Not much, though, not like a bad cold. It's just… there. And it feels tickly, like something's stuck back there. Sometimes it makes me a little short of breath, too, especially when I’m lying down.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or whitish mucus, tickly sensation, and some shortness of breath, particularly when lying down. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, about your heart – you said you’ve had trouble for a while. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure about… oh, eight years ago now? Maybe nine. It means my heart doesn’t pump as well as it should. I take my medicine every day, like I'm supposed to. Water pills mostly, and something to help it beat stronger. I try to watch my salt, too. But lately… I feel more puffed up, you know? Like I’m carrying extra water. And tired. Just… really tired. Even after a good night’s sleep, if I can get a good night’s sleep with this cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure diagnosed eight to nine years ago, taking water pills and something for the heart, watching salt… and recently feeling more puffed up and fatigued. That’s helpful information. Just to be clear, when you say "puffed up," are you noticing swelling in your ankles or feet, or is it more all over?
PATIENT: Mostly my ankles, Doctor. And my feet, sometimes. They get really swollen at the end of the day. I have to put my feet up for a while before they go down. And if I sit for too long, it gets worse. It's been worse the last couple of weeks, along with this cough. It’s making me worry it’s something more with the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles and feet swelling worsening over the last couple of weeks, coinciding with the cough. That's definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles to see how much swelling there is. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you know? This is just… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/86. Heart sounds… I can hear a bit of a murmur, which we’ve documented before, but it does seem a little louder today. Lungs… I’m hearing some crackles, especially in the lower lobes, both sides. And as you mentioned, your ankles do have significant pitting edema – meaning there's noticeable swelling that leaves an indentation when I press on them. Now, I'd like to get a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your heart and lungs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. An X-ray and an EKG. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. And if it’s something to do with the heart, I need to know what we can do about it. I'm a little worried, to be honest. This doesn’t feel like my usual heart trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Nadene, and it's good you're bringing it up. It’s always best to be thorough. The X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid buildup in your lungs, which could explain the crackles I heard, and the EKG will check for any changes in your heart rhythm or signs of strain. While we're waiting for those results, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I’ve been a little more breathless than usual just walking around the house. Not a lot, but enough to notice. And I’ve been feeling a bit confused sometimes, a little… foggy. Hard to remember things, like what I had for breakfast yesterday. It’s not all the time, but it happens. Oh, and my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t feel very hungry. I've lost a few pounds, I think. Not a lot, but enough for my clothes to feel a little looser. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased breathlessness with activity, some confusion or "foggy" feeling, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss… all of those are important things to note. These symptoms, combined with the swelling and changes in your heart sounds, are making me concerned about potential worsening of your heart failure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I always tell my pharmacist too, just to be safe. They keep good records, you know. I think they do, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And could you list the medications you’re currently taking, if you can remember?
PATIENT: Let me think… there's Furosemide, that’s the water pill, 40 milligrams every morning. And then there’s Digoxin, I think it’s 0.125 milligrams, every day as well. Oh, and I take a baby aspirin, 81 milligrams, just to protect my heart. That’s all I take regularly. Sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that's only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide 40mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, and baby aspirin 81mg daily. And Tylenol as needed. Thanks for that. Alright, Nadene, the X-ray and EKG results should be back shortly. While we wait, I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP level. The BNP level will help us assess how much strain your heart is under. It sounds like we need to rule out a worsening heart failure exacerbation, and potentially other causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this. My heart… it feels different this time. And I don't want to end up in the hospital if I can avoid it. I haven't been feeling myself lately, and this cough is just making everything worse. So yes, do all the tests you need to do. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I understand your concerns, and we will get to the bottom of this. It's good you're being proactive. I'll step out now to get those labs ordered, and I'll be right back to discuss the results of the X-ray and EKG as soon as they're available. It should only be a few minutes. Please just relax and try not to worry. I'll be with you shortly.
