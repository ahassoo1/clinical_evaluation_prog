DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well… honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been going to the restroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. I… I'm not sure exactly when it started, to be perfectly frank. Everything feels a little hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie, no need to be embarrassed at all. It’s important to discuss these things so we can figure out what's going on. You mentioned going to the restroom “quite a lot” more than usual. Could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. That’s difficult. Um… let me think. Before, I’d go, maybe… four or five times a day? Normal, I think. Now… it feels like every hour or two. Sometimes more often. It’s… disruptive. I’m trying to recall if anything changed around the time it began, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, a noticeable increase from four or five times a day to every one or two hours. And you’ve also noted some difficulty with your memory recently. Is this memory issue a new development, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely… newer. It’s been, perhaps, six months or so. It started gradually, just forgetting little things – where I put my keys, appointments… now it’s… well, like trying to recall when this problem started. It's frustrating, to say the least. I haven’t really spoken to anyone about it, honestly. I just assumed it was stress, or… getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased urinary frequency for an undetermined amount of time, and worsening memory issues for about six months. Are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or burning. Just… the constant urge to go. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… inconvenient, and worrying, naturally. Sometimes, I feel like I have to go, even if there’s not much actually there. It’s… a strange sensation. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Feeling the urge even when your bladder isn't full is important information. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. My appetite has been… normal, I think. Perhaps a little less than usual, but I haven't been feeling particularly hungry lately, and I attribute that to just… general worry, to be honest. It's hard to enjoy a meal when you're constantly thinking about where the restroom is!
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Ms. MacVittie, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that's about it, I believe. And… a broken wrist, years ago, but that healed completely. I haven’t been to the doctor regularly in… a long time, to be truthful. Just for check-ups, I mean. Nothing serious, ever. I really don't recall any specific diagnoses.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history aside from tonsillectomy and a healed wrist fracture. And you haven’t been seeing a doctor regularly. Have you had any surgeries other than your tonsils and wrist?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the tonsils as a child and the wrist, many years ago. No other surgeries, no. I… I really pride myself on staying healthy, usually. That’s why this is so unsettling. I'm usually very careful about what I eat and I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was young, and I wasn't particularly close to my father. I don't… I don't really know much about their medical history. I know my mother had… some sort of stomach problems, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… well, he wasn't one for sharing. I apologize; I wish I could be more helpful. It’s a bit of a blank, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie, that’s perfectly alright. It's understandable that you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but nothing excessive. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I lead a fairly… quiet life, actually. I work as a concierge at a local hotel, and I enjoy reading and gardening in my spare time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any adverse reactions to medications in the past. I’ve only needed a few antibiotics in my life, and those were all well-tolerated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie. That’s good to know. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I prefer to avoid medications if possible. I might take an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing regularly. I really try to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, so I haven’t felt the need for anything extra.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll gently palpate your abdomen. Finally, I'd like to do a simple neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Coordination is intact. Alright, Ms. MacVittie. The physical examination didn’t reveal anything acutely concerning. However, given your increased urinary frequency and recent memory issues, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a urinary tract infection, although you don't have any pain or fever, which is unusual. The memory issues could be related to stress or other underlying conditions. It’s important to investigate further. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary, I’m happy to do. A urine analysis and a blood test… alright. I understand. It's just… a little worrying, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and investigate further.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried. We’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. I’ll have the lab draw your blood now, and I’ll send the urine sample with them as well. The results should be back within a few business days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water per day. I also suggest keeping a bladder diary – noting how often you urinate, the amount of urine you pass, and any associated symptoms. This will help us get a clearer picture of your urinary frequency. I’ll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the tests and determine the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Eight glasses of water, a bladder diary, and a follow-up appointment in a week. I can certainly do that. A bladder diary… that might be a bit tedious, but I understand the importance of it. And… what if the tests show something concerning? What would happen then? I don't mean to be difficult, but it's better to be prepared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. MacVittie. It's always best to be informed. If the urine analysis shows signs of an infection, we'll start you on a course of antibiotics. If the basic metabolic panel reveals any abnormalities, we’ll need to investigate further to determine the underlying cause. However, given your recent memory issues, and if the initial tests are inconclusive, I may recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any neurological conditions. Ultimately, the treatment plan will depend on the results of the tests and the underlying cause of your symptoms. I’ll explain everything to you in detail and involve you in the decision-making process every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. A neurologist if necessary, antibiotics if it's an infection… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… reassuring to know you’re taking it seriously. So, the lab is right here then? And I just… go and have the tests done? I hope it won't take too long. I have a few appointments scheduled at the hotel later this week that I can't reschedule easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is just down the hall, first door on the right. They are expecting you. It shouldn’t take too long, perhaps 20-30 minutes. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, give you the lab requisition forms before you go. She'll also provide you with instructions on how to collect a urine sample. Once you’ve had the tests done, please let Sarah know, and she’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. I’ll also have her print out a bladder diary for you to start filling out. Do you have any questions about finding the lab or the collection process?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage. Down the hall, first door on the right… Sarah will give me the forms and instructions. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to Sarah, in advance. I suppose I’ll just… go and get it done then. I appreciate your time, and your patience with my… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. Don’t worry about the forgetfulness, it's perfectly understandable. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Sarah is just outside the door now; I'll have her come in and get you settled. Have a good day, and we’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
