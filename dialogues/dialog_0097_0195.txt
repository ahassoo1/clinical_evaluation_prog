DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you too, I suppose. Well, it’s not a real problem, you see. I just…I was hoping you could write me one of those cards. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or maybe an “Encouragement” one. My sister, she always gets a lovely card from her doctor when she feels a bit low, and it just…lifts her spirits. It would be nice to have one myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janeth. You'd like me to write a card for you, something to boost your spirits. That’s perfectly alright. It’s good to take care of your emotional wellbeing. Before I do that, though, would you mind if I just ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions? About…what, exactly? I mean, I don’t have anything wrong. It’s not like I’m sick or anything. Is this necessary? Honestly, it feels a bit silly to be answering questions just for a card. My sister never had to do this.
DOCTOR: You're right, it might seem a little unusual just for a card. But as a doctor, I always like to get a little bit of background, even if it’s just to understand what’s going on in your life and why a card might be helpful right now. It helps me write something truly meaningful for you, and it allows me to check in and make sure there isn’t anything else going on that we should address. It doesn't have to be a long conversation, just a few general things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect a long story. I’m not one for…sharing. What do you want to know? Just get it over with, really. My time is valuable, you know. It’s not like I’m sitting around with nothing to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. Let’s start simply then. Can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally lately?
PATIENT: Generally? Oh, goodness. Well, things are…fine. As fine as they ever are. My husband, he doesn’t help much around the house, which is frustrating. And the neighbours, they’ve started having parties again. Loud music, keeps me up at night. It’s a nuisance, honestly. And the price of vegetables! It’s outrageous. Honestly, it’s just…life. Nothing exciting, nothing terrible. Just…annoying. Is that what you want to know? The general state of annoyance?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Janeth. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you're dealing with some everyday stressors – things with your husband, the neighbours, even just the cost of living. Those can certainly add up. Are these things relatively new, or have they been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, they've been going on. My husband…well, he’s always been like that. Lazy, that’s what he is. And the neighbours, they’ve always been a bit loud. It comes and goes, really. It's just been worse lately, I think. With the weather being nice, they're having parties every weekend. It's inconsiderate, really. People used to have some manners, you know? Now it’s just…noise. Honestly, it's a wonder I get any sleep at all. You’d think people would have more respect for their elders.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating to deal with that consistently, Janeth. Not having restful sleep certainly impacts everything. Have these things – the lack of help from your husband and the noise from the neighbours – been affecting your sleep significantly, or is it more of an occasional disturbance?
PATIENT: Oh, it's significant, Doctor. Very significant. I wake up tired every morning. Absolutely exhausted. And it's not just the noise, it’s the constant…disappointment, you know? Expecting a bit of help, a bit of consideration, and getting nothing. It’s draining. It really is. I try to tell my husband, but he just…doesn’t listen. He says I’m making a fuss over nothing. Men! Honestly, they just don’t understand. And then I lie awake thinking about it, and I can't get back to sleep. It's a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: I’m truly sorry to hear that, Janeth. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's understandable that you’re feeling exhausted and frustrated. Chronic stress and lack of sleep can really take a toll on your health. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Well... I suppose I haven't been eating as well. I just don't have the energy to cook. I used to enjoy making traditional Nepalese dishes, but now...it seems like too much effort. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes are feeling a bit looser. But honestly, Doctor, that’s probably just because I'm not eating properly. It’s not like I’m ill. I just…don’t feel like it. Everything feels like such a chore. It's just... everything. Do you need to know all of this for the card? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Janeth, it’s perfectly alright that you’re feeling frustrated, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. And no, I don't necessarily need to know all of this for the card. But because you've mentioned feeling exhausted, changes in appetite and weight, and a general lack of energy, I'm a little concerned. It's possible these symptoms could be related to something more than just stress. While I’m happy to write you a card, as a doctor, I feel it would be responsible to rule out other possibilities. Would you be open to a quick physical exam – just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen – and perhaps a simple blood test to check for things like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A physical exam? For a card? Honestly, Doctor, you are being absurd. I came here for a card, not a medical examination. I don’t want to be poked and prodded. I don’t need your tests. I just want a nice little card to cheer me up. I think I’ll just go. This is a waste of my time. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite annoyed.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth. You're absolutely right, you came for a card, and I respect your decision. I apologize if I’ve overstepped, and I certainly don’t want to cause you any more stress. I am happy to write you a card. Would you like me to write one with a general message of encouragement, or would you prefer something more specific?
PATIENT: A general message will do, I suppose. Something...nice. About...being strong. Or maybe about taking things easy. Something along those lines. Just…don’t make it too cheesy. I’m not one for sentimental things. And please, no mention of needing to see a doctor. I think I've made my feelings on that quite clear. Just a simple card. That’s all I want. And then I’d like to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. A simple message of encouragement it is. I'll write something thoughtful and uplifting for you, and definitely no mention of seeing a doctor. Here you go. I hope this brightens your day a little. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. That's quite enough. Thank you, I suppose. Though it’s not exactly what my sister gets, it will have to do. I think I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. It was lovely meeting you, and I truly hope you feel better soon. If you ever do want to talk about anything further, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day. And please, take care of yourself.
