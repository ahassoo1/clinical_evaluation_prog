DOCTOR: Hi Avril, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Polczynski? My… how you say… the office send me for this… check. A telehealth, they call it. I am here because they want to… see if I am feeling alright. I am… mostly alright, yes. My husband… he passed last year, and then I think maybe I am not so strong as before. But I work, you know? I fix cars.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, call me Doctor Polczynski. That sounds perfectly fine. I see. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot recently, with the loss of your husband. And you’re still working, fixing cars – that’s good to hear, very active! It’s understandable to not feel quite yourself after something like that. Just to clarify, when you say “not so strong,” can you tell me a little more about what you mean?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, the cars… they keep my mind busy. It is… good work. Not so strong… hmm. Not like before, yes. I get… tired faster. And sometimes, my hands… they are not so steady as they used to be. When I am working on the engine, it is… difficult sometimes to hold the wrench tight. And… my back, it aches a little. Not all the time, but… more than before. Is that… what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, increased fatigue, some unsteadiness in your hands, and back pain… all more noticeable than before. And when did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say exactly. After my husband… everything was… blurry. But I think… maybe six months ago? It was slow, you know? Little by little. At first, I thought it was just… sadness. But it did not get better, and then the hands started… and the back.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, gradually worsening… that gives me a good starting point. And has anything specific made these symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. No, not really. Just… working. Long days at the shop, sometimes. Lifting heavy things, you know? But I always lift heavy things. It is my job! Maybe… when it is very cold, my hands are worse. More shaky. But… mostly, just working. Is that… a bad thing, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to activity, and perhaps a little worse in the cold. It's not necessarily a "bad" thing, Avril, but we want to figure out why you’re experiencing these changes. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: No, I do not mind. Other changes… hmm. I… sometimes I forget things. Small things, you know? Where I put my glasses, or… the name of a customer. Nothing big. But… more than before. And I… maybe I am not sleeping as well as before. I wake up a lot during the night. Is that… important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory issues and trouble sleeping. Yes, that is important. Both of those things can be related to a number of things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you lost or gained any weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat… normally, I think. Maybe a little less when I am very tired. And I have not… lost or gained weight. I am… always the same size. Maybe a little heavier in the winter, because of the coats, but… not much. I do not worry about the weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appetite and weight are stable. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My husband… he had the blood pressure. Very high. I took him to the doctor many times. But I… no. I never had any… problems. The doctor… he always said I was very healthy. Just… strong bones, he said. I had all the checks, you know? Every year. But it was a long time ago, maybe ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, and regular check-ups until about ten years ago. That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But that was… very long time ago. Just a cast. Nothing serious. I am… a strong woman, Doctor. I do not get sick easily.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Avril. It sounds like you’ve been very healthy for most of your life. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, dementia, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had the arthritis. Very bad, in her hands. She could not hold things, in the end. And my father… he had the heart problems. He died… when I was young. But… that is all I can remember. My family… they are mostly all gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Nothing. I do not like to take pills, if I can help it. I believe in… strong body. And good food. And hard work. That is what keeps me healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had one. I eat… everything. And I have not… reacted to any medicine. I am… a simple woman. I do not have… fancy problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, Avril, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a few simple tests of your strength and balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. I do not mind. I am… used to doctors, you know? Always checks. Whatever you need, just… tell me. I want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Great. If you could just sit up there for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… okay, let’s see… 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning right now. Now I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs… take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Everything sounds clear there. Now, could you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. Is that… good? I am not so young as before, you know. Maybe my hands are not so strong. But I work with the wrenches all day! Very hard work.
DOCTOR: That’s good, very good. A little less strong than I’d expect for someone your age and activity level, but still functional. Okay, now, if you wouldn’t mind, just stand up slowly and try to balance on one leg for a few seconds. Either leg is fine. We're just checking your stability.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Oh… this is… difficult. My balance is not so good. I think maybe I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, please sit down. Okay, so we have slightly elevated blood pressure, some decrease in hand strength, and some difficulty with balance. Those things, combined with the fatigue, memory issues, and sleep disturbances you’ve been experiencing, suggest a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as vitamin deficiency, or it could be an early sign of something more… complex. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. They'll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… what is happening. I do not want to… become weak. I need to fix the cars, you know? People need their cars fixed!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and we will figure this out together. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in to draw the samples shortly. It will just be a few vials of blood. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to a specialist, a neurologist. They specialize in the nervous system and can help us pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's best to get their expert opinion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Hmm. I do not know what that is, exactly. But if you think it is best, Doctor… then yes. I trust your judgement. You seem… very smart. I just want to be sure I can still fix the cars, you know?
DOCTOR: A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nerves – things like memory, balance, and movement. They’ll be able to run some more detailed tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. And don’t worry, we’re not jumping to any conclusions. This is just a precautionary measure. The tests will give us more information, and we’ll go from there. The nurse will give you the referral slip, and you can call their office to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have… explained everything very clearly. Thank you for… listening to me. And for not laughing at me when I wobble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Avril. Wobbling is perfectly normal! And you didn’t need to worry about being laughed at. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to take it easy, get plenty of rest, and call the neurologist's office to schedule an appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Here are the printed results and referral. If you have any concerns before your appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You too. Goodbye. I will… call the office. And try to rest. But… the cars need fixing, you know? .
