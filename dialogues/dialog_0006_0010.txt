DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Thomassoni, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I was hoping you could take a look. It’s been… present for a little while now, but it seems to be getting a bit more noticeable recently. I don't quite recall when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling… right. A little while now, getting more noticeable. Hmm. Can you tell me where exactly you’re noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the location. It's primarily… around my jawline, I believe. And perhaps a little on my cheeks as well. It’s not terribly painful, just… puffy. It's hard to describe. I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Jawline and cheeks, puffy… no pain. Don't apologize, it happens. It's good you’re bringing it to my attention. Just trying to get a picture here. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Anything… changed? That's a good question. Let me think. I… I started a new vitamin supplement a few weeks ago, perhaps a month? It was recommended by a friend for… energy, I believe. Other than that… not that I can readily recall. I have been travelling a bit for work, but nothing drastically different from usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, new vitamin supplement about a month ago, for energy. And some work travel. Right. Do you remember the name of the supplement?
PATIENT: The name… that's the difficult part. It was… a green bottle, I think. And the name was… something botanical? With a “vita” in it, certainly. Ugh, this is terribly frustrating. I feel awful about not being able to remember something so simple. It was from a health food store, a local one. I really wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps the store could tell me?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, don’t worry about it. We can try and figure it out. A green bottle, something botanical with “vita” in the name…we'll see if it pops up in your records. Let's move on for a moment. Any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think carefully. No, nothing immediately springs to mind. No fever, no difficulty breathing, no pain. I haven’t noticed any changes in my appetite or sleep patterns, either. Actually… now that I mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more tired lately, but I just assumed it was the travel. Is that relevant, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A little more tired, potentially related to travel. Okay. Have you had any changes to your diet recently, other than the supplement?
PATIENT: No, not really. I try to eat a reasonably balanced diet – lots of vegetables, lean protein. Nothing dramatically different. I've always been careful about what I consume. I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the mornings, but that's been a constant for years. I am trying to drink more water. Is that something that could have an effect?
DOCTOR: Drinking more water is good. Let’s take a look at your medical history. I see here you haven't had a lot of previous medical issues, which is good. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so, no. Nothing that I’m aware of, at least. I haven’t had a reaction to any food or medication that I can recall. My family history is generally quite healthy as well, although my grandmother did have some… joint issues, if that's relevant. I don’t know the specifics, unfortunately. .
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, family history generally healthy. Okay. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, besides the vitamin supplement?
