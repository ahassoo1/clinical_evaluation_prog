DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Dr. Cora, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway. I’m here 'cause I can’t… breathe good. Not like I used to. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. Real scratchy. It’s been gettin’ worse, I think. Not sure when it started started, though. Old age, probably. Everything’s fallin’ apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. "Can't breathe good," dry mouth, and scratchy eyes... and it’s been worsening. When you say you "can't breathe good," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. Well… it’s like… air ain’t fillin’ my lungs all the way. Like somethin’s blockin’ it. I gotta… work at it, you know? Used to be I didn't even think about breathin’. Now, every breath… it’s a job. And it makes me tired, real tired. Does that make any sense? I don’t do good with explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Shortness of breath that requires effort, and it’s new. And it’s causing fatigue. Have you noticed this shortness of breath with any particular activities – like walking, climbing stairs, or even just talking?
PATIENT: Talkin’… yeah, actually. I get winded just… carryin’ on a conversation. Especially if I get excited. Or… annoyed. Which happens a lot these days, lemme tell ya. Walkin’? Not so much. I don't do much walkin' anymore. Too hot, too many… people. I mostly sit in my chair and watch the television. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with exertion, specifically talking, and you mostly rest. Have you had a cough at all?
PATIENT: A cough? Not really. Not a bad one. I clear my throat a lot. It feels… dry. Like somethin’ stuck back there. But no, no real coughin’. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. Oh, musta been… fifty years ago? Before your mother was born, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of smoking, but quit fifty years ago. That's good to know. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah. Not that I know of. I don’t bother checkin’ my temperature. Waste of time. Chills… maybe sometimes when the air conditionin’ is too strong. But that's just bein' cold, ya know? Night sweats? No. I sleep pretty good, actually. Except for… gotta get up to pee a lot. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent urination. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I haven't really looked at my feet lately. I wear slippers most of the time. Let me see… … Oh. Well, now that you mention it, they’re a little puffy. Not huge, but… not normal. Probably just from sittin’ too much, right? I told ya, I don't get around much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some ankle swelling. And you mentioned dry mouth and scratchy eyes. Are you taking any medications currently, or have any allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! I take somethin’ for my blood pressure. Little white pill. And… somethin’ for my arthritis. Makes my hands hurt less. And… that's about it, I think. Allergies? Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to somethin’ when I was a kid, but I forgot what it was. Happens when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication and something for arthritis. Do you know the names of those medications, or what they look like?
PATIENT: Names? Goodness no. I just take 'em. My daughter, Maria, she fills my pill box. She tells me what to take, when to take it. I don't bother with the names. They're little pills. The blood pressure one is… white, I told ya. And the arthritis one is… smaller. And maybe pinkish? I honestly don't pay attention. Don't ask me to remember things, doc. It's a lost cause.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. Well, it sounds like we have a few things to consider. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just don't poke me too much. And don't tell me I need to exercise. I hate exercise. My knees would never forgive you.
DOCTOR: I promise no exercise lectures. Let’s just take a listen, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Get it over with. Hurry up, though. I got my stories on in a few minutes. Can't miss those.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Your heart sounds… regular, but a bit faint. And when I listen to your lungs… I hear some wheezing, especially on your right side. Are you experiencing any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: Wheezin’? What's wheezin'? Sounds bad. Chest pain? No, not right now. But… sometimes. Not a sharp pain, more like… a tightness. Like somethin' squeezin' my chest. It happens when I get excited, or… when I'm breathin' real hard. It doesn't last long, though. Probably just indigestion. I eat a lot of spicy food. Maria tells me I shouldn't, but… what's life without a little flavor, huh?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent chest tightness with exertion and excitement. That's concerning, Mr. Guilds. Given your history of smoking, shortness of breath, wheezing, and the chest tightness, I think we need to do some further testing. I want to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And I'm going to order a blood test to check your oxygen levels and rule out any infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and proddin'? What's wrong with just tellin' me I'm gettin' old and need to rest more? I don’t like tests. They always find somethin’ wrong. But… fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… don't keep me here all day. I got important things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I understand your frustration. These tests will help us figure out what's going on so we can get you feeling better. The chest X-ray is just a picture of your lungs, and the EKG is a quick, painless test that checks your heart’s rhythm. I’ll have the lab draw some blood now as well. The nurse will explain everything to you. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a prescription for an inhaler to help with your breathing. It's a bronchodilator, which means it will open up your airways. It might help relieve some of that wheezing and shortness of breath. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Inhaler… like those asthma people use? Sounds… complicated. And more medicine. Ugh. I just want to breathe normal again. And you're gonna poke me again for blood? This is ridiculous. What kind of doctor are you anyway? I never liked doctors. They always make things worse. But… fine. An inhaler. Blood. Whatever. Just make it quick, okay? And tell Maria to bring my stories when she picks me up.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Guilds. I’m trying to get to the bottom of what's going on so we can get you back to feeling like yourself. The inhaler is a good first step. It’s often very helpful. The nurse will show you how to use it. And I promise we'll keep everything as quick as possible. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw the blood and go over the inhaler instructions with you. Just try to relax, okay?
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done, doc. Fine. Go get your nurse. But if she stabs me, I’m holdin’ you responsible. And tell her to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. Honestly, the youth these days don't know how to do anything right.
DOCTOR: I’ll let her know to be as gentle as possible. I’ll be right back to discuss the results when they come in. Please let me know if you have any questions while you’re waiting.
PATIENT: .
