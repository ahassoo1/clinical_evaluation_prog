DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do small talk. I just… I want to get pregnant. I lost my husband, and I want a baby. Quickly. I don't want any trouble with it, you know? Problems getting pregnant and all that. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re hoping to conceive, and you’d like to ensure a smooth process. A commendable goal, Ms. Villarreal. However, "quickly" isn’t always medically advisable, and we need to assess a few things before we proceed. It’s important to ensure your health is optimal as well. To begin, have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… yes, I had one. A long time ago. With my husband, obviously. It was… fine. Normal, I suppose. Look, I really don't remember the details. It was… stressful, and I don’t dwell on the past. Does it matter? I just want this next one to be easy. No complications, alright?
DOCTOR: “Normal” can mean different things to different people, Ms. Villarreal. And past experiences do matter, even if the details are vague. Were there any complications during that pregnancy or delivery?
PATIENT: Complications? Honestly, I don’t recall. I think… maybe some swelling? Towards the end? It was a long time ago, Doctor. Things blur. He… my husband handled all the medical stuff. I just… carried the baby. And then… well, you know. I just want to skip all the fuss this time. Is that possible? Can we just… check if everything’s alright and go?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your desire for efficiency, Ms. Villarreal, a thorough evaluation is crucial. “Skipping” steps could potentially jeopardize both your health and the health of a future pregnancy. Let's start with a review of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, perhaps?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now we're getting into all this? Look, I’m generally healthy. I eat… mostly well. I’m not overweight. My husband always said I was fine. No, I don't have any of those… things. Diabetes? High blood pressure? No. Never been told that. I have… a bit of trouble sleeping, sometimes. But that's just stress. Is that important? Can we just… move on?
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances can be relevant, Ms. Villarreal, particularly when planning a pregnancy. However, we’ll touch on that later. Let’s confirm what you’ve stated. You’ve indicated no known medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Not that I recall. Maybe… tonsils when I was a child? A really long time ago. Nothing major. I definitely haven't had anything recently. Honestly, I’m not a hospital person. I avoid doctors whenever possible. Is that helpful? Can we please get to the part where you tell me I’m good to go? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. Tonsillectomy in childhood, no other surgeries reported. Now, concerning medications… are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I take… a multivitamin, sometimes. Just the basic one. And I take something for my sleep, occasionally. It's… a herbal thing. My sister recommended it. Helps me relax. It’s… chamomile, I think? And lavender? Something like that. I don't remember the name. It’s not a big deal. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Chamomile and lavender, alright. Even seemingly harmless supplements can interact with potential medications during pregnancy. It’s important to have a complete list. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not really. I mean, I don’t like shellfish, but that’s not an allergy. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy person. I eat my greens, I try to get enough sleep, and I don’t go around touching things I shouldn’t. This is all feeling very… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. However, a thorough medical history is paramount, even for healthy individuals. Before proceeding, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And my grandmother… she had something with her stomach. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago. Honestly, we didn’t talk about medical things much. It was considered… impolite. I really don’t know the details. Is this going to take much longer? I have appointments later.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I appreciate you sharing what you recall. However, your reluctance to provide detailed information is making it difficult to assess your overall health and potential risks. While I respect your privacy, it is my professional responsibility to gather as much information as possible to ensure your well-being and a healthy pregnancy. Before we move forward, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Excuse me? Are you implying something? I am a respectable woman. Of course not. I do not engage in any of those… activities. That's a rather rude question, Doctor. I came here for help getting pregnant, not an interrogation. Really, I think I want a second opinion. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Villarreal, do not misunderstand. These are standard questions asked of all patients, regardless of their background. They are essential for evaluating potential risks to a pregnancy. I apologize if I’ve offended you. However, given your reluctance to provide a complete medical history, I strongly recommend a full blood panel and a consultation with an OB/GYN specialist. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and address any potential concerns. I can arrange those referrals for you. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Blood tests, specialist… just hurry up and write whatever you need to write so I can go. I suppose I have no other choice. But I expect everything to be done quickly and efficiently. I don't have time for delays. And I’m not paying for anything unnecessary. Do you understand? I want a baby, not a medical adventure.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I will prepare the referral orders for a complete blood panel and a consultation with Dr. Eleanor Vance, an excellent OB/GYN specialist in the area. I will also include a note regarding your desire for a prompt and efficient evaluation. Here are the forms. Please take them to the lab and schedule your appointment with Dr. Vance. The lab results will be sent directly to her office. .
