DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hilber. I am Dr. Blim. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out, you see. Like it just… stays in there. It's been happenin’ for a little while now, maybe a week or so. It’s worryin’ me some.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. It's not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And I have to… push, sometimes. Which doesn’t seem right. I don’t usually have to do that. It feels like it's not emptyin’ completely, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And you’re experiencing incomplete emptying… requiring you to strain. We need to be precise, Mr. Hilber. Can you quantify this for me?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh. Um… how much is left? You mean like, how much water stays in? That’s a hard question, Doctor. It's not like a cupful, but it's more than just a little. Like… after I go, I feel like I could go more, even when I can’t. Does that make sense? I'm not good at measurin' these things. It's just a feelin'. A bad feelin'.
DOCTOR: A “bad feeling” is not a clinical finding, Mr. Hilber. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… stream? Oh. Well, it’s not as strong as it used to be, I guess. It doesn’t come out like a… a good, steady flow. It’s… weaker. And sometimes it starts and stops. Like it’s breakin’ up. Does that make any sense, Doctor? I’m tryin’ to explain it the best I can. It’s not a normal, strong stream, that’s for sure. Not like it used to be when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Weakness and intermittency. Very well. Are you experiencing any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, sir. No burnin’ at all. And not really discomfort, like I said. It’s just… that feelin’ of not gettin’ it all out. It’s more of a fullness, you know? And the weakness of the stream. That's the bothersome part. Not the feelin’ of pain, but the feelin’ that somethin’s not workin’ right. Like a garden hose with a kink in it, maybe? It just isn't pushin’ like it should.
DOCTOR: A kink in the hose… a rather simplistic analogy, Mr. Hilber, but I gather you mean reduced force. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No blood at all. Just… the weak stream. And the feelin’ of not emptyin’. I check, you know? I always check. And there’s never been any blood. Not that I’ve seen. That would be… worryin’, of course. It's just… this emptiness. This feelin' of not gettin’ it all out. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I'm gettin' a little nervous now. I'm a widower, you see, and I don't have anyone to help me with these things.
DOCTOR: We'll determine the cause, Mr. Hilber. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got that under control with pills. Stopped takin’ ‘em a few years back, and it’s been fine ever since. Aside from that… nothin’ really. I used to be pretty strong, workin’ in the factory, but that was a long time ago. And my wife… she always took care of the doctorin’ for both of us. I don’t really keep track of these things, if I’m bein’ honest. Is that bad, Doctor? I feel bad askin' you all this, and not knowin' the answers. .
DOCTOR: It is… suboptimal. Any surgeries, Mr. Hilber?
