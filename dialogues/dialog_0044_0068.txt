DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Sasha. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs, mostly. They’ve been… puffy. Since the treatments, you know? For the… the sickness. It’s hard to explain. It's just... swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, “puffy” swelling since your treatments. That's a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about those treatments?
PATIENT: Oh, um… they gave me… the medicine. Through the vein. Lots of times. And then… radiation. It was a while ago now. Maybe… six months? It’s hard to keep track. It was at the big hospital in the city. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the names of things, sorry.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sasha, don't worry about the names. Six months ago, you received chemotherapy and radiation at the city hospital. And the swelling… is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, mostly. But my left one… it’s worse. Like, much puffier. And sometimes… it feels heavy. Like I’m walking through water. It doesn’t hurt, not really, just… uncomfortable. And makes shoes hard!
DOCTOR: Okay, so both legs are puffy, but the left is significantly worse and feels heavy. No pain, just discomfort and difficulty with shoes. That’s helpful. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, when I sit for a long time, it gets worse. Like, if I’m watching TV all afternoon. And… putting my feet up helps. A little. Also, warm weather makes it worse, I think. It's so hot now! Does that make sense? I try to wear loose socks, too.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. Worsening with prolonged sitting, improvement with elevation, and exacerbation in warm weather – those are all important clues. Let’s talk a bit more generally now. Have you noticed any changes in your skin on your legs, like redness, sores, or thickening?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. No sores, no. The skin feels… a little dry, maybe? And a little bit… harder than usual. Not all over, just on my ankles. I put lotion on it, but it doesn't seem to help much. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin and some hardness around your ankles. That’s good you’re using lotion, even if it’s not providing much relief. Now, have you had any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Oh no, no chest pain! And no dizziness. I get a little… tired, sometimes, but that's just getting old, I think. And… no, no shortness of breath. Just tired. I walk a little bit every day, but not much. It's hard with my legs like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. No chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Just some fatigue. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I had high blood pressure, but they give me pills for that. And… I had a little bit of diabetes, but that’s… under control now, with pills too. That's all I can think of. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Sasha. High blood pressure and a history of diabetes, both currently managed with medication, and a vitamin D supplement. Excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix out. And… I had a little surgery on my hand, a long time ago, when I was working. Not important, I think. Just a little thing. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a minor hand surgery. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother had… heart trouble, I think. And my father… he had problems with his legs too, when he got old. Swelling, mostly. I think that’s why… that’s why I worry about this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. A family history of heart trouble and leg swelling. That's good information. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies! I eat everything! Well… I don’t like shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. No medicine allergies, no food allergies, no… nothing. I'm a pretty simple person, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulses, and take a look at your legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My legs are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. I'll be very gentle. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Pulses are present in both legs, although the pulse in your left leg is slightly weaker than your right. And I can definitely see some swelling in both legs, more pronounced on the left, as you mentioned. Your skin is a little dry, and there's some mild hardening around your ankles. I don’t see any redness or open sores. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing lymphedema, likely as a side effect of your cancer treatments. The chemotherapy and radiation can sometimes damage the lymphatic system, which can lead to fluid buildup in the legs. The slightly weaker pulse on the left could be related, or it could be something else entirely. To be sure, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Lymp-a-what-a? Oh dear. Is that bad? So, it is the treatments? And tests… what kind of tests? I don’t like tests.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema is a buildup of fluid in the legs, Sasha. It’s not necessarily “bad” in itself, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can sometimes lead to infections. It’s quite common after cancer treatment, so it's not surprising. It does sound like it’s related to your chemotherapy and radiation. The tests I’d like to order are just a few simple blood tests to rule out other possible causes of the swelling, like kidney or heart problems. And an ultrasound of your legs to get a better look at the blood flow and the lymphatic vessels. It’s painless, just a gel and a probe on your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… so it’s not my heart? That’s good. And just blood tests and… ultra-sound? No needles? Okay. Yes, that sounds… okay. As long as it’s not too long. I don’t like being at the doctor’s for too long. Can I still wear my shoes?
DOCTOR: No, it's unlikely to be your heart, Sasha, but these tests will just give us peace of mind. And yes, just blood tests and an ultrasound, no needles beyond the usual blood draw. And yes, you can definitely keep your shoes on for the ultrasound. We just need access to your legs. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and the radiology department. It will probably take a few days to get the results. While we’re waiting, I want to recommend some things you can do at home to help manage the swelling. Would you like to hear about those now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything that helps. My legs are just so tired. What can I do? Tell me everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. First, continue elevating your legs whenever possible. When you’re sitting, try to prop them up on a pillow or ottoman. Second, gentle exercise is really important. Even just walking for a short distance each day can help improve fluid drainage. Avoid strenuous activity, though. Third, wearing compression stockings can help reduce swelling. We can get you a prescription for those. Fourth, try to limit your salt intake, as salt can cause fluid retention. And finally, keep your skin moisturized to prevent infections. I’m also going to have the nurse give you a handout with these instructions and some information about lymphedema. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, compression stockings… like tights? That sounds… uncomfortable. And I like salt! But… okay. I’ll try. A handout would be good. I always forget things. So, these things will help… even if it’s from the treatments? And… is there anything else? Some kind of cream or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, compression stockings are like tights, Sasha, but they're designed to provide support and improve circulation. There are different levels of compression, and we can find a pair that’s comfortable for you. And I understand about the salt – it's hard to give up! But even just reducing your intake a little can make a difference. There are some creams that can help with skin dryness and irritation, but there's no cream that will directly treat the lymphedema. Mostly, it's about managing the swelling and preventing complications. I'm going to write you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema. They can teach you specific exercises and techniques to help reduce the swelling and improve your quality of life. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A physical therapist? Oh dear. More doctors… But… if it helps my legs, I guess. Will they make me do hard exercises? I can’t lift very much. And… how long will this take? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Sasha. A physical therapist specializing in lymphedema is different from a typical physical therapist. They're very gentle and will tailor the exercises specifically to your needs and abilities. They won’t push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. It's about finding what works for you. As for how long it will take, that’s hard to say. It depends on the severity of the lymphedema and how well you respond to treatment. But with consistent exercise and compression, many people see significant improvement. It's not a quick fix, but it's definitely possible to manage the swelling and improve your quality of life. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests and ultrasound done, and getting you scheduled with the physical therapist. I’ll have the nurse give you the paperwork and instructions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I’m still worried, but… a little less worried than before. Maybe these stockings won't be so bad after all. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get through this together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the paperwork. .
