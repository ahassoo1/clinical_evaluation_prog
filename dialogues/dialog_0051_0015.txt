DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um... my sinuses, they are... bothering me. It has been… a little while, I think. Not sure exactly how long. It feels full, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus trouble. “A little while,” you say… difficult to pinpoint the exact start date, that's alright. Fullness is a good way to describe it. Is that fullness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days it is worse than others. When I lay down, it feels… heavier. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Heavier when you lay down… that’s helpful information. And you mentioned it’s not exactly pain, more of an uncomfortable fullness. Do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes my nose feels… blocked. Hard to breathe through it. And… I think I cough a little. Not a bad cough, just… small. I don’t… I don’t know if that is from the sinuses.
DOCTOR: Okay, nasal blockage and a small cough. It’s quite common for sinus issues to cause both, so that fits. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or facial pain – maybe around your cheeks or forehead?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… I don’t think so… about the pain. Maybe a little… pressure sometimes? Around my forehead, like a… a tight band. But not… a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure around the forehead… that's good to know. Just to get a better picture, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Maybe. It feels… familiar. But my memory… it is not so good. I have had… some problems remembering things. It was… a while ago. I don’t remember if it was the same.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. Memory can be tricky. We'll work through it together. Do you have any allergies – to pollen, dust, animals, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I live… outside the town. Lots of plants around. But I haven’t ever… noticed anything bad from them. Maybe a little sneezing sometimes, but everyone does that, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about any medications you’re currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t take anything regularly. Nothing for… for me. Sometimes, when my back hurts, I take something. Ibuprofen, I think. But not often. And I haven’t taken anything for this sinus… problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for back pain when needed, but nothing for your sinuses. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and sinuses, and take a look at your nose and throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Your lungs sound clear. I'm feeling some tenderness when I press on your forehead, mostly around here . Your throat looks a little… mildly irritated, but nothing too concerning. Your nasal passages are a bit congested, as you mentioned. Do you have any pain when I press on those spots?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not sharp, like a… pressure. It’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It feels… worse when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort with pressure and bending over… that’s consistent with what I’m seeing. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses. It could be caused by a simple viral infection, or potentially allergies, although we haven’t confirmed any specific allergies yet. I'd like to start with a conservative approach. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, for the discomfort. Also, nasal saline rinses twice a day to help clear the congestion. And plenty of fluids. We’ll see how you respond to these measures. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further investigation, such as a CT scan, and potentially a referral to an ENT specialist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Saline rinses, pain relievers… I can do that. I have some ibuprofen at home. And… I will drink more water. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm going to give you a printed sheet with instructions on how to perform the nasal saline rinses, and a summary of what we discussed today. If you start to develop a high fever, severe headache, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you for your help. You have been very kind. I will… try my best to follow your instructions. I hope it gets better soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or you’re not improving, don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you a speedy recovery. And please, stay hydrated! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
