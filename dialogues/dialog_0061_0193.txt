DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Jammal. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it is a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But I have… a lot of gas. More than usual, I think. It has been happening for maybe… two weeks now? It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: “Bula vinaka to you too, Jammal. No need to be embarrassed at all – digestive issues are very common, and we’re here to help figure things out. Two weeks, okay. Constant… could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks, I believe. And by constant, I mean… throughout the day. After I eat, definitely. But even when I haven’t eaten for a while, it happens. Not… huge bursts, usually. More like… little pops and rumbles. And the smell… sometimes it is not very pleasant, if I am being honest. I work at the burger place, you see, so maybe it is something I ate? I do not know.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful. So, it’s been happening for two weeks, pretty consistently throughout the day, even when you haven’t eaten recently, and you’ve noticed the odor can be… noticeable. And you’re wondering if it might be related to your work at the burger place. That’s a very reasonable thought. Let’s explore that a little further. Aside from the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, just the gas. No pain, no… changes in how I go to the bathroom. Nothing like that. I feel… normal, other than being a bit self-conscious, to be honest. I am a little worried it is something… bad. But I do not know what. I eat mostly the same things I always have. Except maybe I have been eating more of the french fries from work, because they are… good.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so just the gas, no other digestive changes, and you’re feeling otherwise normal, just a bit self-conscious. That’s good to know. And you’ve noticed you've been eating a bit more fries from work lately. Fries are tempting, aren't they?
PATIENT: Yes, very tempting. I try to be good, but… they are always so fresh. And warm. I suppose it could be that, yes? I do not know much about… food and the stomach. Do you think the fries are the problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “It's definitely a possibility, Jammal. Fried foods can sometimes cause excess gas. They’re higher in fat, which can slow down digestion and lead to bloating and gas. But it's good to rule out other things too. Before we jump to conclusions about the fries, let's talk a little bit about your overall diet. Aside from the fries, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. A typical day… Well, for breakfast, I usually have toast with a little bit of jam. Sometimes an egg, if I have time. Lunch is usually a sandwich from the burger place – nothing fancy, just ham and cheese. And dinner… it varies. Sometimes I cook, like maybe chicken and rice. Other times I just have something simple, like soup or a salad. I drink mostly water, and sometimes a little bit of juice. I do not drink much soda.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that gives me a good picture. Toast, sandwiches, chicken and rice, soup, salad… sounds like a fairly balanced diet overall. And good on you for drinking mostly water. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome or lactose intolerance?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I have never been told I have any problems with my stomach. I had my appendix out when I was a child, but that was many years ago. And I get the usual yearly check-up with my regular doctor, but he has never said anything about my stomach. I am a pretty healthy person, I think. I just… have this gas problem now.
DOCTOR: “Okay, good to know. Appendix out as a child, and otherwise healthy with regular check-ups. That’s helpful. And you’re right, having a gas issue now doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have digestive problems like bloating, gas, or irritable bowel syndrome?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she always complained about her stomach. Not gas, exactly. More like… heartburn. And she was always trying different diets. But I do not think anyone else in my family had… gas problems. My father was very healthy, and my sister… she eats everything and never seems to have any trouble.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so your mother had heartburn, but no one else in the family with specific gas or digestive issues. That's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I do not take any pills or anything like that. Just… vitamins sometimes, when I remember. But I have not taken any in a while, honestly. I try to get my vitamins from my food.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no medications or regular supplements. That simplifies things. Alright, Jammal, based on what you’ve told me – the recent onset of gas, no other digestive symptoms, a generally balanced diet, no significant family history, and no medications – it sounds like this is most likely related to something you’re eating. The increased fry consumption is a strong possibility. Before we definitively say that’s it, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright with me. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again, you see. The gas is… embarrassing. So if you think listening to my stomach is a good idea, please do so.
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Jammal. It’s good to rule things out. Alright, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. Okay, listening to your abdomen, your bowel sounds are normal – active, but no unusual gurgling or anything concerning. No tenderness to the touch. That's reassuring. So physically, everything seems fine. Based on everything you’ve told me and the examination, I strongly suspect this is a dietary issue, likely related to the increase in fried food consumption. I recommend trying to cut back on the fries for a week or two and see if your symptoms improve. If that doesn’t help, we can explore other possibilities, like trying a low-FODMAP diet or testing for certain food sensitivities. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely try cutting back on the fries. It will be difficult, but I want to feel better. A week or two… I can do that. And if it does not help, I trust your guidance to explore other options. Thank you very much for your time and help, Doctor Kimm. You have put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Jammal. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. It’s often something simple like this. Just keep track of your symptoms while you’re reducing the fries, and if things don't improve within two weeks, give the clinic a call and we’ll schedule a follow-up. Here’s a little handout about dietary changes for bloating and gas. It has some helpful information and tips. Do you have any other questions for me today before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. That handout is very helpful, thank you. You have answered all of my questions and made me feel much better about everything. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. I think… I think that will be all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Jammal. It was my pleasure. Remember, if you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call. Vinaka vakalevu, and have a good day. ”
