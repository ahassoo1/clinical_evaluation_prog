DOCTOR: Alright, Blain. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, well. It's my family, mostly. Lots of…problems. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, died young. Heart, I think. And my aunt…she's got some sort of autoimmune thing. Always complaining. Honestly, it’s a bit dramatic. But my mother keeps saying I need to get checked, just in case. It’s…annoying, really. I feel perfectly fine. But she's got Medicare now, so she wants me to use it while I can, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, family history…important. A bit dramatic, you say?
PATIENT: Understatement. She milks it for all it’s worth. Always talking about how fragile she is. It's… exhausting. But seriously, the aunt's always got something. And then the grandfather…he was a bit of a mess, if I’m being honest. Lots of bad habits. I just…don’t want to end up like them, I suppose. But I feel…good. I exercise, I eat okay. Shouldn’t be a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said you exercise and eat reasonably well?
PATIENT: Yes. I run, usually three times a week. And I try to avoid processed foods. It's common sense, really. Not like everyone else, filling themselves with junk. It's basic biology, you know? A healthy lifestyle. Shouldn't need a doctor to tell me that. But my mother…she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Blain. It’s always helpful when patients take their health seriously. Still, it’s good to get a check-up now and then, just to be sure. Now, aside from the family history, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. That's the whole point! I told you, I feel fine. No chest pain, no… whatever it is people complain about. Just…general anxiety, maybe? From being constantly told I'm about to drop dead. Is that a symptom? Because if so, I’ve got a severe case. Honestly, it's more annoying than anything. It's a waste of everyone's time, really. But, fine. I guess I can list a couple of headaches. Stress-related. Probably. From my mother.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note, carefully. "Headaches - stress related?
PATIENT: Okay. And these headaches…where do you feel them? And how often would you say you get them? Don’t tell me it’s just from your mother, though. I need specifics, or this is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Right, specifics. Good point. Usually…around my temples, I think. And it’s not constant. Maybe…twice a week, if that?
PATIENT: Twice a week if I'm being bothered. It's hard to keep track. It's not like I schedule them, you know? Sometimes they’re worse, sometimes they’re barely noticeable. It's all tied to stress. Work, mostly. And, yes, also my mother. She calls constantly, asking if I’m feeling “warm” or if my “skin looks pale.” It’s exhausting. I'm a perfectly healthy adult. Really. Do you…need me to elaborate on the stress factors? Because I can.
DOCTOR: No, I think I understand. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I've been a little tired lately. But that’s just from working, honestly. Long hours. I'm an engineering teacher, so grading papers and preparing lessons… it takes a lot out of you. Is that…is that something to worry about? I mean, everyone gets tired, right? It's not like I'm collapsing or anything. I just…could use a longer weekend. And maybe a different mother. But that's not medically feasible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue. Right. Now, your intake form lists your height as 181 centimeters and your weight as 60 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I weigh what I weigh. What’s the point of asking? Are you suggesting something? I'm not… I eat perfectly well, as I already mentioned. It's a bit rude, really, to question my weight. I'm perfectly healthy. Just because I'm…lean doesn't mean I'm unhealthy. I'm an endurance runner, remember? We’re not built like…well, never mind. It's a bit insensitive, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn't questioning anything, Blain. I just want to get a complete picture. Your weight is a little on the lower side for your height, and I want to ensure everything is okay. I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general condition. Standard procedure. It’ll only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But if you're just going to tell me I need to eat more, I'm walking out. I already explained I’m healthy. This is ridiculous. But…fine. Do your “standard procedure”. Just be quick about it. I have papers to grade. And a mother to avoid. But seriously, don’t tell me to eat more. It’s insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Blain. I understand. Let’s just do a quick check-up. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 110/70. And finally, I'll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat appears normal. Okay, Blain. Everything seems normal so far. However, your slightly diminished breath sounds and lower weight do warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: “Further investigation?” See? This is exactly what I was afraid of. What does that even mean? Are you going to run a million tests? This is going to cost a fortune. And my mother is going to be insufferable. I told you I was fine. This is a complete waste of time. What are you even thinking?
DOCTOR: It’s not about thinking you aren’t fine, Blain. It’s about being thorough. Your diminished breath sounds could indicate something minor, like a past respiratory infection, or simply your build. But it's best to rule out anything more serious. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will check for any underlying infections or nutritional deficiencies. And the X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. A chest X-ray? That’s ridiculous! I am not going to be exposed to radiation for…what? Because you heard a slight difference in my breathing? It’s a waste of money, a waste of time, and frankly, a bit insulting. I told you, I'm an endurance runner. My lungs are fine. I refuse. I'm walking out now. This is absurd. I knew I shouldn’t have come. Just…forget it.
DOCTOR: Blain, please. I understand your concerns, but I’m trying to provide you with the best possible care. The X-ray is a relatively simple procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. It's simply a precautionary measure. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was necessary. However, if you absolutely refuse, I respect your decision. But please understand that without these tests, it's difficult to determine the cause of your diminished breath sounds. Would you at least consider the blood tests?
