DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s about my coloring, I suppose. It’s rather…yellow. I believe it's the liver, but truthfully, my memory isn't what it used to be. I was told this was the place to come, for…problems like this. Is this correct?
DOCTOR: Yellow coloring…right. You suspect a liver issue. Okay. And how long have you noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…difficult to say precisely. A few weeks, perhaps? It came on gradually. Honestly, Doctor, time seems to slip away these days. It wasn't sudden, I can assure you. I just…noticed it when I was looking in the mirror, and it worried me. I don't recall anything specific starting it.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, gradually. Alright. And besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… I’ve been rather tired, yes. More tired than usual, and a little bit… achy. Just a general feeling of unwellness, if that makes sense. My appetite hasn’t been very good either, but that’s not particularly new, I’m afraid. Is that helpful? I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Durig. Fatigue, achiness, decreased appetite… Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements or the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those are…rather personal questions, aren’t they? I…I believe my stool has been paler than usual. Yes, I think so. And my urine… well, it's been a sort of dark tea color, perhaps? I don’t usually pay close attention, if you understand. It’s…difficult to recall specifics. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Durig, these questions are necessary. Pale stools and dark urine… Okay. Now, have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting, thankfully. And I haven’t been nauseous, not really. There has been a bit of discomfort… a sort of dull ache in my upper abdomen, but nothing sharp or severe. It comes and goes, mostly after I eat. It's not constant. Is…is this serious, Doctor? I do worry.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Durig, these symptoms can indicate a number of things. The discoloration, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort…it's not something we can dismiss. It certainly warrants further investigation. I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any liver conditions, like hepatitis or cirrhosis?
PATIENT: Oh my. Hepatitis…yes, I believe so. A long time ago, Doctor. Very long ago. I don't recall the specifics, I'm afraid. I was younger then, and these things… they weren’t explained as thoroughly as they are today. I remember being unwell, and then…getting better. I don’t know what kind of hepatitis, or if it was ever fully resolved. I’ve never been told I had cirrhosis. Is that a bad thing? I truly wish I had better records. I apologize for being such a burden.
DOCTOR: A history of hepatitis, unspecified…Wonderful. Alright. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with hepatitis, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…very difficult. It must have been…in my thirties, perhaps? Or early forties. A long time ago, as I said. I’ve lived a long life, and things blur together, you see. I was working… somewhere. I truly can't recall the year or the location. It was before… before my sister passed, if that helps at all. That was…1987, I believe. So, before then, definitely. I apologize. This is terribly unhelpful, isn't it? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. We'll work with what we have. Now, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions… Oh, let me see… I believe so, yes. Once. A long time ago, when I had surgery. It was… a fall, I think. Broke my hip, perhaps? Or was it my arm? It was a rather messy affair, if I recall correctly. I was in the hospital for quite some time. It was before… before my daughter moved away. That was… 2003, I believe. So, before then, yes. I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more certain of these dates. My memory…it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And… sometimes something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But that's only as needed, you see. I can't recall the names of them, I'm afraid. I have my daughter fill my prescriptions, and she handles all of that. I just take what she gives me. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. Is this terribly frustrating for you, Doctor? I do try to remember, but it's just…difficult. Perhaps I should just stop now and save you time?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, it’s… challenging, certainly. But we'll proceed. We need to get a better understanding of your situation. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. But, as I've said, I don’t have a very good memory. It’s possible… but I truly don't think so. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. Are we almost finished, Doctor? I’m rather tired, and this is… taxing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, and then I'll order some blood tests. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Can you stand up and let me listen to your heart and lungs?
