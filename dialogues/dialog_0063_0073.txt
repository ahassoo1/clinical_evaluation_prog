DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's try to be brief, shall we?
PATIENT: Brief is good. Look, I’ve been dealing with this… situation for weeks now, and honestly, I don't have all day to rehash everything. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: “Fix it,” is rather unhelpful, Ms. Woodring. I need information to ‘fix’ anything. However… weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! Since… well, right after the memorial. It started a couple days after, really. And it's not like I haven’t tried things. You think I enjoy running to the bathroom constantly? I’ve taken everything the drugstore had, and it hasn’t done a thing.
DOCTOR: The memorial…right. And this…bathroom issue. Is it…diarrhea?
PATIENT: Is that really what we’re doing here? Yes, it’s diarrhea! Severe diarrhea. I just told you. It's not…normal. And it won’t stop. It's ruining my life, honestly. I need to get back to work, but I can’t exactly be painting houses when I have to excuse myself every five minutes.
DOCTOR: Painting houses… A physically demanding profession. And how many times, precisely, would you estimate this… episode occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know, exactly. Like I said, it’s constant. But a good guess? Probably… at least ten times a day. Sometimes more if I try to eat anything. It's awful. And it's not just…watery. It’s… other things. I don't want to get into details, but it’s unpleasant. Really unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Ten times a day… accompanied by… discomfort, I presume?
PATIENT: Discomfort? That's putting it mildly! It's cramping, it's bloating, it’s… humiliating, frankly. I feel weak, I’m tired, and I'm constantly worried I'll have an accident. Look, I’m a grown woman. I don't need to describe every detail, but it’s not pleasant. Are you going to help me or just ask questions?
DOCTOR: I am attempting to gather sufficient information to formulate a plan, Ms. Woodring. Do you have any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these… episodes?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Just…the diarrhea. And the cramping. Honestly, it feels like something I ate, but I haven't changed anything in my diet. And I’m very careful about where I eat. I’m not one of those people who just eats anything. It's really frustrating. I’ve tried everything. I really need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: “Everything,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. I took… Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, charcoal tablets… the usual stuff! And that herbal tea my neighbor recommended, though that did nothing. I even tried… plain toast for a couple days. It didn't change a thing. I really don't appreciate being interrogated like this. It's not like I want to be here.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea…right. And no recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No! Where would I be traveling to? I haven’t left the state in years. I live here. I work here. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are you suspecting I picked something up on a cruise? I have a business to run. I barely have time to sleep, let alone go on vacation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. Let’s move on. Do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. I was perfectly healthy before all this started. A little tired from work, but that’s normal. I take a multivitamin, that's about it. And, well, I was healthy. Before this whole mess. My husband… he always said I was as strong as an ox. It’s just… everything changed after he passed. But that's beside the point. I don’t have any conditions.
DOCTOR: And any family history of… gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know. My mother always complained about her stomach, but she complained about everything. And my father… he smoked and drank too much. It's a miracle he lived as long as he did. I really don't keep track of family medical histories. It's not something I find particularly useful, to be perfectly honest. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just going to keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. I need to assess your abdomen and listen to your bowel sounds. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table…
PATIENT: Lie down? Now? Seriously? Look, I’m a busy woman. I have appointments to get to. I was hoping for a quick diagnosis, maybe some medication, and a way to get back to work. Not a full-blown physical. I think I’m going to pass. I’m sure I just have a bug. Can’t you just give me something for it? I really don’t have time for this. I’m wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. However, a proper assessment is vital to ensure I am not missing anything serious. Given the persistence and severity of your symptoms, I cannot in good conscience simply prescribe medication without a thorough examination. I strongly recommend we proceed. If you refuse a physical examination, I can only offer general advice—stay hydrated and follow a bland diet. But I cannot be held responsible for any complications that may arise. Perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist?
