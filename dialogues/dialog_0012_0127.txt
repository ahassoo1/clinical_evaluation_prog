DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Dr. Yoshino. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, gradually, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It's becoming quite noticeable, and frankly, a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids over a few months… that definitely warrants looking into. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started… I suppose in my legs, a bit of trouble climbing stairs, things like that. Now it’s… it’s harder to get up from a chair, and I find myself using my arms to push myself up more often. It's not a sudden thing, it's just… gotten progressively worse. It's mostly in my arms and legs, though I think I feel a little bit tired more easily when I’m doing things with my hands as well. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, gradually worsening weakness in your arms and legs, and some fatigue with hand use. Okay. And you mentioned your eyelids drooping – is that worse at certain times of the day, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: It seems to be… worse later in the day, I think. In the mornings, it’s not so bad, but by the evening… they really start to feel heavy. And it's both eyelids, not just one. It makes it… a little difficult to keep my eyes open sometimes, honestly. I find myself blinking more often, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – worse later in the day, affecting both eyelids. And more frequent blinking. Have you noticed any double vision at all, or any changes in your vision besides the drooping?
PATIENT: Double vision… hmm. No, I don’t think so. My vision itself feels alright, I suppose. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I always assumed that was just my prescription needing an update. I had an eye exam about a year ago, and they said it was fine then. But no, no double vision that I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright, no double vision. And you had an eye exam a year ago which is good. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I haven’t been hospitalized or anything like that. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that was all. I've never been told I have any long-term health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the routine things, like wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a simple procedure. Nothing… significant.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's… a bit tricky. My parents are both… estranged, and I don’t really have contact with them. I know my mother had something with her nerves, I think? She was always complaining about tingling in her hands and feet. But she never really talked about it much, and I didn’t press her. My father… I honestly don't know much about his health at all. He wasn’t around much when I was growing up. So, I’m afraid I don’t have a lot of information there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Limited family history, but a potential nerve issue on your mother's side. We can work with that. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a Facilities Manager, so I’m on my feet quite a bit, doing inspections, coordinating repairs… it’s a fairly active job, physically. I live alone. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it can be difficult with my schedule. I don’t really have any hobbies at the moment, unfortunately. I used to enjoy hiking, but I haven't had the energy for it lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, active job, healthy lifestyle generally, but limited energy recently. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can take most medications without any problems. I did have a bit of a stomach upset when I took antibiotics for a sinus infection a few years ago, but that wasn’t a proper allergy, just a bit of indigestion, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and a few other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. Rudi taps Gedalya's knees with a reflex hammer. Both knees are responding, but a bit diminished. She then checks his biceps and triceps reflexes. Similar finding - present, but weaker than I’d expect. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Here you go. I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but… it's not as strong as it used to be, I don’t think. I feel it tiring out quickly. I can keep squeezing, but it’s definitely not my full strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty. That’s helpful to know. Rudi tests Gedalya's resistance to her movements in his arms and legs. Alright, now I’m going to check your strength by having you resist me. Can you push against my hand as I try to bend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m trying… It’s… it’s harder than it should be. Especially in this arm… my right arm. It feels… weaker. I’m pushing as hard as I can, but you’re stronger than you look!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Rudi repeats the test on Gedalya's legs. And your legs are showing similar weakness. She observes Gedalya carefully. I also notice some mild ptosis – drooping of your eyelids – is more pronounced now. She palpates Gedalya's neck and checks his pupils. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, and I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. She listens to Gedalya's heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on the exam, there's definite weakness in your arms and legs, and the ptosis is noticeable. It’s important to investigate this further. I’m thinking we should start with some blood tests and potentially an MRI of the brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests and an MRI… whatever you think is best, Dr. Yoshino. I trust your judgement. I just… I want to find out what’s going on. It's unsettling to feel myself getting weaker like this. An MRI sounds… a bit daunting, to be honest, but if it will help, then yes, please. What kind of blood tests are you thinking of? And… roughly how long would an MRI take?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your anxiety, and we’ll take things one step at a time. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes, and you’ll be lying flat, so if you feel claustrophobic, we can discuss medication to help with that. As for the blood tests, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and some specific antibodies to rule out autoimmune conditions. These tests can give us a better understanding of what might be causing your weakness and ptosis. We'll also check for Creatine Kinase levels, as muscle inflammation can sometimes cause these symptoms. Do you have any concerns about the blood draw itself?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. I don’t mind needles, thankfully. I've always been alright with blood draws. So, Creatine Kinase levels… is that something that would show up if it is muscle inflammation? And autoimmune conditions… that sounds a bit… serious. I suppose it's good to rule things out, though. Thirty to forty-five minutes for the MRI… I can manage that. And you said something about medication for… feeling closed in? That's good to know. I’ll keep that in mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Creatine Kinase levels will be elevated if there's muscle damage or inflammation, yes. Autoimmune conditions can sometimes cause muscle weakness and ptosis, but it's important to remember that doesn't mean you have an autoimmune condition – we're just ruling things out systematically. I'll order the blood tests now, and we can schedule the MRI for sometime next week. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those, we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, it's important to avoid any strenuous activity that makes your weakness worse. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds… logical. Avoiding strenuous activity is sensible, I suppose. I'll try to take it easy. So, just to be clear… I’ll get a call when the blood tests are back, and then we’ll talk about scheduling the MRI? And then, after the MRI… we'll have a better idea of what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right. You’ll get a call when the blood tests are back, and we'll discuss the results and schedule the MRI. After the MRI, we'll have a much clearer picture of what’s going on and can develop a treatment plan. I'll also have the nurse give you a handout with information about muscle weakness and ptosis. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – like difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll talk next week. Thank you for coming in today, Gedalya.
