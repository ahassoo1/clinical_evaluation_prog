DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury is fine. I… uh… want to know more about where my people come from. I hear you can do tests for that now? Like, with spit? My kids, they always ask about our family, way back. I want to tell them something real, not just stories.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “tests for that now” isn’t exactly how I’d put it, Laury. Genetic ancestry testing is… becoming more common, yes. But it's not a medical necessity, and frankly, it's not something we routinely offer here. We’re a family practice, focused on your health, not genealogy. However… I suppose we can discuss it. It’s not a test I personally perform, and it can be quite expensive. Are you hoping for a medical diagnosis related to your ancestry, or are you just curious about your family history?
PATIENT: Expensive? Oh. Hmm. I just want to know… where we really come from. Not just Marshall Islands, but before that. My grandma, she told stories, but… old people, you know? Stories change. I don’t need a… what you said? Diagnosis? No, just… where my people been. Is it… can it tell me what islands, maybe? Or countries? Before Marshall Islands?
DOCTOR: Okay, Laury. Let me explain it this way. These tests analyze your DNA – your genetic code. They compare it to databases of DNA from people all over the world. It can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins – percentages, usually. It might say something like “40% Polynesian, 30% Southeast Asian, 20% Micronesian…” and so on. It can pinpoint general regions, maybe even specific island groups. But it’s not a precise science. The databases aren't complete, and results can be… ambiguous. Also, it doesn’t tell you who your ancestors were, just where they likely originated. And, as I mentioned, it’s not covered by Medicare. It’s a cash-pay service, and it's… well, it's not cheap. Frankly, I think your money might be better spent on a good history book about the Marshall Islands, or even talking to elders who still remember the stories. But, if you’re still interested, I can give you a list of companies that offer these tests. Do you want that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That… sounds complicated. Not cheap, you say? How much, maybe? Just a rough idea. And… what if it tells me something I don’t want to know? Like… if we not from Marshall Islands at all? That would be… hard for my kids. They very proud.
DOCTOR: Well, Laury, the price varies a lot depending on the company and the level of detail. You’re looking at anywhere from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, easily. And there are always add-ons – more detailed reports, family tree building services… it adds up. As for what if it tells you something you don’t want to know… that’s a valid concern. It is possible. DNA is complex, and ancestry is rarely a simple, straightforward story. It might show you connections to places you didn’t expect. It's not a reflection on your kids' pride, though. Ancestry tests don't define who you are; they simply provide information about your genetic origins. They’re just… pieces of a puzzle. Honestly, Laury, I’m still not sure this is the best course of action for you, given your concerns and the cost. Have you considered talking to a cultural historian who specializes in the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Cultural… historian? I don’t even know what that is. I just want to make my kids happy. They ask and ask. Maybe… maybe if it not too expensive, just the cheapest one, I try? But… if it make trouble, I don’t want it. What’s the cheapest one you know? And will it… will it tell me bad things?
DOCTOR: Okay, Laury. Look, I'm going to be very clear. There's no guarantee it will tell you "bad things," but there is a possibility of unexpected results. It might reveal connections to groups with a difficult history, or show a more complex ancestry than you anticipate. It's not about "good" or "bad," it's about the information being… complicated. The cheapest reputable company I can think of is 23andMe. They have a basic ancestry service for around $99, sometimes on sale for less. But keep in mind, it's a basic service. It won't give you detailed information or personalized support. You'll be largely on your own to interpret the results. And even then, it's still just an estimate. I strongly recommend you read their terms and conditions carefully before you purchase anything, and understand what you're getting – and not getting – for your money. I will also say again, I am not recommending this test, I am just providing information because you asked. Are you sure you want me to write down the website for you?
PATIENT: Write it down, please. Just in case. I… I can think about it some more. Maybe ask my kids first. They good with computers. But… if it too much trouble, I won't do it. Thank you, Doctor. You very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It’s 23andMe.com. And you’re very welcome, Laury. I understand wanting to know your family history, and it's good you’re thinking it through carefully. Now, let’s get back to the reason you came in today. Is there anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No, no. That’s all. Just the… maybe the test. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that’s enough for today. My head is spinning a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. That’s perfectly understandable. Take your time, and don't feel pressured to do anything you're not comfortable with. If you do decide to pursue the test, and you have any questions about interpreting the results, feel free to call the office. Here's a discharge slip with some general health reminders. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
