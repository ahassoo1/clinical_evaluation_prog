DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It’s becoming quite noticeable, and frankly, a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, progressive weakness and drooping eyelids over a few months… that’s definitely worth looking into. Can you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, in my legs. Just a little bit harder to get up from a chair, things like that. Now… now it’s in my arms too. Lifting things is becoming a struggle. It’s not painful, exactly, just… difficult. And it seems to get worse as the day goes on. Like I tire out more easily. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue that worsens throughout the day is a key detail. And you said it started in your legs and has moved to your arms?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. Legs first, then it spread… gradually. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. More like a slow… fading of strength. It's hard to describe. And I haven’t noticed it anywhere else, not yet. I do feel a bit more clumsy than usual, if that counts for anything. I dropped my coffee this morning, which is… not normally me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, progressing weakness, now with some clumsiness… I'm noting all of this. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, besides the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, not really. My vision itself seems… fine. Things are clear, I haven't needed to adjust my glasses or anything. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes things seem a little blurry at the edges of my vision, especially when I’m tired. But I just assumed that was… fatigue, again. I haven’t paid it much mind. Is that… is that something I should be paying mind to?
DOCTOR: It’s good you brought that up – blurry peripheral vision can be significant. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I did have a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, quite some time, actually. Just for check-ups, nothing specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. What about your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a little complicated, actually. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I didn't know my father very well. As far as I know, there weren’t any… obvious genetic conditions in the family. My mother had some arthritis, I think, but nothing major. And I don’t really have any close relatives to speak of. I was an only child, and most of my family is… not around anymore, or I haven’t been in contact with them for a long time. I’m sorry, that’s probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’ve given me what you know, and that’s perfectly fine. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those, Doctor. Never have. I don't care for the taste of alcohol, and I've always steered clear of smoking and… other things. I lead a fairly quiet life, to be honest. I work, I read, I enjoy spending time outdoors when the weather permits. I try to eat a healthy diet, though I admit I’ve been a bit stressed lately and perhaps haven’t been as diligent as I should be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tobacco, alcohol or drug use. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Just a multivitamin occasionally, if that counts. But nothing prescribed by a doctor, and nothing regularly. I prefer to avoid medication if I can help it. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, if possible. Though, clearly, something isn’t working quite right at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything – food, pollen, animals… nothing. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I can’t recall ever experiencing an allergic reaction of any kind. Though, now that I think about it, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I mow the lawn, but I just assumed that was the grass. Is that… something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, though potential mild reaction to grass. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. Though, if you don't mind me saying, that was a bit harder than it used to be. I’m usually a bit more… steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just a few steps forward, if you would. And then back. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Alright. That felt… a little awkward, if I’m honest. I usually have a much smoother gait. I do hope you didn't notice anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and there’s some weakness in your arms and legs, consistent with what you've described. Your strength is about 4/5 in your upper extremities and 3/5 in your lower extremities. Now, I’m going to examine your eyelids closely. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… less than ideal, to be frank. A diminished reflex and weakness… that doesn’t sound good at all. I trust your judgement, Doctor. And please, do examine my eyelids, I'm quite concerned about them. Let me know if you see anything unusual. I'll try to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your eyelids are significantly drooping, and there’s some weakness in the muscles around your eyes. I don't see any fasciculations, and your pupils are reactive to light. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I'm concerned about a possible neuromuscular disorder. It’s too early to say definitively, but we need to run some tests to investigate further. We'll need a blood test to check for certain antibodies and inflammatory markers, and I also recommend an MRI of the brain and orbits to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be open to these tests?
PATIENT: A neuromuscular disorder… that sounds… very serious, Doctor. An MRI and blood tests… yes, of course. Anything that might help determine what’s going on. I understand you need to investigate, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Though, truthfully, I’m rather apprehensive about what the results might show. But I suppose knowing is better than not knowing, even if it's bad news. When can we schedule these tests? And… what kind of timeline are we looking at for getting the results?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your apprehension, and I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work right now, and you can go to the lab at the clinic on the second floor. They should be able to get those results back within 3-5 business days. As for the MRI, I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you. Availability at the imaging center varies, but we should be able to get you in within the next week or so. The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to be interpreted by the radiologist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, and please, if you notice any new symptoms – difficulty breathing, double vision, or worsening weakness – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Three to five business days for the blood work, and within a week for the MRI… that sounds reasonable. Avoiding strenuous activity is certainly sensible. And I will certainly go to the emergency room if anything worsens. Yes, I do have a question. What kind of neuromuscular disorder are you suspecting? Is it… something serious? And is it treatable? I understand you can’t give me a diagnosis without the tests, but… a general idea would be helpful. Even if it's just to mentally prepare myself.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, and I’ll do my best to give you some information without causing undue alarm. Based on your symptoms – progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, diminished reflexes – a few possibilities come to mind. One is Myasthenia Gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles. Another is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which is often associated with an underlying cancer. And, although less likely given your age and presentation, we also need to rule out other, rarer neuromuscular conditions. Many neuromuscular disorders are treatable, though the specific treatment depends on the underlying cause. For Myasthenia Gravis, for example, we have medications that can improve muscle strength, and in some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is often treated with immunotherapy and addressing the underlying cancer, if present. It’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need the test results to make a definitive diagnosis. Please try not to worry too much until we have more information. I know it’s easier said than done, but catastrophizing won't help. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… clarifies things somewhat, though it's certainly not reassuring. Myasthenia Gravis, Lambert-Eaton… I'll try to read up on them, though I suspect the internet will only make me more anxious. And you're right, catastrophizing won't help. No, I don't think I have any further questions at this moment. I think I just need some time to… digest everything. Thank you for your time and your thorough explanation. I'll schedule the tests as soon as possible and I will contact you if anything changes or if I have any further concerns.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Gedalya. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My assistant will give you the necessary paperwork and instructions for scheduling the tests. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care of yourself, and try to stay positive.
