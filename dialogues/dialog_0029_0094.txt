DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... hello. The lady on the phone... she said something about talking? About... stuff? I work with metal. Sheets. Big sheets. It’s... noisy. That's all I remember her saying, really. I don’t usually go to doctors. My husband, he doesn't like it either.
DOCTOR: Okay. The appointment was scheduled by our occupational health nurse. She mentioned something about concerns regarding your work environment and potential hearing issues. You work with metal sheets, and it’s a noisy job, as you said. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Hearing...? Oh. Yes, it is noisy. Very noisy. I… I wear earplugs sometimes. The pink ones. But they fall out. A lot. And sometimes I forget to put them in. It's just… a job. I need the money. Is this about… getting fired? Because I really need this job.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fontanazza, this isn’t about getting fired. We just want to make sure your hearing is okay, given the noise levels at work. It's common for people in noisy professions to have hearing checks. It's better to catch anything early, if there is a problem. We’re just being cautious. Let’s start with a few questions about your hearing… Have you noticed any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Changes...? Hmm. I... I don't know. My husband yells a lot. So maybe I don’t hear him as well? But he always yells. It’s hard to tell. Sometimes, at night, everything is… quiet. Too quiet. But that's probably just the neighborhood. It used to be louder. Is that… a change? I don't really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful information. It can be difficult to notice changes gradually. So, you've noticed some quietness at night, and perhaps some difficulty hearing your husband, who already yells frequently. Do you ever experience ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing...? Like… a telephone? No. Not a telephone. Sometimes… after a really loud day... everything feels… fuzzy. Like cotton in my ears. But no ringing. Definitely no ringing. I hate ringing. It’s annoying. My aunt had ringing. It drove her crazy. So, no, not ringing. Just… fuzzy. And quiet sometimes. Like you said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fuzzy feeling after loud days, and quietness at night. We'll need to do a quick hearing test to get a better idea of what’s going on. It won't hurt. It just involves wearing headphones and responding to some tones. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Headphones…? Like the music ones? I… I don’t like loud noises, even with headphones. But if you say it won’t hurt… and it’s quick… okay. Fine. But if it gets too loud, I’m stopping. My husband will be mad if I come home with worse hearing. He already complains I don’t listen to him.
DOCTOR: Fair enough, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll keep the volume very comfortable. We can stop at any time. I’ll explain everything as we go. Let’s just sit here, and I’ll get you set up.
PATIENT: Okay... But promise me, if it's too loud, you’ll stop. I really mean it. And… can I have a glass of water after? My throat feels dry just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll stop immediately if it’s uncomfortable. And absolutely, you can have a glass of water afterwards. Let's start with your right ear. I’m going to put these headphones on, and you just let me know when you hear a beep. It's a simple tone. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay... Okay. Beep... I’m listening. But… what kind of beep? A high beep? A low beep? Because I don’t hear very good high sounds. My husband always says my voice is too low, too. Maybe that’s why. Just tell me what kind of beep it is, okay? Then I’ll know if I’m supposed to hear it.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll start with a range of beeps, both high and low. Don't worry about knowing the kind of beep. Just raise your hand whenever you hear any sound, no matter how faint or high or low it is. I will change the tones and volume. Just focus on listening. Sound good?
PATIENT: Okay… Okay. Just any sound… Right. Any sound. Let’s… let’s just get it over with. Start it. But be careful, okay? I don’t want to get worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here we go. Do you hear anything?
PATIENT: … No. Nothing. Silence. Wait… is that… a buzzing? No… just the lights, probably. It’s very quiet. Too quiet. Are you sure it’s working? Maybe the machine is broken?
DOCTOR: The machine is working, Ms. Fontanazza. We're going to try a slightly higher volume. It's still very quiet for you, it seems. Do you hear anything now?
PATIENT: …Wait! Yes! I think… I think I heard something. Very faint. Like… a tiny bird. A very, very tiny bird. Was that it? That’s… that’s probably the loudest thing I’ve heard all day. Are you sure it wasn’t the bird outside? It’s probably the bird.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. That’s helpful. It appears you have some difficulty hearing higher frequency sounds, even at louder volumes. It's not uncommon with noise exposure. We need to continue the test on both ears to get a complete picture. But based on this initial response, it suggests we should consider hearing protection and further evaluation. Let’s switch to your left ear now. Same thing – just raise your hand when you hear any sound, and we’ll take it slow.
PATIENT: …Oh. This is bad, isn't it? My husband is going to be so mad. He said I should have retired years ago. He always says I don't listen to him, but… now I really can't, can I? Okay. Left ear. Just… get it over with. But… be careful, okay? Very careful. And can I have that water after? Please?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s good that we’re identifying this now. And we can certainly discuss options to improve things. The water is absolutely on the way after we finish. We'll get through this. Let's start with a very low volume again, and just tell me when you hear anything. Alright. Here we go… Do you hear anything now?
PATIENT: … No. Nothing. Still nothing. It’s… it’s like being underwater. Everything is muffled. Like someone is talking through a pillow. Maybe I am going crazy. My aunt… she said the ringing started like this. Oh, and… wait. I think… I think I feel a headache coming on. This is… this is too much. Can we… can we stop? Please? I really don’t think I can do this anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza. Absolutely. We’ll stop right now. I apologize. It seems this is a bit overwhelming for you. You're right to stop when you're uncomfortable. Here, please drink this. Based on what you’ve told me, and your response to the test, it’s clear that you have some degree of hearing loss, likely worsened by noise exposure. It’s also important to address your headache and stress levels. I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss appropriate hearing protection. I also think it would be helpful to talk with your primary care doctor about the headache and overall stress management. Would you like me to provide you with a list of audiologists in the area?
PATIENT: …Thank you. Yes. A list… that would be good. And… maybe something for my headache? It’s… it’s throbbing now. My husband is going to kill me. He said I was wasting my time. He said I was just making things up. But… it’s hard to hear. Everything is just… gone. Just… please. A list of audiologists. And something for my headache. And… maybe a note for my husband? Telling him I really do need help? He doesn’t believe anything I say.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm happy to provide a list of local audiologists. I can also write a brief note for your husband summarizing my findings and recommending further evaluation. Here’s the list of audiologists, and here's the note. I’ve also written a prescription for a mild headache reliever. I understand it can be frustrating when your concerns aren’t taken seriously. Please remember that you deserve to have your hearing evaluated and receive the support you need. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: …No. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you. For the water. And the list. And the note. Maybe… maybe this will help. Maybe he’ll finally listen. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
