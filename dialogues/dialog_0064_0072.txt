DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having trouble with my memory lately. It’s just… things aren’t sticking like they used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to discuss it. Memory issues can be concerning, and it’s always best to get things checked out. No need to be embarrassed at all. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “things aren’t sticking”?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like… forgetting who people are, or anything big like that. It's more… small things. Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll start a sentence and… the word just won’t come. And I’ve been repeating myself a bit, I think. My friend mentioned it, anyway. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, more difficulty with recall, rather than recognizing people or places?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! It’s not like I don’t know what things are, just… getting the information out, or remembering what I was doing a few minutes ago. Does that make sense? I hope I’m explaining it okay. It feels a bit silly talking about it.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. It doesn't sound silly at all. These kinds of difficulties are actually quite common. Now, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. I think maybe six months or so? It started gradually, so I didn’t really notice it at first. It's definitely gotten worse in the last couple of months, though. That’s why I finally decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with a gradual onset, worsening in the last couple of months. And has anything specific happened around the time you noticed it starting?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. No big life changes, no head injuries, nothing like that. I did start a new vitamin regime around then, actually. Just a general multivitamin, trying to be healthier. Could that have something to do with it? I don't know if vitamins cause memory loss, but… maybe it’s worth mentioning?
DOCTOR: That's good information to have, Ms. Heidenthal. It's always worth considering everything. While vitamins usually don't cause memory loss, some can have unexpected effects. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this memory trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess. But I also just turned 38, so maybe that’s just… getting older? I haven't really noticed anything else, no headaches, no dizziness, nothing like that. I’ve been sleeping okay, I think. Just… a bit forgetful, and a little more tired. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m not being very descriptive.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good you're trying to recall everything. Fatigue and memory issues can certainly go hand-in-hand. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Go ahead. I don't have a lot of medical problems, to be honest, but I’m happy to answer whatever you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I don't have any chronic illnesses, like diabetes or high blood pressure or anything. I get regular check-ups with my family doctor, and everything’s always been fine.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never needed any surgeries, thankfully. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, but that’s it. It was pretty routine, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother has… well, she has some memory problems as she’s gotten older. Not a formal diagnosis or anything, but she repeats herself a lot and forgets things. My father is perfectly healthy, though. And my grandparents… I don't really know much about their medical history, to be honest. They both passed away a long time ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. Knowing about your mother’s memory issues is important. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a dentist, remember?
DOCTOR: Right, of course! My apologies. That’s right, a dentist. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements, besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, but that’s it. And sometimes I'll take something for allergies, during the spring. But that’s about it. Nothing regularly, definitely. Just the occasional ibuprofen or allergy pill. Oh! And I use a fluoride toothpaste, does that count?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. No, fluoride toothpaste doesn’t count. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve had a few mosquito bites, of course, but nothing serious. I'm pretty good with allergies, thankfully. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay. Just some basic neurological checks, blood pressure, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Just to get a baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I was expecting something like this, to be honest. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Great. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to do a few simple neurological tests. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Okay. Reflexes are normal. Strength is normal. Sensory function is normal. I did notice a little difficulty repeating three words a few moments ago, but it's subtle. I'm going to make a note of that. Overall, the neurological exam is mostly normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… good to know, I guess. The difficulty with the words… is that concerning? I mean, I do forget things all the time, but is it anything serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Heidenthal. And it’s good you’re expressing that. The difficulty with the words is mild, and it doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious on its own. However, taken together with your reported memory issues, it warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or electrolyte imbalances. I also think a Vitamin B12 level would be helpful given the vague recall issues and the fatigue. Also, it would be useful to get a basic cognitive assessment. This is a series of simple tests that can help me evaluate your memory and other cognitive functions more formally. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, that’s probably a good idea. I mean, if it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m all for it. Blood work and a cognitive assessment… okay. Will the cognitive assessment be a long thing? I’m a little nervous about that, to be honest. What kind of things will it involve?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you’re comfortable with that plan. And it’s perfectly normal to be nervous about the cognitive assessment, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s not a difficult test, and it’s not meant to be stressful. It’s just a way for me to get a more objective measure of your cognitive abilities. It will take about 30-45 minutes, and it will involve a series of simple tasks. I'll ask you to remember a list of words, draw a clock, and perform some basic calculations. We'll also do a short word recall test. It's all very straightforward. I will arrange for a technician to come in and perform the cognitive assessment. I'll also send you a lab requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at any lab that accepts your insurance. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just gathering information at this point. And if the results are concerning, we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. 30-45 minutes isn’t too bad. I’ll schedule the cognitive assessment as soon as possible. And I’ll get the blood work done next week. Thank you, Dr. Smetak. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something to figure it out. It’s just… scary not knowing. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any foods I should eat, or anything I should avoid? Or… should I be taking any supplements?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared when you don’t know what’s going on. We'll work through this together. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do that might be helpful. First, make sure you're getting enough sleep—aim for 7-8 hours per night. A regular sleep schedule is also important. A healthy diet is also crucial. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive caffeine. As for supplements, I wouldn't recommend starting anything new without first discussing it with me. Some supplements can interact with medications or have unintended side effects. It’s best to wait until we have the results of your blood work before making any changes to your diet or supplement regime. Keeping mentally active is also helpful. Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as reading, puzzles, or learning a new skill. And finally, try to manage your stress levels. Stress can worsen memory problems. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s all very helpful advice, thank you. Sleep, healthy eating, mental stimulation, and stress management… I can definitely work on those things. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Dr. Smetak. I’ll schedule the assessment and get the blood work done as soon as possible. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It was my pleasure. Remember, I’m here to help in any way I can. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We'll review the results together and discuss the next steps once we have them. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
