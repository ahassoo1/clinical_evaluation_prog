DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather simple. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side too. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, certainly. And which ear is that, specifically?
PATIENT: The left one. It’s completely gone. Like someone flipped a switch. And as I said, the left side of my face… it just feels weak. I don’t have time for this, frankly. Is it something serious? I need to know if I can still travel next week.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness… that is concerning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Travel can certainly wait, given these symptoms. We need to investigate this properly. It could be serious. Have you experienced any dizziness, headache, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache… well, I get headaches sometimes, but nothing unusual. And speaking is fine, thank you very much. I'm perfectly capable of articulating myself. I just… I don’t understand why this happened. I haven’t hit my head or anything. Is it a virus? My sister had a bad cold last month, could it be that? I really need to get back to my schedule.
DOCTOR: A virus is possible, though less likely with the sudden onset of hearing loss. We need to rule out other causes. I'm going to need to perform a neurological exam and check your ear. Please lie down on the examination table, if you would. I'll need to assess your facial muscle strength and reflexes. This will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: A few moments? You said that five minutes ago! Honestly, this is quite disruptive. But fine, fine. Get it over with. Though I expect a very thorough explanation afterward. And quickly. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie flat, and I’ll begin. Follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head… left, right, up, down. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Really? Smile? As if I'm enjoying this. There. Happy now? It's difficult, you know. That side doesn't… cooperate. Honestly, I thought doctors were supposed to be more… efficient.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, accuracy is more important than speed, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, squeeze your eyes shut as tightly as you can. Don't let me pull them open. Hmm. Asymmetrical resistance. And now, try to puff out your cheeks.
PATIENT: Honestly. This is undignified. There. See? Completely useless. It’s like a balloon with a hole in it. Is this going to take all day? And what is it? Is it something contagious? I have a housekeeper, you know.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, but we need to determine the cause before we can be certain. Tell me when you can no longer hear this tone. On this side… and now… this side. Significant hearing loss on the left. Given your symptoms – sudden onset hearing loss, facial weakness, asymmetry with smiling and puffing cheeks – I’m concerned about Bell’s palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities, like a stroke. I'm going to order a stat MRI to rule out any structural issues. It’s the safest course of action.
PATIENT: An MRI? Now you’re talking! I haven’t had an MRI in years. Honestly, all this fuss over a little deafness and a droopy face… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. But how long will this “stat” MRI take? And will it interfere with my lunch reservation? I have a very important meeting afterwards, you know. And Bell’s… what did you call it? Is it… serious? Will I be able to travel next week? Tell me plainly, Doctor, because I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, with respect, your schedule is not my primary concern at the moment. Your health is. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes, and I will arrange for someone to reschedule your appointments if necessary. Bell's palsy is a temporary weakness of the facial muscles, often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. Most people recover fully within a few weeks or months with treatment – usually corticosteroids and sometimes antiviral medication. However, we need to rule out other causes of facial paralysis first. And until we have the MRI results, I cannot definitively say whether or not you will be able to travel next week. Traveling with untreated facial paralysis, especially if it’s accompanied by hearing loss, could be risky. I recommend postponing your trip until we have a clear diagnosis and treatment plan. I will send the order to radiology now, and someone will come and get you shortly. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: Postpone my trip? Absolutely not. I have been planning this for months! Honestly, the inconvenience… But fine, fine. Do your MRI. Metal implants? No. Pacemaker? Of course not. I take excellent care of myself. Though I do have a rather expensive watch… is that a problem? And will I be awake during this… procedure? I detest enclosed spaces. This is just dreadful. Simply dreadful. Just get it over with, Doctor. Honestly, the lack of efficiency… I might switch doctors after this.
DOCTOR: An expensive watch is unlikely to be a problem, Ms. Nissenbaum, but please remove it before the scan. And yes, you will be awake. You will lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still for approximately 20-30 minutes. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I’ve travelled the world, you know. Exotic foods, questionable street vendors… I’m quite robust. Just hurry up with this, Doctor. I have a luncheon appointment. And frankly, the sooner I know if I can travel, the better. This is disrupting my entire schedule. Honestly, I’ve never encountered such a delay in my life. Do I need to fill out any forms? Because I really haven't got time for paperwork.
DOCTOR: No paperwork. Fortunately. The radiology technician will explain the procedure in detail. They'll be in shortly to escort you. I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, but I assure you, this delay is in your best interest. We need to rule out more serious causes of your symptoms before we can proceed with a treatment plan. Please, try to relax. And if you experience any discomfort during the scan, notify the technician immediately. I’ll be reviewing the results as soon as they’re available. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more information.
