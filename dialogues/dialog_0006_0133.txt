DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Gorga. Well, it’s these forms. I need them notarized, I think? And maybe verified… they’re for some health things, you know. It’s all a bit confusing, to be honest. I just want to get it over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Right, the forms… yes. Notarization isn't really my area, to be honest. I'm a doctor, I deal with medical things. But, let's see if I can help clarify what they need from me. What sort of "health things" are these forms for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I didn’t… I didn’t realize. I just thought… well, it said ‘health forms’ and I figured the doctor’s office… Never mind. It’s for… a program. A little assistance program. They need a doctor to sign off on some things, saying I’m… well, saying I’m who I say I am and that I need the help. Is that making any sense? It’s all so complicated. I’m sorry to bother you with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Assistance program… right. So they need me to verify your identity and medical need. That’s… doable. It’s not a typical visit, but I can certainly document what I observe. Um… let's start with a quick check-up. Just to get a baseline. Have you been seeing anyone regularly for your health?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, it must be five years. Maybe longer. I mostly just try to stay active, you know? Walk a little, eat reasonably. I haven't had any big problems, thankfully. Is this going to take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Five years… alright. Well, a quick check-up is a good starting point. We'll just do some basics - blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll ask a few questions, just to get an idea of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to penicillin when I was a child, but I haven’t had that in… well, decades. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just… sometimes, for a headache, I'll take something over-the-counter. Nothing special. Can we just get this signed, if that’s possible? I really appreciate you even considering this.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, no regular medications… good. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam then. Could you just step up on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, I’m afraid. I mostly just go by how my clothes fit. Is this going to be a problem? I'm a little worried about the number.
DOCTOR: 110 pounds… okay. And your height is listed as 189 centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I’m rather tall, you see. It's… it's in my family. Do you need to know why I need this assistance program? I'd rather not go into detail if I don’t have to. It's a little… personal.
DOCTOR: No, no, you don’t have to go into detail. I just need to document that you’re seeking assistance. I’m just trying to get a general picture of your health. Let's check your blood pressure, if that's alright. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I always get nervous at the doctor. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just… hurry, if you wouldn’t mind? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90… slightly elevated. Nothing alarming, but something to be aware of. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad? My blood pressure, I mean? I don’t really understand these numbers. I just want to get this form signed and be on my way. It's just… so much paperwork for a little help.
DOCTOR: Breathing is clear, heart sounds regular... Blood pressure is a little high, but we can discuss that later. It could be just nerves, honestly. Okay, one more thing. Can you tell me if you’ve experienced any pain, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, really. I just haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. Can we please just get to the signing? I really don't want to take up more of your time. It feels like I'm wasting yours.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, I can document that you are a 76-year-old female seeking assistance, with no reported major medical complaints at this time. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise stable. Is that an acceptable summary?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Gorga. Really. Can we get it signed now? I have an appointment I need to get to. I really appreciate you squeezing me in. It means a lot. .
DOCTOR: There you go. Just let me make a quick note of the date... August 2nd, 2025. Alright, here you are. Now, I do recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss that blood pressure, but… …that’s up to you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
