DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get straight to it… I want to make sure everything’s… you know… working properly, if I decide to try again. It was… difficult last time, and I really don’t want a repeat of that.
DOCTOR: “Trying again,” you say. Right. Well, “working properly” is a rather vague description, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Well, what other way would I put it? I mean, I want to be able to have a baby, obviously. It shouldn’t be a complicated thing. My late husband and I… we tried for a while, and it just… didn’t happen. I don’t want to waste any time on… issues, if you understand.
DOCTOR: “Shouldn’t be a complicated thing.” Honestly, you’d be surprised. A lot of things can affect fertility. Let’s start with the basics. Have you seen a doctor about this before?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, a little. Back home, before… everything. But it was just the usual check-up stuff. Nothing specific about getting pregnant. Honestly, they didn’t seem to take it very seriously. A few blood tests, told me to relax, and… that was it. It wasn’t helpful, to say the least.
DOCTOR: “Relax,” they always say. Doctors. Alright. Well, that wasn’t a thorough workup, clearly. Let’s not dwell on that. I'm looking at your chart here... and it doesn’t say much. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood things, but nothing major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. A bit of high blood pressure, maybe, but it’s usually fine with a little bit of… something. A pill, I think? Doctor gave it to me a while back. I stopped taking it when… well, never mind. It’s not important.
DOCTOR: “A little bit of high blood pressure…” And you stopped taking the medication?
PATIENT: Yes, a while ago now. It wasn’t bothering me, and honestly, I just… forgot about it. I have a lot on my mind, you know? It’s not like I'm running marathons or anything. It’s just… a thing the doctor said I should take.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, stopping medication for high blood pressure isn’t ideal, even if you’re not a marathon runner. It can affect… everything. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! Honestly, do you expect me to remember every little pill I’ve ever taken? It was a small, white one, I think. Or maybe it was pink? Look, it was years ago. It doesn't matter now, does it? I’m perfectly fine. I just want to know if I can actually have a baby without any… problems.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly fine” is subjective, dear. And these things do matter. Alright, let’s move on. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m pretty… robust. I think I'm just a healthy person. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because I really don’t have all day, and I'd like to get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: “Sorted out quickly.” You seem very confident. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No! That’s… that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I told you, my husband and I tried. It didn’t happen. It was… disappointing, to say the least. Look, I don’t want to relive the whole thing. Can we just focus on now?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No previous pregnancies. Let's get a basic physical exam done. I need to check your blood pressure, just to be sure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll talk about some blood tests. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I don't understand why I need all these tests. It should be obvious if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: “Obvious” is rarely the case, dear. Now, if you’ll just have a seat… and try to relax. We’ll start with your blood pressure. It’s important, even if you feel fine.
PATIENT: Fine. But if this takes too long, I’m leaving. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally. 148 over 92. Hmm. A little elevated, as I suspected. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again…
PATIENT: Is something wrong? You're making a face. Are my lungs collapsing or something? Honestly, I feel perfectly healthy. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, your lungs aren’t collapsing. But I am hearing a slight murmur. It could be nothing, but it warrants further investigation. We need to do some blood work, and I'm going to recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: An EKG? More tests? Honestly, this is getting out of hand. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not become a medical experiment! But… fine. Do whatever you need to do, but I expect results quickly. And explain everything in simple terms. I don't understand all that doctor jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order the blood work and the EKG. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we’ll schedule the EKG for later this week. As for explaining things... I'll try to keep it simple. However, ignoring potential issues will not make them disappear. Now, do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. Honestly, I don't have time for a lecture. And make sure the nurse is gentle. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll let the nurse know. She’ll be in shortly. Please try to remain calm. It's just a few pricks. It’s necessary.
