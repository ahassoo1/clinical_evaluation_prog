DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Omar, suggested I come. He’s very… proactive, shall we say. He wants me to fill out some forms, in case… you know. In case something happens. He called it an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form. Frankly, I don’t understand the fuss. I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s certainly good of your husband to be thinking ahead. Those forms are about planning for the future, yes, but also about making your wishes known. It's not necessarily about anticipating something happening, but about being prepared. Before we get into paperwork, though, let's just talk. You said you feel perfectly healthy. Is there anything at all bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? No. Perfectly fine. A bit of stiffness sometimes, after gardening, but nothing a good warm bath doesn't fix. Honestly, Doctor, I think Omar worries too much. He reads things on the internet, you know how people are. It gives him… ideas. I’m a teacher, I deal with young minds all day, I don’t need someone on the internet telling me how to live my life. Or plan for the end of it, for that matter. Is this something I have to do?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Chilla, you absolutely do not have to do anything you don’t want to. It’s entirely your decision. However, it’s common practice to discuss these things, especially as patients reach middle age. It's about ensuring your preferences are respected should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. Gardening, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I have a small rose garden. It’s a passion, really. Keeps me grounded. Though, it’s becoming rather difficult to find good help these days. Everyone wants so much money for so little work. But that's beside the point. This form… it's about medical things, isn't it? What exactly would I be agreeing to? I'm not keen on giving anyone permission to… to pull the plug, if you understand my meaning. Omar keeps talking about quality of life, but frankly, I think that's a very subjective concept.
DOCTOR: It is about medical things, yes. And you are right to be cautious. These forms aren't about "pulling the plug," as you put it. They’re about making sure your doctors know what kind of treatment you want if you were seriously ill and unable to tell us yourself. For example, would you want to be kept alive by machines, even if there was no hope of recovery?
PATIENT: Machines? Heavens, no. Absolutely not. I have seen what those machines do to people. It’s not living, it’s… existing. A shell. Omar, of course, thinks it’s better to cling to life at all costs. He's a very… optimistic man. But I believe there’s a dignity to letting nature take its course. Though, I suppose if it's a simple thing, like a broken arm, it's not so important. Is this form for everything, or just… extreme cases? And who even gets to see it? I certainly don’t want just anyone poking around my personal medical decisions.
DOCTOR: It’s for more serious situations, yes. Things like a severe illness, a coma, or an accident where you couldn’t communicate. And you're right to ask about who sees it. It's kept in your medical record, accessible only to your healthcare team – doctors, nurses, and, if you designate them, your family members. Before we proceed further, perhaps we should just do a quick check-up, just to establish a baseline. It’s been a while since you’ve been seen, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I suppose a quick check-up is… sensible. Though, I assure you, I'm perfectly fine. Omar will be thrilled. He always insists on unnecessary tests. But alright, go ahead. I have a meeting at two, so please be quick. It’s a faculty meeting, and those are never short. Honestly, sometimes I think my students are easier to manage than the other teachers. But, yes, go ahead. What will you be doing? Blood pressure, I presume? And listening to my heart? It's always been quite strong, you know. Very regular.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs are standard. We’ll also check your temperature, pulse, and do a brief physical exam – just to get a general overview. And I’ll ask a few routine questions about your medical history, allergies, and any medications you might be taking. It won’t take long. First, let’s start with your weight and height. Could you step on the scale, please?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… awkward. I haven't weighed myself in years. Omar has a scale, but I prefer not to. It’s… a sensitive subject. But alright. Don’t tell me a number, if you can avoid it. Just… let’s get this over with. It's probably not accurate anyway. The scale is old.
DOCTOR: Very well. 137 pounds and 199 centimeters. And just to confirm, you're 44 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Forty-four. Though I feel much younger, thank you very much. And quite tall, if I may say so myself. It’s a family trait. My father was even taller. But let's move on, shall we? I have that meeting, and I wouldn't want to be late. Honestly, the paperwork alone is probably taking longer than any actual examination. Is there anything else you need to measure? I'm quite sure everything else is perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Just a few more quick things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and perhaps take a quick look in your ears and throat. It’s just standard procedure, Ms. Chilla. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be gentle. I dislike having things poked and prodded. And do try not to take too long. I have a feeling this meeting will be… difficult. The new curriculum is causing quite a stir, you see. Everyone has an opinion, and none of them agree. Honestly, sometimes I miss the quiet of the classroom. Go ahead then. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing a slight… murmur. It’s quite faint, but present. And your respiratory rate is a little elevated. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, never. Perhaps I was simply anxious about the meeting. Or the examination, for that matter. It's all rather… unsettling. A murmur? That sounds… ominous. Omar will have a field day with that. He always says I should see a specialist for everything. Is it serious? Honestly, Doctor, you're making me quite nervous now. Perhaps I should just skip the Advance Directive and go straight to a cardiology appointment.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Chilla, but it warrants further investigation. A murmur can have many causes, some benign, some requiring treatment. It’s best to be thorough. I recommend a simple echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart. It’s non-invasive and will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. And I’ll also order a routine blood test to check your overall health. Before we discuss the Advance Directive any further, let’s get these tests done and have a better understanding of your current condition. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram… and blood tests. Of course. Omar will be absolutely thrilled. He’s been saying I need a full check-up for years. Honestly, sometimes I think he enjoys taking me to doctors. It’s… a hobby for him. Alright. Fine. Do what you think is necessary. But please, don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have a faculty meeting, and a life to lead, you know. And… perhaps we should postpone the Advance Directive discussion until after we have a clearer picture of… whatever is going on with my heart. Yes, that sounds much more sensible. Let’s just focus on the tests for now. Can I at least get a referral to a cardiologist Omar approves of? He has very strong opinions on these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez. He’s a highly-regarded cardiologist, and I believe he’ll be a good fit. And the lab results should be back within a week. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them, and your options. For now, I'd recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough for now. Frankly, I’m rather overwhelmed. Just the referral and the lab order, please. And… perhaps a note explaining why I’m avoiding strenuous activity. Omar likes documentation. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Though, I still maintain that this is all rather unnecessary. But Omar will be pleased. Very pleased. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse prepare the referral and lab order. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Chilla.
