DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. I'm Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need to get a card so I can drive for… well, for a ride-share service. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, I believe? I just want to get it done quickly if possible, I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver’s medical card, yes. That requires a more comprehensive examination than a typical check-up. It's not a matter of simply getting it done quickly, Ms. Sciarrotta, it’s ensuring you meet the federal standards for safe operation of a vehicle while transporting passengers. However, we can certainly work through it efficiently. First, let's clarify—are you applying to drive for Uber, Lyft, or another service?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, I understand about the safety part, of course. It’s just… things are a little tight right now, financially. Lyft, I think. Yes, definitely Lyft. I signed up online, and they said I needed this card from a doctor. Do you need a lot of information about them specifically?
DOCTOR: No, the specific ride-share company isn't crucial for my part of the process, Ms. Sciarrotta. The Department of Transportation standards are what matter. Alright. To begin, I’ll need to go through your medical history. I see here you’re 70 years old… have you had a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Yamamoto, over on Elm Street. Though… he retired last year, actually. I haven’t really found another one yet. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully, so haven’t needed to bother much with doctors. I go for my yearly Medicare check-ups, of course, but that’s about it. Everything usually goes smoothly.
DOCTOR: No regular physician since Dr. Yamamoto’s retirement… alright. And the yearly Medicare check-ups are good to know, though those aren’t as detailed as what’s required for a commercial driver’s license. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or any problems with your lungs or kidneys?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure when I was younger, but it went away after I started working outdoors more. My doctor said it was just stress, mostly. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed, maybe… twenty years ago? But other than that, I’ve been very lucky. I used to chop wood, you see. Good exercise, that was. Still do a little bit, when I can. Do you need the exact date of the gallbladder removal? I think Dr. Yamamoto had it in his records.
DOCTOR: We can certainly try to obtain records from Dr. Yamamoto, Ms. Sciarrotta, though that can take time. For now, approximately twenty years ago is sufficient. Now, about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily vitamin, Doctor. A basic multivitamin. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just when I really need it, though. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I don't like the way some of those pills make you feel. Do you want to know the dosage for the ibuprofen? I usually take two, if needed.
DOCTOR: Daily multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed… dosage noted. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything, and I haven't been stung by a bee in… well, ever, I think. My late husband was allergic to peanuts, but that wasn’t me. Honestly, I’m quite fortunate, health-wise. I think all the fresh air from working with the logs has helped. Is this getting us closer to finishing? I have appointments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are progressing, Ms. Sciarrotta, though a complete medical assessment takes time, regardless of your perceived good health. It is a matter of due diligence for safety, as I’ve mentioned. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 95, and she was as healthy as a horse until the very end. My father… he had a bit of a weak heart, I think. He smoked a lot, unfortunately. And my brother, he had high cholesterol, I believe. But other than that, not much that I can recall. They weren’t really the type to talk about their ailments much, you see. It was a different generation. I don’t want to hold things up, Doctor, if you need more details. Perhaps Dr. Yamamoto has a better record of it all?
DOCTOR: It’s becoming clear obtaining records from Dr. Yamamoto is essential. However, to proceed efficiently, let's attempt a brief review of systems. Just a quick series of questions. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My eyesight’s a little blurry up close, but it always has been. I wear reading glasses for close work. And my hearing… well, it’s not what it used to be, but I can usually hear alright. My husband used to say I could hear a pin drop, but he was always teasing me. I’ve noticed a bit of ringing in my ears sometimes, especially when it’s quiet. Is that a problem? I don't know if that’s important. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears noted. Alright. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a bit. I used to haul logs all day, remember? I was pretty strong. I did have a cough last winter, but that was just a cold, I think. A bad cold, but it went away. I didn’t bother going to the doctor for it. I just took some over-the-counter medicine and rested. Are we getting closer now, Doctor? I really do need to be going soon. I promised my granddaughter I’d help her with something this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, I understand your time is valuable, but completing this examination is crucial. I need to assess your physical health to determine if you meet the requirements for a commercial driver’s license. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. I'll try to relax. I do get a little anxious at the doctor, you know. It’s not my favorite place to be. But I appreciate you trying to hurry things along. Is my blood pressure usually high at the doctor’s office? My husband used to say I always got nervous.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated—142/88. It could be due to anxiety, as you mentioned. However, we need to repeat it after a few minutes of rest. Your heart rate is 78, regular rhythm. Lung sounds are clear, but somewhat diminished. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Balance appears stable. Coordination is good. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Vision is 20/30 in both eyes, corrected with glasses. Alright, Ms. Sciarrotta. Now, I'd like to check your range of motion in your neck, shoulders, and back. Can you rotate your head slowly from side to side?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There… is that alright? It feels a little stiff sometimes, I must admit. I did pull a muscle lifting some logs a few months ago, nothing serious. I just rubbed some ointment on it. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it’s not as flexible as it used to be, that's for sure. I suppose that comes with age. Is this enough? I’m a little worried I’m holding up your other patients.
DOCTOR: Your range of motion is somewhat limited, especially in forward flexion. Some crepitus is present. It’s not necessarily alarming, but it warrants notation. Spinal tenderness is minimal. No edema noted in extremities. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Sciarrotta. Based on this preliminary examination, I have a few concerns. Your slightly elevated blood pressure, limited range of motion, and diminished lung sounds require further investigation. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. I also suggest a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to evaluate your heart health.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I was hoping I could just get the card and be done with it. Is that absolutely necessary? I feel fine, mostly. I mean, I'm a little stiff, but that's just from working. And I get a bit anxious at the doctor’s, which probably explains the blood pressure. Do you think it would be alright if I just… tried driving for a bit and see how it goes? I really need this job.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, with all due respect, this is not a matter of simply “trying” to see if you can manage. A commercial driver's license carries a significant responsibility – the safety of yourself and others. We are legally and ethically obligated to ensure you meet the DOT standards. I understand your financial concerns, but the potential consequences of operating a vehicle while not meeting these standards are far greater. We cannot compromise safety. I strongly advise against attempting to drive before completing these tests and receiving clearance from a cardiologist. I can provide you with information about financial assistance programs that may help cover the cost of these tests. Furthermore, I will not sign off on your medical card until I have received satisfactory results from these investigations. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. It's just... a lot to take in. And it will take time, won't it? I suppose I have no choice, then. Could you at least give me a list of those tests, and where I can get them done? And that information about the financial assistance? I really did hope this would be simpler.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I'll have my assistant print out a list of the required tests and the locations of several reputable facilities nearby. She will also provide information regarding financial assistance programs. Here is the list: Complete Blood Count , Basic Metabolic Panel , Electrocardiogram , and Chest X-ray. I also recommend scheduling a consultation with a cardiologist. I have a few referrals I can provide. I understand this is not ideal, Ms. Sciarrotta, but it is a necessary step. We need to ensure your safety, and the safety of others. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you have completed these tests, so we can review the results. Do you have any further questions at this time?
