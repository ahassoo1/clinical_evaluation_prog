DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife, she want... baby. We old now, you know? She say maybe need help. I not sure what help is, but she very happy about this visit. I think she worry a little.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your wife would like to explore options for starting a family, and she’s hoping I can help understand what those might be. That’s perfectly alright. It’s wonderful that you’re both discussing this together. Just to clarify, Mr. Carlotta, when you say “baby,” are you and your wife hoping to conceive a child?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Conceive… that the word, yes! A child. We have… how you say… grown children, already. But we want one more. My wife, she very strong woman, but… time pass, you know? She think maybe harder now. I just want to make her happy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s very thoughtful of you to support your wife’s wishes, and it’s not uncommon to consider family planning later in life. To help me understand the situation better, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask a few questions, if that’s alright with you. We'll start with some general health information, and then I’ll ask about your wife’s medical history specifically. First, could you tell me a little about your wife’s overall health?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. My wife… she good health, mostly. She walk every day, you know? Very strong legs. Sometimes her back, she complain a little, but she work hard all her life. She eat good food, mostly. We try to eat healthy. She go to doctor for check-up every year… I think. She tell me she do. I… I forget sometimes. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's very common to forget details, and it’s wonderful that she generally maintains good health and has regular check-ups. Knowing she’s proactive about her health is a good sign. Regarding her back pain, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm... back pain. She say is old age, you know? She carry many things in her life. Work hard, take care of family. It come and go. Not all the time. Sometimes after she garden, she complain more. She use… what you call… cream on it. And take little pills, sometimes. Nothing strong, she say. Just for the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain seems to be related to activity and she manages it with topical creams and over-the-counter pain relievers. That’s good she’s finding ways to cope. Now, I’d like to ask about any medical conditions your wife has been diagnosed with, if she remembers. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or any problems with her heart, kidneys, or thyroid. Does any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Hmm... High… blood pressure. She say the doctor talk about that one time. She say need watch the salt. She try to eat less salt. But she like to cook, you know? And she like flavor! I think she take little pill for that too, sometimes. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Heart… no. She strong heart, my wife! She always busy. Kidney… I don’t know about kidney. Thyroid… what is thyroid? I forget. So many things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Carlotta. Don’t worry about remembering everything. It sounds like she’s been managing her blood pressure with dietary changes and medication, which is good. The thyroid is a gland in the neck that controls metabolism. We'll get all of this sorted out. Now, has your wife ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. She had her babies, of course. That is surgery, yes? But other than that… I think… years ago, when we first come to this country, she had her… appendix out. Very sick, she was. I remember that. And… maybe her gallbladder? I think she tell me that one time. But it was long time ago. I… I get confused sometimes with all the years. It all blend together.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good you remember those details. So, she had a C-section for the babies, an appendectomy, and possibly a gallbladder removal. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications your wife is currently taking, including any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medication… she take the blood pressure pill, yes? The little white one. And sometimes, for the pain, she take… ibuprofen, I think? The red one. And… she like vitamins. She take one for the bones, because she old now. And… something for the eyes? She say good for the eyes. I don’t know the names. She buy them at the store. So many bottles! I not good with the names. She take them every morning with her breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so she’s taking a medication for high blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for pain, a bone supplement, and a vitamin for her eyes. That's helpful to know. Now, does your wife have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. She eat everything. She like spicy food! She never say she allergic to anything. She never get rash or… what you call… trouble breathing. No, I don’t think she have allergies. She strong woman, my wife! She not get sick easy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to some questions about your family history, I'd like to quickly check her height and weight, and take her blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. She trust you. I trust you too. She say is important to check all these things. I just want to make her happy. You check what you need. I sit here, quiet. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Carlotta. Yes, you can sit quietly, and I’ll just take a few measurements. It will only take a moment. Okay, her height is 164 centimeters and her weight is 96 kilograms. Her blood pressure is a little elevated at 142 over 88. We'll need to discuss that further. Now, I’d like to ask about your and your wife's family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in either of your families, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm... family history. That is hard. My family… we from Somalia, you know? Long time ago. We not see doctor much. People get sick, they… they just get sick. We not have fancy medicine. Her family… they from… I forget. Somewhere in… Africa too, I think. They mostly farmers. I think… her mother, she had trouble with her heart. But I not sure. She die long time ago. I not remember much about her. It all… blurry. Is that okay? I not good with remembering.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Family history can be difficult to recall, especially if access to medical care was limited. It’s very common not to have detailed information. Knowing that her mother had heart trouble is helpful, though. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your wife's lifestyle. Does she smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no! My wife is good woman. She not smoke. Never smoke. She not drink alcohol either. She say it is bad for the body. And… no, no drugs. She work hard all her life. She need her strength! She drink tea, sometimes. But just tea. Very strong tea! But not coffee. She say coffee make her nervous. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. So, she doesn’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. Just tea, which is perfectly fine. Now, one final question about her lifestyle. Could you describe a typical day for her?
PATIENT: Hmm... typical day. She wake up early, very early! She pray, then she make breakfast for me. She garden most of the day. She grow vegetables, very beautiful vegetables! She cook dinner, then we watch the news. Sometimes we visit family. She always busy, always doing something. She very strong woman, I tell you! She never rest. She like to help others too. Always helping others. Is that okay? She good woman.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life. She is a remarkable woman, Mr. Carlotta. Okay, I think I have enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me, your wife is generally in good health, but her blood pressure is a little elevated. Given her age and desire to conceive, there are a few things we need to consider. First, we need to confirm her medical history with her primary care physician. I can request her records, or she can bring them to our next appointment. Second, we need to discuss the risks and benefits of pregnancy at her age. It’s important to be realistic about the potential challenges. And third, we may need to run some tests to assess her overall health and fertility. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That sound good. You check with her doctor, that is good. I trust you. We want to make sure she is healthy, very healthy. We want baby, but we want her to be okay too. Tests… yes, do the tests. Whatever you need. We will do whatever you need. I just want to make her happy. Is that okay? Just make her happy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Carlotta. It's very reassuring to know you're both so committed to her health and well-being. Okay, I will request her medical records from her primary care physician. In the meantime, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and create a plan. Would next week work for you?
PATIENT: Next week is okay. Whatever work for you. She go to doctor on Tuesday, maybe Wednesday is good? She tell me Tuesday is busy. She always busy. Wednesday… yes, Wednesday is good. Tell me what time. I come with her. We come together. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Wednesday at 2:00 PM works perfectly. And absolutely, please do come with her. It’s always helpful to have both of you present. I will have my staff schedule the appointment and let you know if there are any forms you need to bring. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: No, no. I think that is all. You very helpful, Doctor. You very kind. Thank you for listening to old man like me. And thank you for taking care of my wife. She is very important to me. You make her happy, and that make me happy.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Mr. Carlotta. It’s clear how much you care for your wife, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I look forward to seeing both of you on Wednesday.
