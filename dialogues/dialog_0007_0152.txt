DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me my bloodwork came back with something about high cholesterol. I don’t really know what that means, exactly. I just got a letter saying I should come talk to you about it. It's a bit worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly normal to be worried when you get a letter like that. We'll definitely get to the bottom of this and figure out what’s going on. Let’s talk a little bit about your history first. Have you been diagnosed with high cholesterol before, or is this the first time you’re hearing about it?
PATIENT: No, never. This is completely new to me. I've always felt pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat okay, I think… not much fast food. I walk the dog every day, usually about a mile. I don’t have any family history that I know of, either, with heart trouble or anything like that. My mother was very healthy, lived to be 88.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. A family history of good health is always a positive. And walking a mile a day is excellent! Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by "eat okay"?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I cook most nights, usually chicken or fish with vegetables. I like potatoes a lot, maybe a bit too much. And I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner most evenings. Sometimes I have cheese and crackers as a snack, and I love a good piece of apple pie if I can get my hands on one. I don't drink soda, and I try to avoid sugary things, but I do like a little chocolate after dinner sometimes. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m listing everything I eat now!
DOCTOR: It is helpful, very! Don't worry about listing everything – it gives me a better picture. Okay. And do you take any vitamins or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, the basic kind you get at the drugstore. I've been taking it for… oh, goodness, probably ten years now? My sister said it was a good idea, and I just stuck with it. Nothing else, no special pills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin. That's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, thankfully! Not to any food, and not to any medicine I’ve ever taken. I’ve been lucky that way. Penicillin, aspirin… I've had them all and never had a problem. I can even handle cats, and I’m a bit sensitive to dust usually.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very helpful. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to understand what this high cholesterol means, you know? It’s a bit unsettling, finding this out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Okay, blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal there. Okay, everything sounds and feels good physically, which is reassuring. Now, let’s look at those bloodwork results a little closer…
PATIENT: Okay, good. I’m glad to hear it sounds good, even if the blood pressure is a bit high. What exactly is high cholesterol, though? Is it something I can fix with diet? And what about walking? Does that help? My sister said something about "good" and "bad" cholesterol… is that true? I feel a bit lost with all this talk of numbers and types.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and a very common one! You're right to feel a little lost, there’s a lot of information. Essentially, cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs to build healthy cells. But when you have too much of a certain type in your blood, it can build up and increase your risk of heart disease. There are different types of cholesterol. You mentioned “good” and “bad” cholesterol, and you’re exactly right. LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” one – can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries. HDL cholesterol – the “good” one – helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Your LDL is 160, which is higher than we like to see – ideally, we want that under 100. Your HDL is 45, which is… okay, but we’d like to see it higher, above 60. Your total cholesterol is 240, which is also a bit elevated. Now, to answer your question about diet and walking – absolutely! Both can help. Diet plays a huge role. Reducing saturated and trans fats, and increasing fiber intake can lower your LDL. And walking, like you're doing, is excellent for raising your HDL. It's great you're already doing that!
PATIENT: Okay, so the numbers are… not ideal. But not terrible either? So, diet and walking can help lower the bad numbers and raise the good ones. That's encouraging. What kind of diet, though? Should I cut out all fat completely? That seems… hard. And my apple pie! Is there anything I can do to still enjoy a little pie now and then? I really appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Doctor. It's much less scary when I understand what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're right, it’s not terrible! And you're also right to ask about the details. Cutting out all fat completely isn’t realistic or necessary. In fact, some fats are good for you! We want to focus on limiting saturated and trans fats. Those are mostly found in things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. This handout has a more detailed list. As for your apple pie... moderation is key. Enjoying a small slice occasionally isn't going to derail your progress. It's more about making healthy choices most of the time. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. And remember, walking is doing wonders for you! We can start with some dietary changes and continue your walking routine. We'll recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see how things are progressing. If those changes aren’t enough, we can discuss medication options, but let's try lifestyle adjustments first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very sensible plan, Doctor. Three months sounds good. I can definitely work on cutting down on the red meat and fried foods. And maybe a slightly smaller slice of pie! This is helpful, thank you. It's reassuring to know there are things I can do. And I'm glad walking is a good thing, because I enjoy that. So, no special pills right away? Just try to eat better and keep walking?
DOCTOR: Exactly! No special pills right away. Let’s focus on the lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – for now. We'll monitor your progress with another blood test in three months and see where we stand. If we don't see enough improvement, we can discuss other options then. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. You've explained it all so clearly, and I feel much less worried. Thank you for being so patient and helpful. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise! I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Just focus on eating a healthy diet and continuing your walking routine. If you have any questions between now and your follow-up appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day! .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you Doctor, and thank you again for all your help. Have a good day yourself!
