DOCTOR: “Bula! And good morning to you. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today, Mrs. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get a card… a driver’s medical card, I think? For ride-sharing. I drive a little for extra money, and they need one now, apparently. It’s… a bit of a hassle, honestly. I just want to get it over with if we can.
DOCTOR: “Good morning, San. Wonderful to meet you too. And yes, those medical cards can be a bit of a process! No worries, we'll get through it together. So, it sounds like you need a Commercial Driver Medical Card, often called a DOT physical. To make sure everything is okay for you to drive safely, I’ll need to ask a few questions about your health history and do a quick physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. The quicker the better, really. I don't have any… major problems, if that helps. Just getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, and I understand wanting to be efficient. ‘Just getting older’ is a perfectly valid reason to want a check-up! Let's start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any ongoing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else that a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes, a few years ago. But it's been… well, managed. With pills, you know? And… arthritis in my knees, it's what makes it hard to walk sometimes. Nothing else comes to mind immediately. I had a gallbladder removed years and years ago, but that’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s good to know, San. High blood pressure that’s managed is excellent. And arthritis in the knees – that definitely fits with getting older. We'll want to make sure that's stable too. And yes, a history of gallbladder removal is helpful to have. So, just to confirm, you are currently taking medication for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Amlodipine, I think it’s called. Five milligrams every morning. I’ve been on it for… oh, maybe seven or eight years now? I try to remember to take it with my breakfast, but sometimes… well, you know.
DOCTOR: “No worries at all, San, we all have those days! Amlodipine 5mg daily – good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband – well, my ex-husband – used to tease me about it. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though I do get a bit of a sniffle in the springtime, but that’s just the pollen, I think.
DOCTOR: “Good to know about the springtime sniffles – that sounds like seasonal allergies then. Now, San, have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, that was the only one. A long time ago, when I was still living in Japan. Just the gallbladder. It wasn’t a big deal, really. They just took it out and sent me home. No problems after that.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh… well, my son lives in California. Doesn’t call much. And… my ex-husband passed away a few years ago. As for medical history… my mother had… some kind of heart trouble when she was older, I think. But I don’t remember the details. She lived a long life, though. Into her nineties.
DOCTOR: “Thank you for sharing that, San. It’s helpful to know. And it’s wonderful that your mother lived a long life. Okay, just a few more questions before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband… he smoked, but I always told him it was a terrible habit. I’ve always been very careful about my health.
DOCTOR: “That’s excellent, San. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. A glass, maybe two, a couple of times a week. Nothing more. It helps me relax, you know?
DOCTOR: “Perfectly reasonable, San. Now, before we do the physical exam, do you have any current symptoms – anything that’s bothering you today, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, not really. My knees ache a bit, like always, but that's just getting old. And sometimes I feel a little tired, but who doesn't? I think that's about it. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s reassuring to hear, San. So, just to clarify, no chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. Everything seems… normal. I just want to get this card so I can keep driving and earn a little extra money, you know?
DOCTOR: “Okay, wonderful. It sounds like you’re in pretty good shape then, San. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. I’ll also check your reflexes and strength, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, let’s just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: “Okay, San. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142 over 88. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your reflexes and strength are normal. Everything else looks good so far. Now, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that okay? I sometimes feel a bit unsteady on my feet.
DOCTOR: “Yes, thank you, San. That’s helpful. I noticed you were a little unsteady, and that’s something we should note. Your gait is slightly wide-based, and you seem to require a bit of effort to maintain balance. I want to check your feet and ankles. There is some mild swelling in your ankles and your arches are a little flattened. Now, I’m going to check your vision and hearing. Could you please cover your left eye and read the letters on this chart?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I can see… uh, the top line, and most of the second line… but the ones below are blurry. It's not as good as it used to be, I tell you.
DOCTOR: “Okay, thank you, San. Your vision is 20/30 in your right eye. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to place these headphones over your ears and ask you to tell me when you hear a tone. You have some mild hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, in both ears. Now, just a few more quick neurological checks. Your cranial nerves are intact and your reflexes are normal. However, you do have some difficulty with balance. Overall, San, everything looks reasonably good, but there are a few things we need to consider before we can issue a DOT medical card. “
PATIENT: Oh dear. What things? What do I need to do? I just want to drive, I don't want any trouble.
DOCTOR: “Okay, San, let's not worry just yet. The things I'm concerned about are your slightly elevated blood pressure, the mild swelling in your ankles, your difficulty with balance, and some hearing loss. These aren't necessarily deal-breakers, but they require further evaluation. “Your blood pressure could be managed with medication adjustments or lifestyle changes. The swelling in your ankles could indicate a circulatory issue. The difficulty with balance and hearing loss could affect your reaction time and ability to drive safely. “To get a clearer picture, I’d like you to see a cardiologist to evaluate the swelling and circulatory system. I also recommend an audiogram for a more detailed hearing assessment. And we may want to consider a referral to a neurologist, but let’s start with the cardiologist and audiologist first. “Until we have those evaluations, I’m not able to issue a DOT medical card. It’s for your safety and the safety of others. “Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot. A cardiologist… and an audiologist… So, I can’t drive at all until I see those doctors? What about just… a little bit? I need to earn money, you know? I don't think I can afford to wait a long time for appointments. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: “I understand your frustration, San, and I truly wish it weren’t necessary. Unfortunately, the DOT has very specific requirements for medical certification. Given your blood pressure, swelling, and balance issues, I can't ethically certify you to drive until we address those concerns. “Driving with these issues could put you and others at risk. I know you need to earn money, but safety has to come first. “I can help you find specialists who take your insurance and have quick appointment availability. I also have some resources for financial assistance with medical bills, if that would be helpful. “Let's focus on getting you scheduled with the cardiologist and audiologist as soon as possible. Depending on their findings, we may be able to get you back on the road sooner than you think. “I can write a referral for both specialists today. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please write the referrals. That would be… helpful. As quick as possible, please. And… could you write down the names and numbers of those financial assistance places too? Just in case. I just… I didn’t expect all of this.
DOCTOR: “Of course, San. Absolutely. I’m very sorry this is causing you stress. It’s better to be safe and thorough, though, and we’ll get through this together. “Here are the referrals for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a cardiologist, and Dr. Ben Carter, an audiologist. Their contact information is on the papers. I’ve also included a list of local organizations that may be able to assist with medical expenses. “I'll also send these documents to your primary care physician's office for their records. “Do you have any questions about the referrals or the financial assistance resources?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very patient. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or… can I go now?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. And you are absolutely free to go now. “Remember, please schedule those appointments as soon as possible. If you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting for your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. “I wish you all the best, San. And I hope we can get you back on the road safely soon.” “Take care, and have a good day.”
