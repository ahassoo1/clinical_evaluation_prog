DOCTOR: Good morning, Devin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, you say? Yeah, nice to meet you too. Um... this cough. It’s… bad. Been coughin’ up stuff. Red stuff. Not good, right? I don’t… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been a while. I smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing up red stuff is definitely something we need to look into. And yes, smoking is relevant. You’re right to bring that up. “A while” is a little vague – can you try to remember if it’s been days, weeks, or months?
PATIENT: Months, I think. Maybe… six months? It comes and goes, but lately it's been… more. Hard to say exactly. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know? I just want it to stop. It worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're getting it checked out. Six months is helpful, thank you. And it’s perfectly alright if you don't remember exact dates. Just getting a general timeframe is useful. Besides the red stuff, is there anything else you've noticed with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It mostly happens in the morning. When I first wake up. And… sometimes I get short of breath, even when I’m not doin’ much. Not all the time, but… yeah. Short of breath. Feels like I can’t get enough air. Does that make sense? I work dispatch, gotta talk on the phone a lot, so… it’s kinda important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Devin. Shortness of breath is important to note, especially with your job. And morning coughs can be telling. Okay, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you gotta do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got a shift starting soon. Dispatch doesn't run itself, you know. Gotta keep the power flowin’.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick as I can. It shouldn’t take long. Okay, take a few deep breaths for me, Devin. In and out… good. I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lower lungs, and a few crackles as well. Your oxygen saturation is currently at 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. I'm also noting a mild barrel chest and you are using accessory muscles to breathe. I’d like to get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: X-ray? Uh… barrel chest? Accessory muscles? What does all that mean? Is it… bad? 92%, you say? I don't… I don’t understand all this doctor talk. And honestly, I ain't too keen on radiation if I can avoid it. Can’t we just… give me somethin' for the cough? An inhaler, maybe? I just wanna get back to work. I really don't have time for a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I apologize for using medical terms without explaining them. A “barrel chest” means your chest is a bit wider than it should be, which can happen with lung issues. The “accessory muscles” I mentioned are the muscles in your neck that you're using to help you breathe – that indicates your lungs are working harder. 92% oxygen is a little low, and the wheezing and crackles I heard suggest some inflammation or blockage in your airways. I understand your concerns about radiation, and we can certainly discuss that. However, an X-ray is the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your lungs and rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or… other conditions. It's a quick procedure. I’m not comfortable prescribing an inhaler without knowing the cause of your cough. It could mask a more serious problem. I want to make sure we're treating the right thing. Would you be willing to go down to radiology now?
PATIENT: Ugh… this is a mess. Look, I'm a simple guy. Power flowin', phones workin'. That's what I do. I don’t need a whole bunch of tests and fancy words. But… pneumonia sounds bad. Really bad. Fine. Radiology. But make it quick, okay? And tell 'em to use… the least amount of radiation possible. I got a shift to get back to. And I need a note for my boss. Explainin' why I'm late. Dispatch is… particular.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll write a note for your boss. And I’ll tell the radiology technician to use the lowest radiation dose possible. They're very good about minimizing exposure. I’ll also have the nurse draw some blood to check for infection and your overall health. It’s a standard precaution with a cough like yours. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. Never really paid attention to that stuff. Just… avoid penicillin if you can, I think my mom said somethin’ about that when I was a kid. But honestly, I can’t really remember. I mostly just try to avoid gettin’ sick in the first place. It's hard enough keepin’ the lights on without bein’ laid up. Does that help? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. We will definitely avoid penicillin. Okay, let's get you down to radiology, then the lab for the blood work. The nurse will be with you shortly to guide you. After we get those results, we can discuss the next steps. If the X-ray shows anything concerning, we might need to consult a pulmonologist – a lung specialist. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist… more doctors… this is gettin’ out of hand. I guess. Whatever it takes to get back to work, I suppose. Just… please, keep it simple. I don't need a lot of explanations. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. I'm tired. And I really gotta go. Is there anything else? Can I just… go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go now. The nurse will come get you when she's ready. She will explain the blood draw process. I understand your frustration, and I will do my best to keep things as simple as possible. I'll have the nurse print a copy of these initial notes for you to take with you, so you have a record of everything we discussed. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. I want you to get better, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate… that. Just… don’t make me sit around all day waitin' for test results. .
