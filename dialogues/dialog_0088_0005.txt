DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am here today regarding… well, a bit of a change in my living situation. I’m looking into moving to a senior living facility, and they require a check-up beforehand, you see. Just to be certain I’m fit for it, and all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very responsible of you to get that checked out. A pre-placement physical is a good idea. So, just to clarify, you’re feeling generally well, but the facility requires an assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Perfectly well, as a matter of fact. I still bake every day – breads mostly, some pies when the berries are good. But they want to be sure I can manage alright, you understand. It’s a sensible precaution, I suppose. I wouldn’t want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re still so active. Baking is excellent! And yes, it absolutely is sensible of them. Okay, let’s go through a bit of your medical history then, just to get a good picture. Have you been seeing a regular doctor before me?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Abernathy, in town. A good woman, though she retired last year. I saw her for my yearly check-ups, and when I had a touch of the flu a few winters ago. Nothing serious, mind you. Mostly just kept up with my blood pressure, and such. I believe she sent my records to you already? I told her I was coming to see you.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull those up… Yes, I see Dr. Abernathy’s notes here. That’s very helpful. It looks like she was monitoring your blood pressure, and you did have a bout of influenza in 2023. Anything else you can recall about past illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A long time ago, when I was a young man, I broke my arm falling off a horse. A clean break, healed up just fine. And when I was a boy, I had the measles, like most children did back then. But other than that… no. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I’ve been fortunate, I think. I’ve always tried to eat well, and stay active. It’s the Lakota way, you know – to respect the body.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Staying active is key. And I appreciate you sharing that. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. I can eat anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, that I recall. She tried to give me everything when I was a boy – tonics, syrups… I tolerated it all. Though I didn’t always like it, mind you!
DOCTOR: That’s good news. And now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I take nothing at all. I've always preferred to let food be my medicine, as much as possible. A bit of ginger for an upset stomach, maybe, but nothing regularly. I find most of those pills just make you feel worse in the long run.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant health problems that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived a long life, into her nineties. She had a touch of arthritis in her later years, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father, he passed away when I was young, from pneumonia. But I don’t recall any other major illnesses in the family, truthfully. My grandparents… they lived simple lives, on the land. Didn’t see much of a doctor, if I recall correctly. They just… wore out, eventually. A peaceful passing, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And finally, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned, I still bake every day. Keeps me busy, and I enjoy it very much. I live alone, in my own home. It’s a small place, nothing fancy, but it's comfortable. I walk into town most days to get groceries, and I visit with friends at the community center a couple of times a week. Mostly just quiet activities – playing cards, sharing stories. I don't do much traveling anymore, my knees aren’t what they used to be. But I keep my mind active, and my hands busy. It’s a good life, a simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mr. Tkac. Alright, let’s just do a quick physical exam to get a baseline, and then we can discuss everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. I’m ready whenever you are. I haven’t had a good check-up in a while, so I appreciate your thoroughness. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just step up on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: There we are. Not as light as I used to be, I suspect! But still holding my own, I hope.
DOCTOR: 83 kilograms. That's perfectly fine, Mr. Tkac. And your height is 188 centimeters, according to Dr. Abernathy’s notes. Now, could you step back and let me listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good. Now, I’m just going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarming. We can keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. I’ve always had a bit of a tendency towards high blood pressure, if I recall correctly. Dr. Abernathy mentioned it as well. I try to watch my salt intake, but… a little seasoning never hurt anyone, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A little seasoning is fine in moderation, Mr. Tkac. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you just let your arms relax?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Relaxed as can be. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to quickly check your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks clear as well. A little bit of age-related wear and tear, but nothing concerning.
PATIENT: That’s a relief, Doctor. I haven’t had any trouble with my ears or throat, thankfully. My mother always said a cold was the worst thing you could get, so I always tried to stay bundled up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Everything sounds good. You’re in good general health for your age. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing that requires immediate intervention. We can monitor it and discuss lifestyle changes if needed. Overall, I think you’re perfectly fit to move into a senior living facility. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: That is very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don't believe I do, not at the moment. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time. It’s a comfort to know I’m in good enough shape for a change. I just want to be sure I’m not a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. And you certainly don't seem like you'd be a burden to anyone. You’re active, alert, and taking good care of yourself. I’ll send a copy of my findings to the senior living facility. Is there an address or fax number I should use?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Let me see… Here it is. The address is Meadowbrook Estates, 14 Oak Street, Willow Creek. And the fax number is 555-123-4567. They were very helpful in getting me this information.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I’ll send that over right away. I’ll also send a copy to Dr. Abernathy for her records. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is everything. You’ve been very kind, and very thorough. I feel much better now, knowing I’m in good enough condition for this next step. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day! .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I certainly will. And you have a wonderful day as well. May your work be peaceful.
