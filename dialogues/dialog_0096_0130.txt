DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor... Burlingham, right? Yes. Well, it's... my family. Lots of heart trouble on both sides. My mom, my dad, even my sister. I’m getting older, you know? Seventy-three. Just want to make sure I’m okay. Not looking for trouble, just... peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Right, peace of mind. Sensible. A family history like that is something to pay attention to. So, you haven't been experiencing any specific symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing bad. Sometimes my heart feels... fluttery. But it doesn’t last long. Maybe just when I drink too much coffee. Or climb the stairs too fast. It's hard to say. I don’t want to bother you with nothing, you know? Just… worried.
DOCTOR: "Nothing" is exactly what we're here to figure out, Mr. Schwer. Those “fluttery” feelings – palpitations, as we call them – even if they’re brief, are worth investigating with your history. Now, when you say "brief," how brief are we talking?
PATIENT: Uh... seconds, usually. Maybe five, ten seconds. Then it goes away. Like a fish jumping, then gone. Happens maybe once a month, sometimes not for a few months. It’s… hard to remember exactly. I don’t keep a list, Doctor. Just try not to scare me, okay?
DOCTOR: Right, not keeping a list. Understandable. Though it would be helpful. Okay. And besides the palpitations, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. I get tired easier. But I’m getting older, right? It’s probably just that. And my ankles swell up a little at the end of the day, especially if it’s hot. But I thought that was just the heat. I don't know. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles, fatigue...those could be connected, Mr. Schwer. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, years ago, my blood pressure was a little high. They gave me a pill, I took it for a while, then it went down. Doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And I had a bad knee. But that's just old sports injury.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, high blood pressure in the past, appendix removed, and a knee injury. Any surgeries besides the appendix?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the appendix when I was little. My wife... my ex-wife… she wanted me to get the knee fixed, but I didn't want to. Too much trouble. It gets a little stiff sometimes, that's all. Nothing I can't walk on.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, a long time ago, like I said. I don’t take anything now. Except for… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis. Just when it’s really bad. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Schwer. It all matters. Ibuprofen is good to know. Now, any allergies to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never been allergic to anything. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife used to say I ate anything. Sorry. Just rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Schwer. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom smoked, though. Terrible habit. No, Doctor. I don't smoke. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well… I used to. Played baseball when I was young. Now… I walk. Mostly just to the store and back. Sometimes I do a little gardening. But not much. My knee, you know? It doesn’t bend like it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history in more detail. You mentioned heart trouble on both sides. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, uh... My mom died from a heart attack when she was seventy-five. My dad, he had something… angina, I think? Chest pain. He took pills for it for years. My sister… she had a stroke last year. That’s why I’m so worried. It just seems like it’s everywhere in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, heart attack in your mother, angina in your father, and stroke in your sister. That is significant, Mr. Schwer. Now, just to be thorough, are you aware of any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my aunt had diabetes. My mom’s sister. And... my uncle, he had high cholesterol. Real high. That’s all I can think of right now. It was a big family, lots of people. Hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s helpful. Now, Mr. Schwer, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can I listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my knee, okay? It gets a little… grumpy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. And breathe normally. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s probably nothing, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. And your ankles do have some mild edema, as you mentioned. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh, that knee. Always stiff when I stand up. There. That’s better. What did you find? Is it bad? Is my heart really… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Your heart rate is regular, but a bit fast. The slight murmur I detected warrants further investigation, and the edema in your ankles, combined with your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure, is concerning enough to order some tests. I want to run an EKG, a basic blood panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. We’ll also need to do a chest X-ray to rule out anything else going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Will they… hurt? Will they tell me if I’m going to… you know? Is it something serious? My sister… the stroke…
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, try to remain calm. These are routine tests. The EKG is painless – we just attach some stickers to your chest. The blood work will involve a simple needle prick. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive. They won’t “tell you” anything definitive at this point. They’ll give us information. Information we can use to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The important thing is we’re being proactive. Your family history does put you at higher risk, and it's better to investigate now than to wait for something serious to happen. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG and chest X-ray. I’ll also write you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin – it can help prevent blood clots. Do you have any allergies to aspirin?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to aspirin. Just… I’m a little scared, Doctor. All this talk about tests and blood clots… it’s just a lot. My wife… she always took care of these things. I don’t… I don’t do well with doctors.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer. You are being perfectly fine, and I understand it can be stressful. But you are not alone in this. We'll go through the results together. The aspirin is simply a precaution - it won't cause any harm, and it can provide some added protection. Now, do you have any questions for me before I have the nurse come in?
PATIENT: Um… Will these tests take long? I have an appointment to get my hair cut on Friday. And… will they make me tired? I don't want to be too tired to… to do things. And… is it possible it’s just nothing?
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn’t take long - maybe an hour total. Fatigue is a possible side effect of the blood work, but it’s usually mild and temporary. As for whether it’s “just nothing” - yes, it’s possible. That’s what we’re trying to determine. Now, I’ll have the nurse come in and get started. Please try to relax and focus on breathing normally. Don't worry. We’ll get this sorted out. Nurse! Could you come in here, please?
PATIENT: Okay… Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just hope it’s nothing. Just hope…
