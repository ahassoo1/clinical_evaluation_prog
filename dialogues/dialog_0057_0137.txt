DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need me to… check with a doctor first. For make sure I am okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a medical evaluation to be approved for a senior living facility. That’s perfectly alright, we do those frequently. So, to start, can you tell me a bit more about why the facility requires a check-up?
PATIENT: They… they want to know I am not… too sick? And I can… take care of myself a little bit. I still cook, you know. And clean. But sometimes… hard. My husband, he helps. He is good man.
DOCTOR: Alright, that makes sense. They want to ensure you’re healthy enough to live there safely and independently, with some assistance when needed. That’s very responsible of them. So, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Can you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I have… the pressure, you know? The doctor told me. High blood pressure. I take the… the little white pill every morning. And… sometimes my knees hurt. Especially when it is cold. Is that… a condition? I don't know all the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, that’s good to know you’re already being treated for that. And knee pain, yes, that’s certainly something we can address. It's very common, especially as we get older. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: The little white one… I get it from the pharmacy. My husband, he picks it up. I think… Lisinopril? Is that right? Sometimes I forget the names. It has a long name. He knows everything about my pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril is correct. That’s good. And you said your husband helps manage your medications – that's wonderful. Now, besides the high blood pressure and knee pain, are there any other health problems you've been dealing with, even if they seem small?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I get… tired. Very tired. Even after sleeping. And… my stomach. It doesn't like everything I eat anymore. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes… other things. Not every day, but… often enough. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and stomach issues. Yes, those are definitely things we should talk about. Let's start with the fatigue. How long have you been feeling tired, and is it a constant tiredness or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Maybe… six months now? Some days I feel okay, I can do things. Other days… I just want to sit. And sleep. It is… hard to explain. It's not like being sick tired. More like… no energy. Even when I sleep good. My husband, he says I look tired too. He worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about six months of intermittent fatigue, not necessarily feeling sick, just a lack of energy even after rest. And your husband has noticed it as well. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your stomach issues. Can you describe what kind of pain you get, and what seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say. Sometimes it's a cramp, you know? Like… squeezing. Other times it's more… a burning. And… some foods make it worse. Spicy things, for sure. And… milk. I used to like milk, but now… no. It doesn't agree with me. And sometimes… other things happen. I don't like to talk about it. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly okay. You don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with. We can just say you’ve been experiencing some digestive discomfort, including cramping, burning, and sensitivity to certain foods like spicy items and milk. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements—like diarrhea, constipation, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Sometimes… I go too much. Very quickly. And… it's not always… solid. Sorry. Is that bad? My husband says it's probably the food. He tries to help me eat better. But I like my food. Even the spicy things.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, you're sharing important information with me, and I appreciate it. Frequent, loose stools are something we should investigate further. It could be related to your diet, or something else. Now, let's go over some other general health areas. Have you had any recent weight changes – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think I lost a little bit. Not much. Maybe… five pounds? But I don't weigh myself often. It makes me sad. My husband says I look good anyway. He is always nice. But my clothes… they feel a little loose. But it could be the summer heat. Everything is bigger in the summer. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible unintentional weight loss of around five pounds. It's good your husband is supportive. It’s helpful to be aware of changes like that, even if they seem small. Before we move on to your past medical history, can you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. My husband always tells me I should be careful, but I never have problems. Maybe a little bit of itching sometimes with mosquito bites, but that's all. Not a real allergy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Long time ago, when I was young, the doctor said I had… bronchitis? A bad cough. But that was many years ago. I was living in Honduras then. And... I had a surgery. On my… gallbladder, I think? My husband knows more about this. It was a long time ago. It didn't hurt much. I remember being very sleepy. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had bronchitis in the past and a gallbladder surgery. We’ll make a note of those. Do you remember approximately when you had the gallbladder surgery?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… a long, long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or more? I don’t know. Before we moved to this town. My husband, he remembers better. He keeps all the papers. I don't like to keep papers. They make a mess. But he said it was… a long time ago. Very long.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll note it as a gallbladder surgery approximately 20 years ago. And you said you were living in Honduras when you had the bronchitis. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother, she had… problems with her heart. She was very old. And my brother, he had… the sugar sickness? Diabetes, my husband calls it. And… my aunt, she had… a bad sickness. The cancer, I think. But they are all gone now. It was a long time ago. It's sad to think about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and cancer. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never. I don't like those things. My husband doesn't like them either. We are good people. We go to church. We drink water, and eat our food. Sometimes a little bit of coffee, but that's all. No smoking, no drinking. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That’s very good for your health. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the Lisinopril for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the little white pill. That's all. Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really hurt. A little bit of ibuprofen, I think? But not every day. Just when they ache. My husband buys it for me at the store. He knows what to get. I don't remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril for your blood pressure and ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They hurt sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/82. A little bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ooh, that hurts a little. See? That's why I take the ibuprofen sometimes. They are… creaky, you know? Like old doors. They make noises. There's a little swelling too, I think. My husband says so. He rubs them with a cream sometimes. It helps a little. But not much.
DOCTOR: I do notice some mild swelling and tenderness in both knees. There's a bit of crepitus, which is the crackling sound you described. I also see some mild redness. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems stable overall, but we'll need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on with your fatigue and stomach issues. Would you be okay with me ordering some lab tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. If it helps to find out what is wrong, then yes. I want to know what is wrong. And I want to feel better. My husband, he wants me to feel better too. He worries a lot. What kind of tests will you do? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt, just a little pinch when the phlebotomist draws the blood. We’ll do a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out thyroid issues, and a vitamin D level. These tests will give us a good starting point to understand your fatigue and digestive problems. Do you have any questions about the tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… where will I go to get the blood taken? And how long will it take? I have to go home and make dinner for my husband. He likes my cooking. I don’t want to be gone too long. Is there a place close by?
DOCTOR: There’s a lab right across the street, at the medical plaza. It's called "Rural Health Labs". I’m sending an order electronically right now. They should be expecting you. It will probably take about 30-45 minutes, including the wait time and the blood draw itself. They are open until 5:00 PM today. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Across the street is good. Not too far. 30-45 minutes, I can do that. My husband will be happy. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Now, I guess I should go get the blood taken? Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now. Just head over to Rural Health Labs, let them know you’re here for the blood work ordered by Dr. Sieh, and they’ll take care of you. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m confident we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I will go get the blood taken now.
