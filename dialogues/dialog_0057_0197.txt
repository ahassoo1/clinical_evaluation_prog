DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA. I’m Dr. Letitia Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. Or taxis. Something like that. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. I just want to be sure I’m allowed to keep doing what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're referring to a medical certificate or a driver’s medical evaluation form to ensure you’re fit to drive for ride-sharing or taxi services. That’s perfectly reasonable to want to get checked out. To help me complete the necessary form, I’ll need to ask you some questions about your overall health and driving history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ask away. I don’t have any secrets, and like I said, I want to make sure everything is alright. I’ve been driving for a long time, you know. Never had an accident, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about your safe driving record, Ms. Sciarotta. That's a great start! Let's start with your current medical history. Do you have any ongoing health conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, or anything else that requires regular medical care?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no problem. And I get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially when it’s cold. It doesn't stop me from driving, though. I take some over-the-counter pain relief when it flares up. Oh, and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for about ten years now. Does that all make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for letting me know. So, gallbladder removal in the past, some arthritis that's managed with over-the-counter medication, and well-controlled high blood pressure for the last ten years. Could you tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it every morning for… well, like I said, about ten years. My doctor, Dr. Tanaka, keeps a good track of everything. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. That's helpful. And you mentioned Dr. Tanaka is your primary care physician – excellent. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything! I’m pretty lucky that way. My daughter always jokes I have an iron stomach. Though, I don’t eat shellfish anymore. Just don’t care for it, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. And shellfish being a preference rather than an allergy is good information as well. Now, let’s talk about any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Are you having any problems with your vision, hearing, balance, or any pain or weakness that could affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Well, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as you can see. But I had my eyes checked just six months ago, and the doctor said they're stable. I can see the traffic lights and road signs just fine. My hearing is okay, too, I think. My daughter says I don't listen sometimes, but that’s just old age, isn't it? No dizziness or anything like that, and no pain or weakness. I feel pretty good, actually, for seventy years old.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sciarotta. Glasses are stable with a check six months ago, and no reported dizziness, weakness, or hearing issues. And daughters are always right, aren’t they?
PATIENT: You’re telling me! Now, have you had any changes in your medications lately? Or any recent hospitalizations or surgeries? Anything at all that your doctor might have treated in the last few months?
DOCTOR: No changes in medications, and no hospitalizations or surgeries recently. Everything has been pretty smooth, thankfully. I did have a bad cold last winter, but that was it. Nothing serious. Just a lot of tissues and hot tea.
PATIENT: Okay, no recent medication changes, hospitalizations, or surgeries, just a cold last winter. Good. Now, let's move on to your driving habits. About how many hours do you typically spend driving each week? And what kind of driving do you do – mostly city driving, highway driving, or a mix?
DOCTOR: About… oh, I’d say around twenty to thirty hours a week. It varies. Mostly city driving, picking up and dropping off passengers. Some highway driving if I get a longer fare, but not too much. I try to avoid rush hour, if I can. It’s stressful! I’m a pretty careful driver, I promise. I take all the back streets if it means a smoother ride.
PATIENT: Okay, 20 to 30 hours a week, mostly city driving with some highway. And you try to avoid rush hour. That’s good awareness. Have you received any moving violations in the past five years? Even a simple speeding ticket counts.
DOCTOR: No, none at all. Not in the last five years, or honestly, ever! I really pride myself on being a safe driver. I don’t speed, and I always signal. My passengers feel safe, and that’s important to me.
PATIENT: That's excellent, Ms. Sciarotta. A clean driving record is very reassuring. Finally, do you have any concerns at all about your ability to drive safely? Anything you've noticed that makes you question your driving skills, or anything that you're worried about?
DOCTOR: Hmm… no, not really. Honestly, the only thing is sometimes my hands get a little stiff in the cold, but I just take a few minutes to warm them up before I start driving. It doesn’t affect my control or anything. I just wanted to be sure everything was alright, you know?
PATIENT: Okay. No major concerns, just some stiffness in the hands that you manage. That's very good to know. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re in good shape to drive. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your vision, hearing, reflexes, and general coordination. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I was expecting that, actually. Go ahead, Doctor.
PATIENT: Great. If you could just follow me over here. We’ll start with your vision. Just read the letters on the chart when I ask, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay. Let's start with your right eye. Can you read the first line for me? Don't squint, just read what you can see.
DOCTOR: Okay… um… S…H…P…T…F. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. Good. Now let's try your left eye. Cover your right eye, please.
DOCTOR: Okay… S…H…P…T…F. Just like the other eye.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Your vision is a little blurry, but with glasses you are at 20/30, which is acceptable for driving. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see the lights flashing on the side. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds fine. Just let me know when to look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay. Look straight ahead at my nose. Don't move your eyes, and tell me when you see a light flash. Any light, even if it's faint.
DOCTOR: Okay… I’m looking straight ahead. I see a light… on the right… and now one on the left… and again on the right… I think that was it?
PATIENT: Okay, your peripheral vision is within normal limits. Good. Now, let's quickly check your reflexes. I'm just going to tap your knees with this little hammer.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, that feels a little strange.
PATIENT: Good, good reflexes. And finally, just a quick balance test. I want you to stand up and close your eyes. Hold that position for ten seconds. Are you comfortable doing that? I'm right here if you feel unsteady.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s okay. Alright… ten seconds… feeling a little wobbly… almost there… five more seconds… okay, I think that’s ten.
PATIENT: Good. A little unsteady, but manageable. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, based on the physical exam and your answers, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to continue driving. I'm going to complete the medical certification form for you. It might take me a few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
DOCTOR: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do all of those tests. It puts my mind at ease. I was a little nervous about it, to be honest.
PATIENT: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. It’s my job to make sure you’re safe, and a little nervousness is perfectly normal. Here you go. This is the completed medical certification form. You’ll need to submit this to the licensing authority. It should be straightforward, but let me know if you have any trouble. And drive safely! .
