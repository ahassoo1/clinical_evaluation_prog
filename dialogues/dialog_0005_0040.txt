DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s this pain in my side again. Comes and goes, you see. And… well, I seem to be getting more of those water infections too. It’s been happening quite a bit lately. The doctor before, he said something about my kidneys… something about lots of little pockets in them? I don’t quite recall the name of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, “pockets in your kidneys”… that sounds like diverticulosis, possibly. We’ll get to the bottom of that. And you're having more frequent urinary infections, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. More frequent. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. And it worries me, doctor. It feels like I’m always needing to go, and sometimes it burns when I do. I haven’t had a fever or anything, thankfully, but it’s just… a nuisance, really. A worrying nuisance.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, so no fever, just the frequent urination and burning sensation. And the pain in your side… where exactly is that located?
PATIENT: It's… here, doctor. On this side. Not right on my back, but more… around here, in my flank, I think that’s what they call it. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, other times it’s a sharper pain. It seems to get worse if I move around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your records here… Okay, I see some notes from Dr. Sharma about possible diverticulosis, as you mentioned, and a history of recurrent UTIs. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle, if you would. My old bones aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, I’m just going to press on your stomach here. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. I'm starting on the right side here... Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s a little tender there, doctor. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It’s… a bit uncomfortable, yes. Like a dull ache, you know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And on this side?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright on this side, doctor. Doesn’t bother me at all. It’s mostly just on the right, like I said. Though, sometimes I feel it a little higher up as well, around my back… but mostly right here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Deep breaths, please. Sounds normal so far. Now, given your history of UTIs, I'm going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture. That'll help us see if there's an active infection and what kind of bacteria is causing it. I also want to get a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. And finally, given your report of flank pain, I'm ordering a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out any other possible causes for the pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor, that sounds… thorough. A lot of tests, but if it helps to find out what’s going on, then yes, that’s alright. A CT scan… is that one of those machines where I have to lie flat? I don’t do so well with lying flat for long periods, my back… but I’ll manage. Just let me know how long it takes, alright? And the urine tests… are they just a simple sample?
DOCTOR: Yes, the CT scan involves lying flat, and it usually takes about 20-30 minutes. We can certainly discuss positioning to make you as comfortable as possible. We'll have a technician help you. And yes, the urine tests are just a simple sample - you'll be given a cup, and you'll just need to provide a small amount of urine. We’ll give you instructions on how to collect a clean catch sample. I'll have the lab draw blood as well, for the basic metabolic panel. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend you stay well hydrated. Drink plenty of water. And avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, doctor, I think I understand. Hydrate, avoid caffeine and alcohol… that sounds sensible. A CT scan, urine tests, blood work… alright. Just… when should I expect to hear back about the results? And will someone call me, or do I need to call the office? I’m not very good with these new computer systems for looking up results myself, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. We'll call you with the results, sir, within 48-72 hours. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process everything. The nurse will contact you directly with the findings. If you haven't heard anything by then, please don't hesitate to call the office and ask. Is there a specific number you'd prefer us to reach you at?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, doctor. That’s a relief to hear. My number is 555-123-4567. That’s the best number to reach me. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. 555-123-4567, noted. You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m happy to help. We'll get these tests ordered and get you some answers as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, chills, or blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I’ll make sure to drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine. And I’ll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. You take care, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll be in touch soon. .
