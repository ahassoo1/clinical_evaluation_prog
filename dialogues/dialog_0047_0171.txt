DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. It's... my nails. They just look off. Not good. I don't know why they look like this, but they do. And it worries me. A lot.
DOCTOR: “Off” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh. Hard to say. Just... different. They're not shiny like they used to be, and one of 'em... it's kinda thick. Not broken, just... bulgy. I don't paint 'em or nothin', so it’s not that. It just happened. And it's on my right hand, I think. Maybe. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to my hands. They're hands.
DOCTOR: Right hand, changes in appearance...and not due to nail polish. Okay. And how long have you noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, time... that's a hard one. A few weeks, maybe? It feels like longer, but honestly, everything kinda blends together these days. Not recently recently, but not months and months ago either. I just noticed it when I was… gardening, I think. Yes, gardening. And it looked wrong.
DOCTOR: Gardening…and it appeared then, or you noticed it while gardening?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is what I mean! I don't know. I was digging around, and my eye just… landed on it. It was there. Maybe it was already starting, and I just saw it then. Honestly, doctor, I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it's not what it used to be. It’s just a nail, right? Why is this so complicated?
DOCTOR: Well, changes in nails can be indicative of underlying issues, Ms. Thut. It's not simply "just a nail." Now, have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm. Let me see... They might be a little… red? Around the edges, maybe? But I work with dirt all the time. I'm a… ear doctor. Audiologist. So, my hands get dirty. Is that what you mean? It's probably just the dirt. I wash 'em, but… Maybe a little puffy too? It’s hard to tell. Everything feels puffy these days, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Redness and puffiness around the nail bed... Audiologist, frequent hand washing… Right. And have you experienced any pain or discomfort in or around the affected nail?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. It doesn't hurt. It's just… weird. A little itchy sometimes, maybe? But that could be the dryness. It's been hot, you know? And I don't bother with lotion. Too much fuss. Honestly, doctor, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. It's just a funny-looking nail. Can't you just… file it down or something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I assure you, I'm trying to determine if there's a medical reason for these changes. I'm going to need to examine your hands more closely. Please extend your right hand, palm up.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just be gentle, okay? I don't like people messing with my hands. It feels… invasive. And hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me take a look. Hmm. Yes, there is some thickening present, and the nail appears slightly discolored. The cuticle does appear inflamed. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! There! That hurts a little. See? Something is wrong. It’s not just my imagination. What is it? Is it… a fungus? I don't want a fungus. Those are… disgusting.
DOCTOR: Tenderness present upon palpation. Hmm. While it could be a fungal infection, that's not the only possibility. Given your occupation and the inflammation, it could also be paronychia – an infection of the nail fold. Or, less likely, it could be a sign of something else entirely. To be certain, I'd like to take a nail sample for lab analysis. It's a quick procedure, but it will give us a definitive answer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A sample? You want to scrape my nail? No! Absolutely not! That sounds awful. And what if it hurts? I don’t do pain, doctor. I really, really don’t. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A cream or something? I'll just wash my hands more carefully. And wear gloves when I'm gardening. Problem solved. No scraping.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your apprehension, but without a proper diagnosis, I can’t recommend appropriate treatment. A cream won’t address the underlying cause, and it could even worsen the condition. Frankly, avoiding a simple nail sample based on a fear of discomfort is not in your best interest. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. I can refer you to a dermatologist, if you'd prefer, but they will likely request the same test.
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Ugh, more doctors? This is ridiculous. It’s just a nail, doctor! Fine. Fine. But be quick about it. And gentle. Very gentle. I don’t want a big fuss. And no needles! Definitely no needles. Is that clear? Just get it over with. But I'm warning you, if it hurts, I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. No needles, I assure you. It’s a sterile procedure involving a small scraping of the nail. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lean forward, and I'll explain the process as I go. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Now, just relax.
PATIENT: .
