DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if we can get right to those? I have a pretty tight schedule today.
DOCTOR: Of course. Though, for proper context, it’s always beneficial to briefly discuss why we ordered the tests in the first place. It helps to understand the full picture, even with results in hand. But, if you insist on jumping straight to it… very well. Let's see… you came in two weeks ago complaining of fatigue and some muscle aches, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Fatigue mostly, and feeling generally run-down. Honestly, I figured it was just stress, but my boss made me come in and get checked out. So, yeah, results?
DOCTOR: Right. Your complete blood count came back… within normal limits. Your thyroid panel was also unremarkable. Vitamin D is slightly low, but not critically so. Electrolytes are normal. No signs of infection. Essentially, everything looks perfectly fine. Which, frankly, is… frustrating. You say you've been feeling generally run-down. Can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Quantify? Um… like, I’m tired all the time. Even after a full eight hours of sleep, I still feel like I could nap. And it’s not just sleepy, it’s like… heavy. Does that make sense? And the muscle aches come and go, mostly in my legs and back. Nothing major, just… annoying. It’s been going on for a couple months, at least.
DOCTOR: “Heavy,” yes, I understand. Chronic fatigue is… a common complaint. And often, difficult to pinpoint. You mentioned this has been going on for a couple of months. Have there been any changes in your lifestyle during that time?
PATIENT: Not really. Work’s been the same – logistics, as you can see on the form – pretty demanding, always deadlines. I've been trying to go to the gym a couple times a week, but honestly, with the fatigue, it's been hard to keep it up. No major life changes, no new stressors that I can think of. Same diet, same sleep schedule, as much as work allows. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’re experiencing muscle aches in your legs and back. Are they related to exercise, or do they occur even when you haven’t been physically active?
PATIENT: Mostly when I haven’t been active, actually. Like, if I sit at my desk for too long, they start to ache. And sometimes they’re there even when I wake up. Not crippling pain, just… a dull ache. It’s more irritating than anything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Given your normal lab results and the pattern of your symptoms… it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. However, it’s difficult to diagnose definitively without a more thorough examination and ruling out other potential causes. I’m going to perform a physical exam now. This will involve checking for tender points in various areas of your body. It won’t be pleasant, but it will help me to determine the likely cause of your discomfort. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Tender points? Sounds… fun. If you think it’s necessary, sure. Let’s get it over with. I really do need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. Okay, I’m going to press here, on the sides of your neck… any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: A little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. It's not terrible, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And here, along your shoulder blades… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely more there. A bit of a sharp ache when you press. Not a pleasant feeling. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately, it can be. And here, around your elbows… any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That’s… yeah, that's tender. Feels like a knot or something. Why are you poking all these places? It’s making me nervous. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: I am assessing for specific tender points, Ms. Kovtun, as I explained earlier. It is part of the diagnostic process. Please try to remain still. And to answer your question, it doesn’t necessarily indicate something “bad,” but it does contribute to the overall clinical picture. Now, here, around your hips… any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Mostly on the right side. Look, I know you’re trying to figure things out, but this is kind of uncomfortable and it's making me anxious. Are we getting anywhere? Can’t we just… run some more tests? Maybe an MRI or something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, I understand your discomfort and anxiety. However, an MRI is not indicated at this time. It would be an unnecessary and costly investigation given your symptoms and current presentation. We are systematically ruling out other possible causes. Based on the tender points I have identified, and your reported fatigue and muscle aches, my preliminary assessment is fibromyalgia. However, fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion. We must rule out other conditions first. I would like to order a few additional blood tests, specifically a sedimentation rate and a C-reactive protein, to rule out any underlying inflammation. I also recommend a sleep study, as disrupted sleep can exacerbate fibromyalgia symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Okay, fine. Do what you have to do. But can we please hurry? I have deadlines. And I still haven’t even gotten breakfast. Sleep study sounds… inconvenient. How long does that take?
DOCTOR: The sleep study involves wearing sensors overnight to monitor your sleep patterns. It can be done at a sleep center, or with a home sleep apnea test, which is less intrusive, though slightly less accurate. It will take several hours to complete. I’ll have the clinic staff schedule it for you. The blood tests can be done here today before you leave. While we await the results, I recommend implementing some lifestyle modifications. Regular exercise, stress management techniques, and maintaining a healthy diet can significantly improve fibromyalgia symptoms. I'll provide you with some resources at the end of this consultation. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Kovtun?
