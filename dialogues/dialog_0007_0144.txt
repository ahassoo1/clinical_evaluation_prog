DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Hernandez, is it? Well, I don't really have anything wrong, not exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she just thought I should… get checked. You know, make sure everything's still ticking. I'm not one for fuss, but here I am. It's August already, isn't it? Time just flies.
DOCTOR: It's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in, Lilly. Preventative care is always a good idea. And you're right, August is flying by. So, just to clarify, you're coming in for a general check-up, mostly at your daughter’s suggestion?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. A general look-see. She worries too much, that girl. Always has. Says I need to make sure my… what does she call it… my “baseline” is okay. Honestly, I feel fine. A little creaky in the mornings, but who isn’t at my age? I’ve been a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, a long time now. You get used to being on your feet.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful you've stayed so active. Being a surgical tech is demanding work! And "baseline" is a good way to think about it – just getting a snapshot of how things are now. Okay, let’s start with a little bit of background information. Have you had any major medical issues in the past – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical issues. Let me think. My husband, God rest his soul, he had… something with his heart. A blockage, I think. I mostly just took care of him. As for me… honestly, I can’t recall anything major. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. I’ve broken a wrist, slipped on the ice a few winters back, but it healed fine. Nothing they needed to… fuss over, you know? I take a little something for my blood pressure, now that I think about it, but it's just a small pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned a small pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Names just… slip my mind these days. It’s a little white one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My daughter handles the refills, so she’d know the proper name, I’m sure. Honestly, I don’t like to bother with all the details. Pills are pills, as long as they do what they’re supposed to, right?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. We can certainly look that up in your records. Now, besides the blood pressure medication, are you taking any other vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a calcium pill, I think. For my bones, you know, being a woman of a certain age. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take one of those… what are they called… the ones for arthritis? They don't really do much, but my friend swears by them. Honestly, I forget half the time if I even took it that day. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Well, I don't particularly like shellfish, but that's not an allergy, is it? I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, not that I recall. My daughter always asks me this, and I always say no. I suppose if I was allergic to something, I'd remember, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, yes. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Heavens to Betsy, no. My husband always said smoking was a terrible habit, and I always agreed. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's about it. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I’m a respectable woman! I’ve never touched a drop of anything like that in my life. I worry enough about keeping things tidy as it is, without adding that to the mix.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Recent changes… let me think. I’ve been a little more tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t? It’s been so hot, draining, you know? And my knees have been… well, they’ve always been a bit creaky, but maybe a little worse than usual. But honestly, I’m not sure if that's just the weather or… getting older. Everything aches a little more these days.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Hot weather can certainly take a toll. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just try not to poke around too much, my knees are rather sensitive. I’ve been meaning to get them looked at properly, but… well, I keep putting it off. It's not that bad, honestly.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slow. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Let's listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart and lungs sound good, but your heart rate is a little quick. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go… Ooh, that’s a little uncomfortable, dear. See? That's what I mean. They’re not what they used to be. I used to be so nimble, dancing and everything. Now… not so much. I hope you don't mind if I don't bend them too far.
DOCTOR: Of course, only bend them as much as is comfortable. I see some mild swelling and tenderness on the inside of both knees. That's consistent with some arthritis, which is common at your age, especially with your activity level. Alright, that’s enough for now. We’ll get some imaging done to get a better look at the knees. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and fast heart rate, I also want to run some blood work. Just a routine check to make sure everything is functioning properly. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of fuss. But… alright, if you think it’s necessary. Blood work and… imaging. My daughter will be pleased I’m finally getting things checked out properly. She’s always nagging me about it. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is. We'll start with the blood work. I’ll give you a requisition form for the lab. They're just down the hall. As for the imaging, we can schedule that for you at the radiology department. They'll call you to arrange a time. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work. Please take this to the lab. And I’ll have my assistant schedule the imaging for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, thank you, dear. That’s very kind of you. No, I don't think so. Just… will this take long? I have a bit of gardening I was hoping to do this afternoon. The tomatoes are starting to ripen, you see, and they need picking. Oh, and… will it be expensive? My Medicare… is that enough?
DOCTOR: The blood work shouldn't take too long – maybe 20-30 minutes. As for the imaging, that will depend on what we order, but it shouldn’t be a lengthy process. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover most of the expenses. There might be a small co-pay, depending on your plan, but we'll have the billing department check everything before scheduling anything, so you'll know the exact amount beforehand. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, in case we need to use it for the imaging?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know. A co-pay is fine, as long as it's not too outrageous. Contrast dye… Hmm. I don't think so. I've never had any dye before, to my knowledge. My daughter always asks me these questions, and I always say no. I suppose if I was allergic, I'd remember, wouldn't I? I’ve never really been sick, you know. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, then, let’s get the ball rolling. I’ll have my assistant schedule the imaging and confirm your Medicare coverage. They’ll also let you know if there’s anything specific you need to do to prepare for the imaging. To recap, we’re going to do some blood work and imaging of your knees. We’ll address your slightly elevated blood pressure. And based on the results, we can discuss a plan for managing your knee pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds perfectly alright. Blood work, imaging, and… a plan. My daughter will be so relieved. She worries too much, that girl, but she means well. Oh, and thank you. You've been very patient with an old woman who forgets everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. It’s my pleasure. And don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to all of us. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here's the contact information for the clinic and my direct extension. I'll have my assistant come in to go over everything with you before you leave. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You too. I appreciate your kindness. Right then. I suppose I better get going. Those tomatoes aren’t going to pick themselves! .
