DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. It's about time someone got around to seeing me. This foot, you see. It’s been awful. A sore, really. A bad one. I’ve had diabetes for…well, a long time now, and it just won't heal. Honestly, I’ve tried everything my daughter told me to. Everything. And she’s a nurse, you know. Not a very good one, if you ask me, but still.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It’s frustrating when something doesn’t heal as it should, especially with a chronic condition like diabetes. And it’s good that your daughter is helping you, even if you disagree on occasion. We’ll certainly take a look at this foot and see what’s going on. To start, could you tell me a little more about this sore?
PATIENT: Well, it started as just a little…nick, I suppose. From my slipper, probably. I don’t always feel things in my feet, you know. That's what happens when the sugar’s off. Then it got red. And then…it just stayed red. And now it’s…well, look at it! It’s ugly. And it hurts, when I put weight on it. Though mostly it just…is there. A constant reminder. It's been weeks, at least. I've lost track, to be honest. Time just...goes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It appears to be located on the… …dorsal aspect of your left foot. And you're right, it does look quite inflamed. It's good you brought it to our attention. When you say “weeks,” roughly how many weeks would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My granddaughter, Lily, came to visit…that was the Fourth of July, and I remember distinctly complaining about it then. So…about a month. Maybe a little longer? A month and a week, perhaps. It's hard to say. I don’t bother with calendars much anymore. Too depressing, always reminding you of…things. Though I do recall it was after Lily brought that awful pineapple upside-down cake. Really, pineapple in cake? A travesty. But yes, a month, give or take. It hasn't gotten bigger, but it certainly hasn’t gotten better.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That's helpful. And I appreciate the colorful commentary regarding the pineapple upside-down cake—you have a good memory for details! Now, beyond the redness and discomfort when you put weight on it, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well, it smells a bit, if I'm honest. Not terrible, but…not pleasant. And sometimes, especially at night, it feels…warm. Sort of feverish, you know? Not a shiver-inducing fever, just…warm to the touch. And my daughter, when she checked it last, said it was…“weeping,” whatever that means. Just looked like…soggy skin. Honestly, I'd rather not think about it too much. It's unpleasant. And frankly, I've seen better. I used to be a medical scientist, you know. A good one. I've seen all sorts of things. This isn't the worst, but it's certainly…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Cannington. It's important information. “Weeping” simply means that it's discharging some fluid. The warmth and odor are concerning, and given your history of diabetes, we need to take this seriously. Now, you mentioned you were a medical scientist. That's fascinating! Perhaps your background will help me explain things clearly. Before we proceed with an exam, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, I was a medical scientist. A research scientist, specializing in…never you mind. It's all rather technical. Let's just say I knew a great deal more about feet than most doctors these days. As for my overall health…it's declining, naturally. I'm eighty-nine years old! What do you expect? The diabetes is…managed, I suppose. I take pills. Several pills. My daughter makes sure of it. My blood pressure is…okay. Sometimes a little high, sometimes a little low. I get tired easily. Very easily. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. That's why I need those big glasses. I used to have a perfectly steady hand for microscopy, you know. Now…not so much. Honestly, I’m a bit of a mess these days. But I’m still here, aren't I? And that's something.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely still here, Ms. Cannington, and that is something. And your background is very helpful - I appreciate you sharing that with me. Could you tell me which medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is always the worst part. Let me see…there’s the metformin, for the sugar, of course. Two pills, twice a day. And a pill called lisinopril, for my blood pressure. One of those every morning. Oh, and something for my cholesterol, atorvastatin, I think. Ten milligrams. And sometimes, if my blood pressure is really high, my daughter makes me take a little white pill…hydrochlorothiazide, I believe. It makes me feel…funny. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. Honestly, it’s a whole regimen. I keep them all in that little pill organizer, but sometimes I get them mixed up. My daughter gets very upset when that happens. She says I need to be more careful. Honestly, it’s just…a lot. I’m not as sharp as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That’s a helpful list, and I understand it can be difficult to keep track of everything. We can certainly review this with your daughter to ensure you are taking the correct medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to penicillin, but that was…ages ago. I haven’t taken penicillin in decades. And no food allergies that I know of. I enjoy a good custard, even though my daughter says it’s too sugary. Honestly, a little custard never hurt anyone. Except maybe my sugar levels, but that's beside the point. No, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. Though I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to a mosquito bite in the Marshall Islands…but that was hardly an allergy. Just a very itchy bite. Honestly, I’m not prone to allergies. I’m a fairly robust person, despite my age. Or I used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Cannington. And it sounds like you've lived a full and adventurous life. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. When I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was…a long time ago. And I had pneumonia once, a very bad case. Had to be hospitalized for that, back in…the sixties, I believe. And a few years back, I was hospitalized for a little bit when my blood sugar got really out of control. They had to adjust my medication. And…oh, yes. When I broke my wrist, tripping over that silly cat. Honestly, that cat is a menace. Otherwise, no. Nothing too serious. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. A few bumps and bruises, a broken wrist, a bit of pneumonia…but nothing life-threatening. I always took good care of myself. Still do, as best I can. Though it's getting harder, naturally.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, aside from the appendectomy and repair of your broken wrist?
PATIENT: Hm. Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall. I had a rather nasty case of cataracts removed from both eyes, but that was outpatient, a quick procedure. My husband had a hip replacement, but that was him, not me! No, I haven’t had any major surgeries. Just the appendix, the wrist, and the cataracts. All fairly routine, really. I always preferred to avoid surgery if at all possible. Too risky, you know. And I’ve always had a bit of a…delicate constitution. Not prone to healing quickly, if you understand. Honestly, I’m rather surprised I’ve made it this long, with all my ailments. But here I am, still kicking, aren't I? Though my foot is certainly making things difficult.
DOCTOR: You are certainly kicking, Ms. Cannington, and we’ll do our best to help you continue to do so! Now, could you tell me about the health of your family?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family. A complicated subject. My husband, bless his soul, he died of heart disease. A very sudden thing. And his mother, she had diabetes, like me. Not well-managed, though. Lost a foot, eventually. Which is why I take such pains with my own. My brother, he’s still alive, but he’s not much for talking about health. A bit of a recluse, really. And my sister…she had some sort of cancer, years ago. Beat it, though. Remarkably resilient woman. As for my children…my daughter, as you know, is a nurse. Always fussing over everyone’s health. And my son…he’s…well, let’s just say he’s not the healthiest specimen. A bit of a drinker, if I’m honest. Not something we talk about much. Honestly, a bit of a mess, that one. But what can you do? Family is family. A mixed bag, really. Mostly prone to heart disease and diabetes, if I had to generalize. Not a particularly robust bunch, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cannington. That gives me a good understanding. Finally, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Humph. Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, briefly, when he was younger, but he gave it up when I told him to. And as for alcohol…a glass of sherry with dinner, occasionally. For medicinal purposes, you understand. Helps with digestion. But nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Don’t be ridiculous! I’m a retired medical scientist! I’ve seen the damage those things can do. No, I lead a very respectable life. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. And I enjoy reading. Mostly historical novels. And I watch the news, though it’s rather depressing these days. Honestly, I’m a bit of a homebody. A quiet life, really. Nothing scandalous. I’ve always been a very responsible person. A bit of a stickler for rules, if I’m honest. And I certainly don’t partake in any…unsavory activities. Honestly, the thought of it! Preposterous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That gives me a very complete picture. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam of your foot, if that's alright with you. This will help me assess the severity of the sore and determine the best course of action. I will explain everything as I go. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Very well. But be gentle, mind you. I don’t have the constitution I used to. And do explain everything, as you promised. I may be old, but I’m still a scientist at heart. I expect a thorough explanation of whatever you’re doing. And please, no poking and prodding unnecessarily. Just a careful examination, that's all. And do wash your hands first. One can never be too careful, you know. Germs are everywhere. Honestly, you doctors are always handling so many patients…It’s a wonder you don’t all come down with something. But very well. Proceed. But be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I understand. I will be as gentle as possible. And I always wash my hands thoroughly between patients to prevent the spread of infection. Now, I’m going to start by taking a look at your foot. I will visually inspect the sore, check for any signs of infection – such as redness, swelling, or pus – and assess the surrounding tissue. Then, I’ll gently palpate the area to check for warmth and tenderness. I'll also check your pulses in your foot to assess blood flow. Finally, I’ll assess the sensation in your foot to see if there is any nerve damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Humph. That sounds…reasonable. Though I suspect you’ll find nothing I don’t already know. I’ve been observing this foot for weeks, you know. It's not a particularly complex case. Still, proceed. But do be careful with those pulses. I have a bit of a sensitive circulatory system. And please, no sudden movements. I don't want to startle myself. And do explain what you're feeling, as you go. If you detect a lack of sensation, for example, please tell me. I like to be informed. Honestly, you doctors sometimes act as if we're children. Just a careful examination, mind you. And a thorough explanation. That's all I ask. Now, get on with it. But gently. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. As you can see, the sore is located on the dorsal aspect of your left foot, as we discussed. It appears to be approximately…one and a half centimeters in diameter. The surrounding skin is erythematous – meaning it’s red – and there appears to be some mild edema – or swelling. I do note some discoloration of the tissue around the sore, which could indicate early signs of infection. Now, I’m going to gently palpate the area to assess tenderness. I’m applying very light pressure now…Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: A little. Just a dull ache, really. Not sharp. More of a…throbbing sensation. It’s always a bit tender, you know. Especially when someone pokes at it. Honestly, you’d be tender too, if you had a sore on your foot for weeks. But yes, a little discomfort. Not unbearable, though. It’s more of an annoyance, really. And it does throb a bit, as I mentioned before. Especially at night. Honestly, it’s rather disruptive to my sleep. But yes, a little tenderness. Just a dull ache. Nothing dramatic. Don’t poke too hard, mind you. I don’t want to aggravate it. And please, explain what you’re feeling. Are you detecting any warmth? I suspect you will. It always feels a bit warm to the touch. Especially at night. Honestly, it’s rather unpleasant. But yes, a little tenderness. Don’t poke too hard. And explain what you’re feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington, you are correct. I am detecting some warmth to the touch compared to your other foot. The surrounding tissue is also slightly firm to the touch. Now, I’m going to gently check your pulses in your foot to assess blood flow. I’m going to palpate the dorsalis pedis pulse here…and the posterior tibial pulse here…Do you feel any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just a little pressure, really. Nothing unbearable. I have a bit of a sensitive circulatory system, as I mentioned before, but not painful. I do sometimes have trouble feeling my pulses, though. It’s one of the complications of the diabetes, you know. The nerves…they’re not what they used to be. But no, not painful. Just a little pressure. And please, explain what you’re feeling. Are you detecting a strong pulse? I suspect not. It’s often weak, you know. Especially in this foot. Honestly, it’s a bit worrisome. But no, not painful. Just a little pressure. Explain what you’re feeling. Are you detecting a strong pulse? I suspect not. Honestly, it’s a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. As you suspected, the pulses in your left foot are somewhat diminished compared to your right foot. I'm using this Doppler ultrasound now to better assess the blood flow. It uses sound waves to detect the pulsations in your arteries. As you can hear…...the signal is weaker in your left foot, which confirms that the blood flow is reduced. Now, I’m going to assess the sensation in your foot to check for any nerve damage. I’m going to gently touch your foot with this cotton swab…Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Humph. Barely. It’s…faint. A little tingling, perhaps. Not a clear sensation, though. It’s always been difficult for me to feel things in my feet, you know. One of the complications of the diabetes. The nerves…they're not what they used to be. Honestly, it’s a bit worrisome. Are you detecting any nerve damage? I suspect you will. It’s always been difficult for me to feel things in my feet, you know. Can you feel this? Barely. A little tingling, perhaps. Not a clear sensation, though. Honestly, it’s a bit worrisome. Are you detecting any nerve damage? I suspect you will. Just confirm my suspicions, really. It’s always been difficult for me to feel things in my feet, you know. Can you feel this? Barely. Just confirm my suspicions, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. You are correct. The sensation in your left foot is diminished compared to your right foot. I'm unable to detect a clear sensation in several areas, which suggests some degree of peripheral neuropathy – or nerve damage. Now, I’m going to check the skin on your foot for any signs of skin breakdown or infection. I’m going to gently examine the area around the sore…Do you feel any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just a little pressure, really. The skin is…dry, I suppose. And a bit flaky. Honestly, it’s not a particularly healthy piece of skin. I try to moisturize it, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. I do notice some redness around the sore, as we discussed before. And a little bit of swelling. Honestly, it’s not a pretty sight. Do you detect any skin breakdown or infection? I suspect you will. It’s always been a bit problematic, this foot. Honestly, it’s not a pretty sight. Do you detect any skin breakdown or infection? I suspect you will.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I do note some redness and mild swelling around the sore, as you’ve pointed out. The skin is dry and flaky. I do not see any signs of pus or open wounds at this time, but there is a potential for infection given the redness and swelling. Now, based on my examination, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer with potential for infection and signs of peripheral neuropathy. We need to take this seriously to prevent further complications. I recommend obtaining some laboratory tests to confirm the presence of an infection and to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Laboratory tests. Very well. I suppose it’s necessary. Though I’m not particularly fond of needles. But if it’s necessary to prevent further complications, I suppose I can endure it. Which tests are you recommending? And will they be painful? I’d like to know what I’m getting myself into. Honestly, I’ve always preferred a straightforward diagnosis. No unnecessary procedures. Just a clear explanation of what’s going on. And a plan of action. Which tests are you recommending? And will they be painful? I’d like to know what I’m getting myself into. Honestly, I’ve always preferred a straightforward diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I understand your concerns. I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. I'm recommending two main tests: a blood test and a wound culture. The blood test will help assess your overall health, including your blood sugar levels and white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection. The wound culture will involve taking a small sample of fluid from the sore to identify any bacteria that may be present. The blood test will involve a small prick of your finger or the inside of your elbow. It may cause a brief moment of discomfort, but it’s generally well-tolerated. The wound culture may cause a slight stinging sensation, but it’s also generally well-tolerated. Both tests are relatively quick and painless. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmmph. A prick of the finger or the elbow. And a slight stinging sensation. Very well. I suppose I can endure it. Though I do not enjoy needles. And please, be gentle. I’d like you to use a clean needle. I do not want to contract any infections. And please, explain the results to me in a clear and concise manner. No medical jargon, please. I’d like to understand what’s going on. And please, explain the treatment options to me. I’d like to know what I’m getting myself into. And please, be gentle. I’d like you to use a clean needle. I do not want to contract any infections. Very well. Proceed. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. I will use a brand-new, sterile needle for both tests, and I will explain the results to you in a clear and concise manner, avoiding any medical jargon. I’ll order the blood test and wound culture now. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping the sore clean and dry, avoiding putting pressure on your foot, and wearing comfortable shoes. I'll also prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Humph. Clean and dry. Comfortable shoes. Topical antibiotic ointment. Very well. I suppose that’s reasonable. I do have some comfortable shoes. And I’ll make sure to keep the sore clean and dry. Although it’s rather difficult, you know. With my age, and everything. But I’ll do my best. And please, explain the instructions for applying the ointment. I’d like to know how often to apply it, and how much to use. I don’t want to overdo it, or underdo it. Just a clear explanation of what to do. And please, explain what to look for. What are the signs of infection? I’d like to know what to look for. Just a clear explanation of what to do. And please, explain what to look for. What are the signs of infection? Alright. Proceed, then. But be gentle. And explain everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. The ointment is a triple antibiotic ointment, and you'll want to apply a thin layer to the sore twice a day – once in the morning and once before bed. After washing your hands thoroughly, gently clean the sore with mild soap and water, pat it dry with a clean towel, and then apply a thin layer of the ointment. Cover the sore with a sterile bandage. Now, regarding the signs of infection, you'll want to watch for the following: increased redness or swelling around the sore, increased pain, pus or drainage from the sore, a foul odor, fever, or chills. If you notice any of these signs, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Humph. Twice a day. Thin layer. Sterile bandage. Increased redness, swelling, pain, pus, foul odor, fever, chills. Very well. I suppose I can remember that. Although my memory isn't what it used to be. But I’ll do my best. And please, explain how often to change the bandage. And what type of bandage to use. I don’t want to use the wrong type of bandage. And please, explain what to do if the sore gets worse. I’d like to know what to do if the sore gets worse. Just a clear explanation of what to do. And please, explain what to do if the sore gets worse. Just a clear explanation of what to do. Alright. Proceed, then. But be gentle. And explain everything. I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. You should change the bandage daily, or more frequently if it gets wet or dirty. Use a sterile non-adhesive bandage – the type you might use for a minor cut or scrape. Make sure the bandage completely covers the sore. Now, if the sore gets worse, meaning it gets larger, deeper, more painful, or shows any signs of infection that we discussed, please contact me immediately. Do not attempt to treat it yourself. We may need to prescribe a stronger antibiotic or consider other treatment options. I have a nurse who will call you tomorrow to check in and answer any questions you may have. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to assess the healing process. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Daily. Sterile non-adhesive bandage. Contact you immediately if it gets worse. A nurse will call tomorrow. A follow-up appointment in one week. Very well. That seems…thorough, I suppose. Although I do prefer a straightforward approach. But very well. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at this time. You’ve explained everything…rather thoroughly. Although I do suspect it will be a bit of a hassle. But very well. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. I suppose that will be all for now. I'll see you in a week. And please, remind your nurse to speak clearly. I don’t always hear well. Alright. Goodbye, Doctor Bakan. And thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cannington. I’m glad I could help. I’ll be sure to inform my nurse to speak clearly and to take her time. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and remember to keep the sore clean and dry. Goodbye, Ms. Cannington.
