DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part, mostly. It’s been hurting quite a bit lately. Not constantly, you understand, but… episodes, yes. Severe ones. And I do have… something with my immune system, doesn't it? I just can't quite recall the name. It’s been a while since I was properly checked for it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Episodes, you say. And severe. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. It's… difficult to put into words. It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… cramping, deep down. Like a squeezing, but very intense when it comes. And it radiates… does that make sense? It feels like it spreads to my back sometimes, and even down my legs a little. It makes me quite breathless, honestly, when it's at its worst. I just… curl up, mostly. It’s not a pleasant experience at all. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's alright. Cramping, deep, radiating to your back and legs… and making you breathless. That is helpful. And when did these episodes start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that is a tricky one. It feels like they’ve been… coming and going for a while. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer? It’s hard to say. They weren’t very frequent at first. Just a little discomfort now and then. But in the last month or so… they’ve become much more noticeable. And more… intense. I do recall one particularly bad episode about two weeks ago. That’s what finally prompted me to schedule an appointment. I'm sorry I can't be more precise. Time just… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that’s understandable. So, roughly six months, worsening in the last month, with a particularly bad episode two weeks ago. Have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a very astute question, Doctor. Let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been able to find any pattern, at least. I’ve tried to pay attention, but it seems to come on randomly. I haven’t changed my diet, and I’ve been keeping to my usual routine. Stress, perhaps? I suppose I’ve been a bit more preoccupied lately with… well, never mind. It's probably not relevant. I just try to remain calm, but these episodes do tend to… upset me, naturally. I truly haven't identified anything specific that sets them off, which is quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No identified triggers. And you mentioned something about your immune system. Do you recall anything about that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was… a long time ago now. A rheumatologist was involved, I believe. It was… something about my body attacking itself? And there were… tests. Lots of blood work. I believe the name… it began with an 'S'. Something like… Systemic Lupus… Erythematosus? Yes, that sounds right. SLE. That was it. It's been… well managed for years, or so I thought. I’ve been taking medication, as prescribed, and attending my regular check-ups. Until recently, everything seemed quite stable. I apologize for the delay in recalling. It's just… difficult to piece everything together.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you were diagnosed with SLE approximately fifteen years ago, and have been under the care of Dr. Albright. Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good. It’s helpful to know it’s documented. Let me think… Well, I've been feeling rather fatigued lately. More so than usual, even for me. And my joints… they ache a bit. It's not constant, but I do notice it, especially in my hands and wrists. And… sometimes I get a rash. A butterfly-shaped rash on my face, I believe? Though it hasn’t been very prominent recently. Just a little redness, really. Nothing too alarming. Oh, and I’ve been running a low-grade fever occasionally. Nothing that requires medication, mind you. Just a slightly elevated temperature. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember everything… it’s a bit of a jumble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, joint ache, occasional rash, low-grade fever… Yes, that’s all relevant. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Aside from the SLE, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Perhaps twenty years ago? And I've had the usual things, I suppose. Pneumonia once, a broken wrist as a child. Nothing significant, really. And… I do have high blood pressure, which is being managed with medication. And… oh! I had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back. It was… quite unpleasant, I recall. But that was treated with antibiotics and hasn’t recurred. I do try to keep on top of things, you see. Regular check-ups and all that. I apologize if I'm rambling. I'm just trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling. It's good to have a complete picture. And you're doing well to keep on top of everything. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have my medication for the high blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it is called. And then there’s Hydroxychloroquine for the SLE. And… occasionally, I take Ibuprofen for joint pain, when it gets particularly bad. Just over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing prescribed regularly. And… oh! I also take a Vitamin D supplement. My levels were a bit low during my last check-up. I do try to be diligent about taking everything as prescribed. It's all a bit much to keep track of sometimes, I must admit. I do have a list at home, if that would be helpful? I just don't have it with me at the moment.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. We can verify everything later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good question. Let me think… I'm allergic to penicillin. I discovered that many years ago. It gives me a rather nasty rash, and I have some difficulty breathing. I've been very careful to avoid it ever since. And… I believe I'm mildly allergic to certain pollens. It just causes a bit of sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. And… no, I don't believe I have any other allergies. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard, actually. Just the penicillin and the pollens. I do carry an EpiPen, just in case, but I’ve never had to use it. It's just a precaution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Penicillin allergy, mild pollen allergy. And you carry an EpiPen. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’ve always been a very… temperate person. I believe in living a healthy lifestyle. And that includes avoiding anything that could be detrimental to my health. I do enjoy gardening, you see. And I spend quite a bit of time reading. Those are my vices, if you can call them that. I do try to maintain a peaceful and healthy existence.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Well, I live alone. Have done for many years. My husband passed away some time ago. And… I don’t have any close family nearby. My children live in different states. We keep in touch, of course, but it’s not the same as having them close by. And… I suppose I’ve been feeling a bit… isolated lately. It’s probably nothing to do with my health, but it’s been on my mind. I do have a lovely neighbour who checks on me from time to time. She’s a godsend, really. But… that’s all. I apologize for being so… rambling again. I just wanted to give you a complete picture. Is that helpful? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Glymph, it’s not rambling at all. It’s important for me to understand the whole picture, and your social situation is a part of that. Alright. Let's proceed with a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful during the exam. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I do hope it's not too much trouble. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to clarify anything. I sometimes struggle to articulate myself clearly. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain, you see. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It means a great deal.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, though there is a slight murmur. It's been documented before, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I believe so. Dr. Albright mentioned something about a murmur during one of my check-ups. It hasn’t ever caused me any trouble, though. I’m not sure if it’s related to this pain, but it’s good to know you’re aware of it. And… is everything alright so far? I do get a bit anxious during medical exams, I must admit. It’s just the anticipation, you see. Are you finding anything concerning?
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s… tender. Right there. On the left side. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s… uncomfortable. It feels like a dull ache, but it’s definitely more pronounced when you press on it. And… it radiates a little bit to my back, as I mentioned earlier. Is that what you were expecting? Am I making a fuss over nothing? I do have a rather low pain tolerance, I must admit.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making a fuss. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Any rebound tenderness?
PATIENT: Rebound… tenderness? Oh dear. What does that mean, exactly? Does that mean… if you let go quickly? I’m not sure I understand. Should I… brace myself? I apologize for my ignorance, Doctor. I just want to be sure I understand what’s happening. It’s a bit overwhelming, you see.
DOCTOR: Rebound tenderness means I press down, and then quickly release. It helps determine if there's inflammation of the peritoneum. Don’t worry, it's just a quick check. Any pain with that quick release?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. That… that was quite painful, actually. Not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. A sharp, stabbing pain, just for a moment. It’s… different than the dull ache I was feeling before. It’s… it’s higher up, I think. More towards the centre of my abdomen. And… it’s a little bit concerning. Is that… bad? What does that mean, Doctor? Am I… in trouble? I apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… I haven’t experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Given your history of SLE and diverticulitis, and the rebound tenderness, it is concerning. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. And I want a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast, to rule out a diverticulitis flare or other intra-abdominal pathology. We need to get a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever. Please take it as directed.
PATIENT: Oh. A CT scan… and more blood work. That sounds… serious. Diverticulitis flare… Is that… dangerous? And what about the SLE? Could this be related to that? I understand you need to get a clearer picture, Doctor, and I appreciate you taking this seriously. But… could you explain it to me in a little more detail? Just… so I know what to expect. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Avoiding certain foods, perhaps? I just want to be prepared. I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just… I’m a bit frightened, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. Let's break this down. Diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. A flare-up can cause abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and changes in bowel habits. It can be serious if it leads to a perforation or abscess, which is why we need the CT scan to rule that out. As for your SLE, it's possible it's contributing to this, as SLE can cause inflammation throughout the body. However, the rebound tenderness makes me concerned about an acute process like a diverticulitis flare. For now, I want you to maintain a liquid diet until we get the results of the CT scan. Avoid solid foods. Also, if you develop a fever over 101°F, severe nausea, vomiting, or inability to pass gas, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'm going to write you a prescription for pain relief, and I’ll have the lab draw the blood work now. We should have the CT scan scheduled within 24 hours. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A liquid diet… and watch for a fever. No solid foods. And go to the emergency room if… if things get worse. I think… I think I understand. But… what kind of pain reliever are you prescribing? And… will it interact with my other medications? I do worry about side effects, you see. And… could you please explain what a perforation is? Just… so I know what to look out for. I apologize for being such a bother, Doctor. I just… I want to be as prepared as possible. I do appreciate your patience. I really do.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Ms. Glymph. It's important for you to understand everything. I’m prescribing you a mild opioid, Tramadol. It’s less potent than some of the other pain relievers, and it has a lower risk of side effects. However, it can cause drowsiness and constipation, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. It can interact with your other medications, so it's important to avoid combining it with other sedatives or antidepressants. A perforation is a hole in the wall of the colon. It's a serious complication of diverticulitis, as it can lead to infection of the abdominal cavity. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. It requires immediate surgery. That's why it's important to monitor your symptoms closely. I'm going to give you a handout with detailed instructions about the medication and what to look out for. And I want you to call my office immediately if you experience any worsening symptoms, even if it's just a slight increase in pain. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Tramadol… and watch for drowsiness. And avoid combining it with other medications. A perforation… that sounds… frightening. Immediate surgery. And call the office if anything gets worse. I… I think that covers everything for now. Perhaps. I just… I’m very grateful for your patience, Doctor. And for explaining everything so clearly. I do appreciate it. I think… I think I need to sit down for a moment. Thank you again, Doctor. I really do. I suppose… I should go get the blood work done now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead and get the blood work done. The lab technician will guide you. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office with any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Glymph. Try to rest and stay hydrated. And take it easy. I'll be in touch as soon as the results come back.
