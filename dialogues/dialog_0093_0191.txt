DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s… something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That's a very responsible decision, and I commend you for taking this step. It’s always best to be proactive about one’s health. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to gather some information to better understand your risk factors and ensure we provide you with the most appropriate care. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’ll do my best to answer truthfully. It’s just… a bit sensitive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I understand completely. Everything you share with me will be kept strictly confidential, as per medical ethics. There's no judgment here; my role is simply to help you. Let’s start with a bit of background. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This is… this is my first time. It’s something I always meant to do, but… life got in the way, I suppose. A lot of things happening, you know? Family, work… things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. Life often has a way of getting in the way. It’s commendable that you’re making time for this now. To help me assess your risk, could you tell me a little about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh… well. This is sensitive, isn’t it? I’ve been married for… forty years now, Doctor. To the same man. We’ve always been faithful to each other, as far as I know. But… my husband passed away last year. And… well, I’ve been… seeing someone new for a few months now. It's... a companionship, really. But I want to be careful. Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Shaub. It takes courage to discuss these matters, and I appreciate your openness. Knowing that you've had a long-term monogamous relationship followed by a new partner is helpful information. To clarify, when you say "seeing someone new," is this a casual relationship, or are you sexually active with this person?
PATIENT: Yes, we are… sexually active, Doctor. It hasn’t been… frequent, but it has happened. And I just… I want to be sure. To protect myself, and… and him, of course. It’s a bit foolish, perhaps, after forty years with one person, to worry now, but… better safe than sorry, I always say.
DOCTOR: That’s a very wise approach, Ms. Shaub. It's never foolish to prioritize your health and well-being, regardless of past experiences. And protecting both yourself and your partner is commendable. Now, have either you or your current partner ever shared needles, or used intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Definitely not. Neither of us have ever touched a needle, Doctor. We are… quite respectable people. And we certainly don't partake in anything like that. Just wanted to make that clear. It's… a bit upsetting to even be asked, frankly. But I understand you have to ask these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. Please accept my apologies if that question was insensitive or caused any offense. It’s simply a standard part of the risk assessment protocol, and I assure you, I meant no disrespect. It’s important to rule out all potential avenues of transmission. Now, have you ever received any blood transfusions or blood products?
PATIENT: Oh… blood transfusions… Let me see… I had a surgery, oh, must have been… twenty years ago now. A hysterectomy. And I think I received a transfusion then. But it was so long ago, I can’t be certain. They didn’t really explain much back then, you know? It was just… part of the procedure. I don’t remember anything specific about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shaub. Knowing about the past surgery and potential transfusion is helpful. It’s good to recall as much detail as possible, even if it’s just a vague memory. Finally, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections ?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've always been very careful. And my husband… he was a good man. We… we always looked after each other. We didn’t… indulge in risky behavior, you could say. I'm a bit embarrassed to even be discussing this, frankly. It feels strange to be talking about such things at my age. But I want to be thorough, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your feelings, Ms. Shaub. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit awkward discussing these matters, especially given your long-term relationship. You have no reason to be embarrassed; you’re taking a proactive step towards protecting your health, and I commend you for that. Now that I have a better understanding of your risk factors, let’s discuss the HIV testing process. We can perform a simple blood test in our lab today. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine, Doctor. A blood test is… acceptable. A few days is alright. I just… I hope it’s negative. It's a silly thing to say, I suppose. But… it would be a relief. What happens if it is positive? I mean… what would I do?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Shaub. It’s natural to feel anxious about the possibility of a positive result. And it’s good that you’re asking these questions. If the test is positive, it means the virus is present in your system. However, a positive test result doesn't automatically mean you are unwell. With proper medical care, including antiretroviral therapy , people living with HIV can live long and healthy lives. ART works by suppressing the virus, preventing it from damaging the immune system, and significantly reducing the risk of transmission to others. We would immediately connect you with an HIV specialist who can discuss treatment options, provide ongoing care, and answer all of your questions. We also have resources available to help you cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of a diagnosis. It’s important to remember that you are not alone, and we will support you every step of the way. For now, let’s focus on getting the test done. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me. I… I’m a bit nervous, I confess. It’s not the needle itself, it’s… the waiting. And what it might mean. Just tell me what to expect, step by step.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Let me walk you through the process step by step. First, a phlebotomist—a trained professional who draws blood—will clean the inside of your elbow with an antiseptic wipe. They will then tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. Using a sterile needle, they will draw a small amount of blood—about a few teaspoons—into a collection tube. You might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The whole procedure typically takes just a few minutes. After the blood is drawn, they will apply a bandage to the site to stop any bleeding. You'll need to keep the bandage on for at least fifteen minutes. The blood sample will then be sent to a laboratory for analysis. It usually takes 3-5 business days to get the results back. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. Do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: No… no, that sounds… manageable. Three to five days. What if… what if my partner needs to be tested too? Should he… Is that necessary? I mean, if I test positive… he’ll need to know, won’t he?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Shaub. If your test results are positive, it is essential that your partner is tested as well. This is for their health and well-being, and also to understand the potential source of the infection. Even if you’ve been in a monogamous relationship for a long time, there’s a possibility of transmission if either of you has been exposed to the virus at any point. It's also important to rule out any other potential sources of infection. We can provide your partner with the necessary information and resources to get tested. We can also discuss safe sex practices and preventative measures to minimize the risk of transmission. Would you like me to provide you with information about testing options for your partner?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be… very helpful. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? While I’m waiting for the results? Anything at all? It's just… it's hard to just wait, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Shaub. Waiting can be incredibly difficult. For now, while you're awaiting your results, there aren't any specific medical precautions you need to take. However, it's important to avoid any unprotected sexual activity. Focus on managing your stress levels. Engage in activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable – spending time with loved ones, reading, exercising, or practicing mindfulness. It’s also important to remember that HIV is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, shaking hands, or sharing utensils. There's no need to isolate yourself or change your daily routines. I’m going to have the phlebotomist come in and draw your blood now. I'll also provide you with information about local HIV testing resources for your partner, as well as some materials about HIV prevention and treatment. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very… kind. And patient. Let's… let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I'll have the phlebotomist come in right away. Remember, you’ve taken a very important step towards protecting your health, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. “Could we please have the phlebotomist come to room three?
