DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my belly. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s quite something. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I’m having a bit of trouble explaining exactly when it started… or how often it’s been happening. I know I’ve been seen for… something with my immune system, hasn’t it? Lupus, I believe? It feels connected to that, somehow.
DOCTOR: Lupus, yes. We’ve been managing that for some time now. “Down low in the belly,” you say. Can you be a bit more specific about the location of the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… It’s… hard to pinpoint. It feels like… all of here, really. But mostly on the right side, I think? Though sometimes it’s more in the middle. And it’s not just on the surface, it feels deep inside, too. It's a rather… diffuse pain, if that makes any sense. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. I truly do. Is it alright if I say it feels rather… crampy? Though it’s not always crampy. Sometimes it’s more of a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Diffuse pain, right side predominantly, sometimes central, with both crampy and dull aching qualities. That’s… helpful, though I appreciate your acknowledgement of the difficulty in describing it. And it's alright; we’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, when did you first notice this pain beginning?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part, isn’t it? It feels… like it’s been coming and going for… a few months, perhaps? But the severe episodes… those feel more recent. Perhaps the last month or so? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I apologize. I do remember feeling unwell around that time, generally tired and achy, but I assumed that was just… part of the lupus acting up. It’s so hard to know what’s what, sometimes. Is it possible it could be connected to that?
DOCTOR: It is possible. Lupus can present with a variety of abdominal symptoms, though typically… not this vague. We need to rule out other possibilities. Has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggered…? That’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything particular. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet – mostly. I haven’t changed anything recently that I’m aware of. I suppose… sometimes after I’ve been on my feet for a long time it feels worse? But I'm a ship engineer, Doctor, so being on my feet is rather unavoidable. And I wouldn’t say it’s every time. Honestly, I’m a bit puzzled myself. Is there something I should be looking out for? Perhaps a certain food or activity? I just… want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Being on your feet for extended periods could certainly contribute. And it's good you’re mindful of potential triggers. Alright. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you experience any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation along with this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… The nausea… yes, sometimes. Not terribly severe, but a bit queasy. And… yes, constipation, more often than not. Though I've had a few episodes of… well, the opposite, if you understand me. It’s not consistent, you see. It depends. But the constipation is more frequent, I believe. No vomiting, thankfully. I haven’t experienced any of that. Is that… a worry, Doctor? The constipation, I mean? I do try to drink plenty of water, but… it doesn’t always seem to help.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it is relevant. Constipation can be a common symptom of many things, and can certainly be exacerbated by the lupus or any medications you're taking. Speaking of which, can you remind me of all the medications you’re currently on, including any over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit of a list, I’m afraid. Let me see… there’s Hydroxychloroquine, of course, for the lupus. And… Plaquenil, is that the same thing? I get them both, I think. Then there’s… Meloxicam, for the joint pain when it flares up. And… oh dear, I take something for my blood pressure, Losartan, I believe it is. And… Vitamin D, my doctor said my levels were low. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, if they get bad. That’s over-the-counter, of course. And… oh, and a fiber supplement, because of the… well, you know. Is that everything? I do apologize if I’m forgetting something. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Hydroxychloroquine, Plaquenil—yes, they are often prescribed together. Meloxicam, Losartan, Vitamin D, Tylenol as needed, and a fiber supplement. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I do have… sensitivities, perhaps? I find strong perfumes give me a headache, and certain fabrics irritate my skin, but those aren't allergies, are they? Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything dramatic, thankfully. I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I just… want to get to the bottom of this pain. It's rather unsettling, not knowing what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Given your history of lupus and the constellation of symptoms you’ve described—the diffuse abdominal pain, constipation alternating with diarrhea, occasional nausea—we need to investigate further. I’m going to perform a physical exam now, and then I'd like to order some blood work and a stool sample analysis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam and some tests… yes, that would be good. I’d feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. Please, do whatever you need to do. And thank you for listening, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to be taken seriously. I apologize for being so… long-winded and vague. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with auscultation and palpation of your abdomen. I'll be verbalizing my findings as I go, for documentation purposes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please, do take your time. I’ll try to remain still… though my joints aren’t always cooperative, you understand. I’ll do my best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat hypoactive. Not entirely absent, but diminished. There's some mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. There’s no noticeable organomegaly. Tympanic to percussion throughout, consistent with normal bowel gas. Alright. Now, is there any particular spot that’s more painful when I press?
PATIENT: Yes… right there. It’s not excruciating, but… it’s definitely more sensitive. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. And it seems to radiate a little, doesn’t it? Upwards, towards my… side, I suppose. It’s not constant, you understand. It comes and goes. But that spot… yes, that’s where it’s most noticeable. I do apologize for being so imprecise, Doctor. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with radiation upwards. Dull ache. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 breaths per minute. Your vitals are within normal limits, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. The blood pressure… yes, my doctor has mentioned that before. I try to keep an eye on it, but… it fluctuates, doesn't it? And the pain… it’s still there, of course. Not as bad as some days, but… present. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I do apologize for asking directly, but… I’m a bit anxious, naturally.
DOCTOR: Given your history and the physical exam findings, it's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. It could be a flare-up of your lupus affecting your gastrointestinal system. However, the tenderness in your right lower quadrant raises the possibility of other issues, such as diverticulitis, or even, though less likely given your age, appendicitis. We need to rule those out. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein, a stool culture, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on internally.
PATIENT: A CT scan… oh. Is that… is that a lot of radiation? And diverticulitis… appendicitis… those sound rather unpleasant. I see. Well, if that’s what’s necessary, then please, do proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s… reassuring to know what we’re looking for. When will I know the results, Doctor? And… what happens if it is something more serious? I do apologize for all the questions, but… my mind is racing a bit.
DOCTOR: The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. We’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. If it is diverticulitis, it's usually treated with antibiotics and a liquid diet. Appendicitis, however, requires immediate surgical intervention. We will discuss all options if that is the case. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours, and I'll call you with the results as soon as they are available. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever in the meantime—Acetaminophen 500mg, take two tablets every six hours as needed. Here is your prescription. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids and eat a bland diet. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… yes, that’s what I sometimes take for headaches. Very well. And… a bland diet. I suppose soup would be a good idea, wouldn’t it? I… I think that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. I’m just… rather anxious, naturally. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll… I’ll wait for your call. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all. Just follow the instructions on the prescription, and avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. If you experience any worsening of your pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. You may get dressed and leave at your convenience.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll… I’ll wait for your call. .
