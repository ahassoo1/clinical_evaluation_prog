DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me in... My wife, she want... a baby. Yes, a baby. We… we want to make a baby. But we old, you know? Maybe need help. I don’t remember everything so well now. But that is why we are here, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you're wondering if there might be any medical considerations given your age. That's a very reasonable thing to discuss. Just to clarify, Mr. Carlotta, you said you are 70 years old. And what about your wife’s age?
PATIENT: Yes, seventy. I think. Maybe sixty-nine. Time… goes fast. My wife… she is younger. Much younger. Let me think… she is… fifty-two, I believe. Yes, fifty-two. She is very healthy, my wife. Very strong. But… maybe too old also, for baby? I don’t know. We have been married for… a long time. But never… a baby. Now we want.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you’re 70, and your wife is 52. That’s helpful to know. It’s wonderful that you're both considering this together. It is possible to conceive at those ages, though there are certainly things we need to consider to ensure a healthy pregnancy, should that occur. First, let's talk a bit about your medical histories. Have either of you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… I had a bad back, once. From lifting metal. Building things. But it is better now. Old injury. My wife… she is very healthy. I don’t think she has… problems. But she goes to the doctor. Every year. For check-ups. I… I forget what they check for. She tells me, but I don’t… remember. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all that you don't remember specific details, Mr. Carlotta. That’s perfectly normal. The important thing is that your wife sees a doctor regularly, which is excellent. Do you happen to know if she has any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Thyroid… what is thyroid? No, I don't think so. She… she takes a pill. Every morning. For her… bones, maybe? Or her heart? Something like that. She says it keeps her strong. And she eats very healthy. Lots of vegetables. She is very careful. I think the doctor told her something about… cholesterol? Is that a problem? I'm very confused now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like your wife is proactive about her health, which is great. The pill she takes could be for a number of things – for bone health, heart health, or cholesterol, as you mentioned. High cholesterol can be a concern, but it’s manageable. To get a clearer picture, and to make sure everything is safe, would you mind if I take a look at her medical records?
PATIENT: Records… yes, okay. If that will help. She gave me some papers… I think. I put them in a folder. At home. With all the important things. Bills, letters… Maybe the records are there. But she is the one who keeps track of things. I am not so good with… papers. Can we… call her? Maybe she can bring them? Or tell you? I worry I will just get confused.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. That's a very good idea. It would be much easier to have your wife share her medical history directly, or bring in the records. That way, we can be as accurate as possible. Do you have her phone number handy?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I do. Let me see… Here. It is… five five five… then some numbers. I’m not very good with remembering them. She does all the calling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm calling her now. While we wait, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I build things. Metal things, plastic things. Small models. For people. It keeps me busy. I don’t… exercise much. My back, you know. But I walk. To the store. Sometimes. And I eat… mostly what my wife cooks. She makes good food. Healthy food. I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I stopped. Many years ago. Before we were married, even. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information, Mr. Carlotta. It's good to know you used to smoke, and that you've stopped – that's excellent. And the fact that you walk and eat a healthy diet is also positive. It gives me a better picture of your overall health. Hello?
PATIENT: “Hello? Yes?”
DOCTOR: Hello, my name is Dr. Andraca. I’m speaking with your husband, Manuel Carlotta. He’s here at the clinic today discussing the possibility of starting a family. He’s kindly given me permission to speak with you to gather some information about your medical history, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: “Oh, yes, of course! That's perfectly fine. He forgets everything, poor man. Just give me a moment to find a pen. What would you like to know?”
DOCTOR: Thank you so much. Perhaps we can start with any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: “Well, let me see... I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about five years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And I have slightly high cholesterol, which I'm also managing with a statin. No diabetes or thyroid problems, thankfully. I see my primary care physician regularly, and I’ve had all my routine screenings. Do you want me to list everything?”
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Listing everything would be very helpful. And if you happen to know the names of the medications you’re taking, that would be great too. It will help me get a complete picture of your health. Don't worry about being too detailed, just whatever comes to mind.
PATIENT: "Okay, let's see... For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. And for the cholesterol, it’s Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams. I also take Vitamin D, because my levels were low. Oh, and a calcium supplement, because I'm at risk for osteoporosis. I had a mammogram and pap smear last year, both were normal. Is that enough for now?”
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s incredibly helpful, thank you so much. Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Vitamin D, and calcium supplement. That gives me a very clear understanding of your current medications. And it’s good to hear that your recent mammogram and pap smear were normal. Given your age and these medications, and assuming your husband is also generally healthy, conceiving naturally might be challenging. Have you and your husband discussed any assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization?
PATIENT: "Oh, no, not at all. We hadn't even thought about that! We were hoping it would just... happen. Manuel is a little older, yes, but he's very strong for his age. And I still feel young! We haven't really talked about any of that fancy stuff. Is that something we should be considering?"
DOCTOR: It's certainly something to consider, yes. As you both get older, the chances of conceiving naturally decrease, and the risk of complications during pregnancy increases. Assisted reproductive technologies can significantly improve your chances of success, and there are many options available. However, before we jump to any conclusions, it would be helpful to get a more comprehensive assessment of both your health. I’d like to order some blood tests for both of you to check your hormone levels, assess your overall health, and rule out any potential underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: "Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. Manuel doesn’t like needles, but he’ll manage. He’s a brave man. Anything to help make this happen, really. We’ve waited a long time for this."
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. We'll do everything we can to help. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests now. You can have them drawn at the lab here at the clinic, or at any lab that’s convenient for you. And, Mr. Carlotta, we'll also want to discuss some lifestyle factors that can impact fertility. We'll talk about diet, exercise, and avoiding any harmful substances. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: "Actually, Doctor, one more thing. What about the risk of complications? I've heard it can be dangerous to get pregnant at my age.”
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and it's good you asked. There are increased risks associated with pregnancy at your age, yes. These include gestational diabetes, preeclampsia , and a higher risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. However, with careful monitoring and proactive management, we can significantly reduce those risks. We would closely monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels throughout the pregnancy, and you would have regular ultrasounds to assess the baby’s development. We can also discuss the possibility of genetic testing to screen for any potential chromosomal abnormalities. It’s important to be aware of these risks, but it’s also important to remember that many women in their 50s have successful, healthy pregnancies. We’ll be with you every step of the way to ensure the best possible outcome. Do you have any other questions about that?
PATIENT: "No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you.”
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. I’ll get the blood test orders printed for both of you now. The lab will need a copy of your insurance cards. Mr. Carlotta, it was nice meeting you. We will proceed with the blood work, and we will schedule a follow up to review results. I look forward to helping you both achieve your goal. Do you have any final questions before we conclude today’s visit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. My wife, she knows what to do. She is very smart. Thank you for talking to me. And thank you for helping us. I feel… a little bit hopeful now.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Carlotta. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I’m happy to help in any way I can. And you’re very lucky to have such a supportive wife. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Carlotta.
PATIENT: .
