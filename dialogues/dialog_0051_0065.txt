DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Glazewski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, I’ve gained weight, and I simply can’t seem to understand why. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. It’s not like I’ve changed my habits.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight gain… and you haven’t noticed any significant changes in your diet or activity level?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I eat much the same as I always have—simple, home-cooked meals. And I walk every day, about a mile, just around the neighborhood. It’s quite routine, really. I’ve been doing it for years. Perhaps… two miles on a good day, when the weather permits. But nothing excessive. It’s just… the number on the scale keeps going up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I believe it started sometime in… March, perhaps? It was gradual at first, barely noticeable. But over the past few months, it’s become more and more pronounced. I’d say… maybe ten pounds, at least, since March. It’s quite concerning, as I said. I haven't altered anything in my routine, and I'm usually quite… regular, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly six months of gradual weight gain, about ten pounds… and no changes in diet or exercise. Do you notice any other changes accompanying this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really, not at first. But now that you mention it… I have been feeling… a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not debilitatingly so, just… more sluggish. And I seem to be… colder, even when others are comfortable. It’s a subtle thing, but noticeable. And… oh, this might sound silly, but my skin feels drier, and my hair is… well, it’s just not as shiny as it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound silly at all. Those are all important things to note. Fatigue, feeling colder, and changes in skin and hair… Thank you for sharing those details. Now, before we move on, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I had… well, I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia about fifteen years ago, but I recovered fully. And I have… had occasional problems with my thyroid, according to my previous doctor in Lithuania, but it was never… serious enough to require ongoing treatment. Just a little… sluggish, she said, but it seemed to resolve on its own. I also had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, many years ago, but that is… well, that was a long time ago. I don’t believe it is relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia fifteen years ago, previous thyroid concerns, and a difficult childbirth. While the childbirth was some time ago, it's good to be aware of. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not any surgeries, thankfully. Just the usual… childhood vaccinations, and a wisdom tooth removed when I was young. Nothing major. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s good to have a complete picture. No surgeries, just vaccinations and a wisdom tooth extraction. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother had… heart problems, I believe. She passed away several years ago. And my father… he had diabetes, type two, I think it was called. And my brother, he… he struggles with high blood pressure. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and high blood pressure… that is helpful information, yes. It does increase your risk, so we'll keep that in mind. Now, before we continue, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… well, it’s rather simple, Doctor. I live with my husband, Stefan. He’s a retired carpenter, very good with his hands. We keep a small garden, mostly vegetables. I cook most of our meals at home, as I mentioned. We don’t smoke, and we rarely drink alcohol. I enjoy reading and… walking, of course. We don’t have much in the way of… excitement, but we are content. Is there anything specific you would like to know?
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good overview. Simple, healthy lifestyle, no smoking, limited alcohol. One last question regarding your medical history. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I haven’t taken any medication in… oh, goodness, I can’t even remember. Perhaps just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing regularly. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you see. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. So, no regular medications. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I have never had any reactions to anything, as far as I am aware. We eat a wide variety of foods, and I haven't noticed anything… problematic. Stefan is rather careful about pollen in the garden, but I haven’t had any serious allergies. I am quite fortunate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, Reneisha, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your thyroid gland to check for any enlargement. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I understand it is necessary to determine the cause of this… weight gain. I just hope… it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are a little faint, but nothing immediately concerning. Now, your thyroid feels a little enlarged. It's not dramatically so, but it's something we need to investigate further. Okay, Reneisha, thank you for your patience. Based on this preliminary examination, and your reported symptoms, I'm concerned about the possibility of hypothyroidism—an underactive thyroid. Your symptoms—fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, dry skin, and an enlarged thyroid—are all consistent with that condition. However, we need to confirm this with blood tests. I'll order a complete thyroid panel, including TSH, T4, and T3 levels. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism… an underactive thyroid… My previous doctor in Lithuania did mention something about my thyroid being… sluggish, as she put it, but she never said it was anything serious. Blood tests… yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause. Will the tests be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: No, the blood tests aren't painful at all. It's just a small prick of a needle, and it's over quickly. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to process everything. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available so we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as significant fatigue, difficulty breathing, or chest pain—please contact the clinic immediately. Given your family history of heart problems and your slightly elevated blood pressure, it’s important to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues as well. So, I’ll also order an EKG—an electrocardiogram—to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An EKG… and more tests… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… acceptable. If it’s necessary to rule things out, then please, proceed. Will I need a referral for the EKG? And… will insurance cover any of this? I… I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no insurance. We can certainly work with that. We have some programs available to assist patients without insurance, and we’ll do our best to minimize the costs. We may be able to get a discount for the blood tests and EKG. As for the EKG, we can perform it here in the clinic, so no referral is needed. I’ll also order a lipid panel—a cholesterol test—to assess your heart health. Given your family history, it's important to have a baseline understanding of your cholesterol levels. I’m going to write up these orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and… your kindness. It's just a lot to take in, all at once. I just hope… it’s nothing too serious. And that we can find a solution. Thank you again, Doctor. I suppose I will wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to ask if any questions come to mind later. The nurse will be in shortly. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We'll have answers soon.
