DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Christen. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's... well, it's nice to meet you as well. I've been feeling awfully thirsty lately, and hungry, even after I've eaten. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I'd like to finish this quickly if possible, I have a rather full schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks of increased thirst and hunger… I understand you’d like to be efficient with your time, and I’ll do my best. To get a better understanding, could you describe the thirst?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Right. Well, it's not like a dry mouth feeling, exactly. It’s more… a constant need to drink. I find myself reaching for water all the time, even if I’ve just had some. It’s not relieving it, not for long anyway. I suppose I just feel… dehydrated, constantly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A constant need, not relieved by drinking… and it’s been going on for weeks. And you mentioned increased hunger as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I eat a normal-sized meal, and I'm hungry again not long after. It's… unusual for me. I don’t usually have a large appetite, to be honest. I've actually put on a bit of weight, which is concerning. I suppose I'm eating more to try and feel full.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased thirst, increased hunger, and some weight gain over the past few weeks. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – how often you’re going, or the amount?
PATIENT: Urination… Hmm. Now that you mention it, yes, I suppose I have been going to the bathroom more often. Not drastically, but… more frequently than usual. And I think… yes, the amount is probably a bit more each time. I hadn’t really connected the two, to be honest. Is that… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these things. It’s not necessarily a “bad” sign, but it’s helpful information. We want to rule things out. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… My mother’s side, yes. My grandmother had it, I believe. And an aunt, perhaps. It was a long time ago, I don’t recall the specifics. As for other conditions… not that I’m aware of. I've always been fairly healthy, truthfully. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. Family history of diabetes does increase your risk. And yes, your insurance information is good to have on file. Now, just to complete a basic overview, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I’m quite a simple man, really. Can we… move things along? I have a shipment arriving this afternoon that needs my attention.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Then we can discuss some possible tests to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… acceptable. As quick as possible would be appreciated, Doctor. I understand it's necessary, but time is of the essence. I'd like to get this sorted out and get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, please have a seat on the table. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation. I'll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears and throat look normal. No signs of infection. Your weight is 93 kilograms, and your height is 170 centimeters, which gives you a BMI of 32.2. I’ll also check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… Now that you mention it, yes. Things seem a bit blurry sometimes, especially at night. I thought it was just the lighting, or perhaps I need new glasses. It’s not drastic, but noticeable. I hadn’t really connected that to anything else, truthfully. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very relevant. Blurry vision, especially at night, can be a symptom. Okay, based on what you’ve told me – increased thirst, increased hunger, weight gain, frequent urination, and blurry vision – along with the family history and the physical exam findings, it’s important we investigate the possibility of diabetes. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a fasting blood glucose and an HbA1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past few months. Do you have any concerns about having blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood tests… no, I have no objections to blood tests. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I'm not particularly fond of needles, but I understand it's necessary. When can I expect the results? And will this require a follow-up appointment? I really need to know so I can arrange my schedule.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will only take a few minutes. The lab usually has results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the results sent directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Yes, a follow-up appointment will likely be necessary to discuss the results and create a plan of action, depending on what we find. Let me see… I can tentatively schedule you for next Tuesday at 2 PM, unless that doesn’t work for you. Does that sound feasible?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2 PM… that should work, yes. I’ll need to double-check my schedule, but tentatively, yes. Please call first to confirm. I appreciate you trying to accommodate me, Doctor. Is there anything else? I'm rather eager to get this sorted out and return to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tuesday at 2 PM, with a confirmation call. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, but try not to overdo it. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – excessive fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or any cuts or sores that don’t heal – please contact the office immediately. Here's the lab requisition form. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of the blood draw. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your efficiency and… thoroughness. I’ll await your call regarding the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
