DOCTOR: Right. Noelani Stepro, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. It’s… pain. Down there. It’s been… a little while now, I think. A few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: "A few weeks." Vague, but alright. Pain, you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache? And sometimes it feels… heavy? It’s hard to describe. It’s… in the, um, the scrotum, I believe that’s what it’s called? I'm not very good with names for things. Does that make sense? It’s mostly on the left side, I think.
DOCTOR: Left-sided scrotal discomfort, dull ache, sensation of heaviness. And you're not a medical professional, I gather. Do you notice any swelling?
PATIENT: No, not a medical professional at all! I work with wood, mostly. Furniture and such. Swelling… hmm. I haven't really looked, if that makes sense. I mean, I've felt around a little, but I didn't notice anything obvious. I suppose it could be a little puffy, but I'm not sure if that's normal… honestly, I really don't know what is normal.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll have a look, then. It's best to be certain. Please, have a seat on the examination table and position yourself so I can properly assess the area. I need to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Please, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. I… I hope this won’t be too unpleasant. I’m not very good with… well, anything medical, really. Just let me know if I need to adjust… or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as possible. I’m going to palpate your scrotum, checking for any abnormalities. This will involve me gently feeling the area. It might be a little sensitive, but try to let me know if you experience any sharp pain. Hmm…I’m noting some tenderness on the left side, as you mentioned. No obvious masses at this point. The left testicle feels slightly…firm. Can you describe the pain in terms of a scale of one to ten, with one being minimal and ten being the worst pain you've ever experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, I feel that now. It’s… definitely more noticeable when you press there. A scale of one to ten… goodness. Let me think. It’s not awful, but it’s… distracting. Maybe a four? On a good day, it’s a two. When I’ve been moving around a lot, it goes up to a six, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A four to six, alright. And the lymph nodes…slightly enlarged on the left side. This, combined with the firmness of the testicle and the tenderness, warrants further investigation. It could be a number of things – an infection, inflammation, or something more concerning. I'm going to order a scrotal ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what’s going on internally. And I will order a urine analysis to rule out infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. “More concerning…” That doesn’t sound good. An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… thorough. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken anything recently, besides some ibuprofen for my back a few months ago, and I didn’t have any trouble with that. I’m generally quite healthy, really. I work with wood all day – keeps me moving!
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, no reaction. Fine. I’ll write the orders for the ultrasound and urine analysis now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll schedule you for the ultrasound as soon as possible. They will call you with the time and date. While we wait for the results, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity and lifting heavy objects. If you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, or notice any redness or swelling, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I understand. No heavy lifting… that will be difficult, but I can manage. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Right. It's just… a little unsettling, all this talk of “more concerning” things. It’s been so long since I’ve been to a doctor… everything feels a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s best to be cautious. We’re just covering all bases. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and contact you with a follow-up plan. I don't want to alarm you unnecessarily, but we need to rule out anything serious. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Not at the moment, anyway. Just… thank you for seeing me. And for explaining everything… even if it’s a little scary. I’ll try not to worry too much. And I'll be careful. Where do I go to schedule the ultrasound, you said?
DOCTOR: The scheduling desk is just outside, to your left. They’ll handle everything. And try to relax. It’s likely nothing serious. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you. You too.
