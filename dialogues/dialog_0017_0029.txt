DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's Norval, please. Well, it's a funny thing, really. I just... don't seem to be able to eat much these days. Get full awful quick, even with just a little bit of food. It's been going on for a few weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And this fullness… is it immediately after the first bite, or does it build up?
PATIENT: No, not immediately. I can usually get a few bites in, maybe five or six. But then, just… that’s it. Like someone flipped a switch. And it's not a painful full, just… uncomfortable. Like I’ve had enough, even though I haven’t. It's messing with my appetite, naturally. Not much point in trying to finish a plate if I know I'll just be pushing it around.
DOCTOR: Five or six bites, and then no further appetite. And you say this has impacted your overall appetite?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. I used to enjoy a good meal, you know? Always liked my salmon and potatoes. But now… I don’t even bother with seconds, and sometimes I skip meals altogether. My wife, bless her heart, keeps offering me things, but I just… don't have the room, you see? It's not that I don't want to eat, just… can't. I’m losing a bit of weight, I think, though I haven’t weighed myself lately.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… diminished appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No stomach pain, no nausea. No trouble swallowing, either. Just the early fullness. I’ve been a little tired lately, but I figured that was just getting old, you know? 88 years takes it out of a man. I sleep alright, though. No heartburn or anything like that. Honestly, it’s mostly just… frustrating. I like my food!
DOCTOR: “Tired,” you say. Can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, not like sick tired, Doctor. Just… sluggish. Like I don't have much energy. Used to be able to putter around in the garden all day, now I get winded pretty easy. And I nap more, I suppose. Afternoon naps, mostly. Always enjoyed a good afternoon snooze, but it seems I need ‘em more now. Not falling asleep during anything, just… more tired at the end of the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a one. Never really been much of a pill man. My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my joints, but I just refuse. Always figured I’d rather deal with a little ache than load up on chemicals, you know? Just take a bit of fish oil now and then, that's about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s perform a quick physical examination. I need to listen to your abdomen, feel for any masses, and check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. This old body doesn't move like it used to, you know.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Tympanic to percussion. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength appears normal in lower extremities. Skin turgor is slightly diminished, consistent with age. I'm going to check your thyroid now. Thyroid is normal to palpation.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That didn't seem too bad. Is everything alright so far? You’re awfully quiet. Makes an old man worry, you know. What are you looking for, exactly? Just curious.
DOCTOR: The examination was… unremarkable. Given your age, weight loss, and early satiety, and the lack of any alarming findings on physical exam, it could be something as simple as age-related changes in gastric emptying. However, given the potential for more serious underlying conditions—and I assure you, Mr. Obarr, at your age, there are many—we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll also need a stool sample to rule out any occult blood loss.
PATIENT: Oh. Occult blood loss? That doesn’t sound good, Doctor. Are you thinking it’s something serious? I just thought it was my appetite going off, you know? Getting old and all. What do these tests even look for? And a stool sample… now there’s a pleasant thought. Is it going to be expensive? My wife and I… well, we’re on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, I understand your concerns. Occult blood loss simply means blood in the stool that isn't visibly apparent. It's a common cause of unexplained weight loss and fatigue. The blood tests will assess your overall health, check your kidney and liver function, and rule out anemia. The stool sample will confirm or deny the presence of blood. As for the cost… I can't provide a precise estimate. However, given your insurance status, I can direct you to the billing department to discuss potential financial assistance programs. Here is the requisition form. Please take this to the lab as soon as possible. They will provide instructions for the stool sample. We'll review the results in one week. Until then, try to maintain a balanced diet as best you can, and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—particularly abdominal pain or vomiting—seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Financial assistance... yes, that would be good. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to worry too much, is what my wife always says. Well, thank you for your time. I’ll get this done as soon as I can. One week… alright. I appreciate you looking into it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the lab know you are a patient of mine. And do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. You may go now. Another one…
