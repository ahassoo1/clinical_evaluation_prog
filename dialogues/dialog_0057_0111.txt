DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. My wife insisted. Something about my skin… darkening, she says. And fatigue, though everyone gets tired as they age, don’t they? I work hard, you see. Reinforcing iron. Not a job for the faint of heart. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “Darkening skin” and fatigue… that's a good place to start. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the foggiest. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Time blurs, you understand. I’ve been… occupied. It’s not like it’s sudden, and frankly, I don’t recall paying much attention to my complexion until my wife brought it up. A man has more important things to worry about than the color of his skin.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been a gradual change, over weeks to months. And your wife noticed it before you did. Is it all over, or are there specific areas where you’ve noticed the darkening more?
PATIENT: Everywhere, I suppose. Arms, face… hands, probably. Really, Doctor, I don’t spend my days examining myself in the mirror. It’s all… a shade darker than usual, that’s all. And the tiredness is constant, but as I said, I work. A bit of fatigue is to be expected. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Okay, a general darkening of the skin, and constant fatigue. And you feel it's related to your work. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don't crave much these days. And… sometimes I feel a bit weak, a bit shaky. Nothing a good night’s sleep can’t fix, usually. Though, admittedly, good night’s sleep is a rare commodity. Is this important? It all seems rather… trivial.
DOCTOR: It's good you're mentioning these things, Mr. Drahota – nothing is trivial when it comes to your health. So, decreased appetite and occasional weakness or shakiness. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now there’s a question. My wife handles the scales, you see. She’s always fussing over my weight. I believe she said something about it being… less than it should be. A few pounds, perhaps? I honestly don't pay attention to such things. It's just… I don’t eat as much. Is that all? Can we be done soon?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds of weight loss, along with decreased appetite, fatigue, general skin darkening, and occasional weakness. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? At my age? Doctor, I've lived a long life. A few aches and pains, naturally. But nothing serious. No, no diabetes, no heart trouble, no… whatever else you were about to ask. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. A bit of tiredness doesn’t change that. And honestly, I don’t recall ever being “diagnosed” with anything. My wife handles all the doctor visits; I just show up when she tells me to. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay. And has your wife mentioned any past surgeries or hospitalizations you've had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. There was something, years ago. A… a problem with my appendix, I think. A long time ago. When I was much younger. And… perhaps a knee operation, after a fall at work. But it was a minor thing. Nothing significant. Really, Doctor, I’m not one for remembering details. My wife would know the specifics, if it matters. Are we any closer to a conclusion? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, so an appendectomy and a knee operation in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those pills and potions. A strong constitution and hard work are all a man needs. I take nothing. Not a single thing. And my wife wouldn't dare try to give me anything without my permission. I prefer to let nature take its course. Really, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, that’s a long story. My family… we came from China a long time ago. Lots of relatives. Some died young, some lived long lives. As for specific conditions… I have no idea. My mother and father passed away decades ago, and I didn’t pay much attention to their ailments. It was a different time. And frankly, I don't recall any particular family illnesses. Is this truly relevant? I'm feeling rather lightheaded. Can we wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: Okay. So limited information about family medical history. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! A respectable man does not engage in such foolishness. Never have, never will. It’s a disgusting habit. And frankly, I find the question rather… offensive. What sort of establishment is this? I assure you, my lungs are perfectly healthy, aside from the dust from the ironwork. Let’s move on, shall we? I’m growing increasingly impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. Nothing excessive. A small indulgence. My wife enjoys a bit as well. But I assure you, Doctor, I am not a heavy drinker. It’s not as if I’m sitting around all day with a bottle. It's just… a social thing. Now, are we nearing the end of this ordeal? I have appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol use. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. Do you work with any materials that might cause skin changes or affect your health?
PATIENT: Ah, now that’s a sensible question! Yes, of course. I work with iron, rebar… dust, dirt, all sorts of things. Construction work isn’t exactly a clean profession, you see. Years of handling metal, exposed to the elements. It’s likely that’s the cause of this… darkening, as my wife calls it. It’s probably just the dust. See? I told you it wasn't anything serious. Now, can we finally be done? I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for that information. Given your age, your work history, and the symptoms you’ve described – fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, and skin darkening – I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If it must be done. But please, be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. And be gentle, I’m not as young as I used to be. Just get it over with. And I trust you have thoroughly washed your hands?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I always wash my hands between patients. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin and check your abdomen. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily concerning given your age. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Your skin does appear darker than usual, particularly on your hands and forearms. And your abdomen is… slightly tender to the touch. Not acutely painful, but definitely some tenderness. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you usually have swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Now that you mention it, perhaps a little. I thought it was just the heat. It's been quite warm lately. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay close attention to such things. I’m a working man, not a hypochondriac. Are you finding anything… alarming? Because I assure you, I feel… reasonably well, all things considered. Just tired, as I’ve said repeatedly. Don’t go making a mountain out of a molehill, please. I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not making a mountain out of a molehill, Mr. Drahota, but your symptoms and the findings from the exam do warrant some further investigation. The fatigue, weight loss, skin darkening, abdominal tenderness, and ankle swelling… they could be due to a number of things. Given your age and lifestyle, I'm concerned about the possibility of a few different conditions. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, kidney function, and complete blood count. I also think it would be wise to get a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. And finally, I’d like to check your iron levels, given your profession. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a chest X-ray… Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite the ordeal. All this fuss over a bit of tiredness and darkened skin! But… very well. If you insist. Just get it over with as quickly as possible. But I’m warning you, I haven’t got all day. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a reputation to uphold, you see. Now, where do I go to get these… tests? And how long will this take? I have appointments, you understand. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Drahota. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray machine is in the building next door. The lab visit should take about 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray will probably be another 15-20 minutes. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. Just take this to the lab technician, and they’ll take care of it. After that, go to the radiology department in the next building, and they’ll schedule you for a chest X-ray. Here’s the address and phone number for the radiology department. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll have the nurse give you a call once the results are ready. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. And please, tell your nurse to be prompt. I haven't got all day to wait for phone calls. Honestly, this whole experience has been… thoroughly inconvenient. I’m a busy man. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments to keep. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand. Get the tests done when you can, and we’ll be in touch. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe fatigue, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
