DOCTOR: Well, hello Chellsea. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. It's been a little hard to keep everything straight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. My husband… he passed away from it last year. And now… well, I've been feeling unwell myself, and the tests showed something wasn’t right. I understand it’s cancer too, but I’m not entirely sure what kind. Or… what it means.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… a lot to process, understandably. Losing your husband so recently and then receiving this news… I’m sorry for your loss, and I understand why things might be a bit muddled. Let's try to get some clarity, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I have Medicare, if that matters. And I... I don't really know what questions to ask. Everything happened so fast with my husband, and I feel like I'm just… repeating that now.
DOCTOR: Medicare is good, yes. It will cover things. And it is overwhelming. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. Don't worry about asking 'silly' questions; there are no such things. Let's start with this 'something' that the tests showed. Do you happen to remember what the tests were, or what part of your body they were looking at?
PATIENT: I had… a lot of scans. Like, of my chest, and my belly. And they took some blood. The doctor at the other hospital said something about a lump… in my lung, I think? But honestly, I was still… very upset then. It’s all a bit blurry. I don’t remember the exact name of the scans, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Right. Chest and abdominal scans… a lump in the lung. Okay. Vague recollections are… common in these situations. So, they found a lump. Has anyone discussed the size of this lump with you?
PATIENT: No, they didn't mention size. Just that it was… there. And that it needed further investigation. They sent me here, to you. I… I don’t really know what ‘further investigation’ even means, if I’m being honest. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a bad thing, Chellsea. 'Further investigation' just means we need to get a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. We need to know exactly what this lump is, how big it is, and whether it’s spread anywhere else. It’s standard procedure. Now, have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… yes. I’ve been very tired. More tired than usual. And I’ve had a cough, but I thought it was just a cold at first. It doesn't really go away. And sometimes… sometimes I get a little short of breath, even when I’m just walking around the house. Is that… related?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, persistent cough, shortness of breath… yes, those could certainly be related. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tiredness has been slowly getting worse for maybe… three months, I think? The cough started about a month ago. And the shortness of breath… it’s only really been in the last couple of weeks, maybe. It's not bad all the time, just… when I exert myself. Or sometimes, even just thinking about walking up the stairs. It's silly, probably.
DOCTOR: It's not silly. Any change in your breathing is worth noting. And three months of increasing fatigue… Alright. Have you had any chest pain, or noticed any blood when you cough?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And no blood when I cough. Just a… regular cough. Sometimes it feels a little tight in my chest, but not… painful. It’s more like a squeezing feeling, if that makes sense. It comes and goes. And… I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tightness in the chest, unintentional weight loss… You mentioned your husband. Did he have any similar symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes… he had the cough first. And the tiredness. And he did lose a lot of weight. It happened very quickly with him. He also had… pain in his back, towards the end. That's why we went to the hospital. He kept complaining about his back hurting. It turned out to be… well, it doesn't matter now. But it was the cancer, of course. It had spread. I'm sorry, I'm getting upset.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's understandable you're upset. His experience is… relevant, but we're dealing with you now. And everyone presents differently. Now, have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he smoked for a long time, but I always told him to stop. It didn't seem to bother him much, until… well, until it did. I always stayed away from it. I don't understand why this is happening to me, if I haven’t smoked. Is it… is it hereditary?
DOCTOR: Sometimes. It can be. Now, let's talk about your family history. Did anyone else in your family have cancer?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had breast cancer, a long time ago. But she was very old when she got it. And… I think my uncle had some kind of cancer too, but I don't remember what kind. It was a long time ago, and we didn't see him very often. It wasn't something we talked about much. I don't know if it was the same kind as… this. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I don’t take any medication regularly. Just… over-the-counter things, like pain relievers when I have a headache. Nothing special. I haven't had to go to the doctor much in my life, thankfully. Until now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we need to get some further imaging done, to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. And we'll need to discuss a biopsy. That's the only way to definitively determine what we're dealing with. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A biopsy? What’s… what does that involve? Is it painful? I don’t like the sound of that, if I’m being honest. Is it… is it necessary? Can’t we just… wait and see? I’m still trying to process everything.
DOCTOR: Waiting and seeing isn’t an option, Chellsea. Cancer doesn’t simply go away on its own. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the tissue from your lung, which is then examined under a microscope to determine the type of cancer, if any. It's typically done with a needle, under local anesthesia. There will be some discomfort, yes, but it's generally well-tolerated. It’s necessary to know what we’re dealing with before we can determine the best course of treatment. We have to be proactive. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. A needle… into my lung. It sounds frightening. Is there anything I can do to prepare for it? And… what if it is cancer? What happens then? I'm sorry, I'm probably asking silly questions. But I just… I don't want to go through what my husband went through.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to be concerned. Now, to prepare, you’ll need to fast for a few hours beforehand, and we'll likely do some blood work to ensure you're healthy enough for the procedure. As for what happens if it’s cancer… well, that depends on the type and stage. We’ll discuss all your options. Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery… we’ll determine the best course of action together. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, we need to get the biopsy. Do you have any other immediate concerns?
