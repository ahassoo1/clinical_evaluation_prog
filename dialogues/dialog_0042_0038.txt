DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I need to… arrange some paperwork? Regarding future… well, decisions about my care, should I become unable to make them myself. I was advised to seek an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form, but honestly, the details are a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly reasonable. Advance care planning – things like Advance Directives and POLST forms – can be a little daunting. It's very responsible of you to think about this now. Just to clarify, are you feeling unwell currently, or is this entirely proactive planning for a possible future situation?
PATIENT: No, no, not unwell at all. Entirely proactive, yes. Though… my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s… difficult to recall exactly why I felt it was so pressing, beyond a general sense of… preparedness. A friend mentioned it, I think, after a difficult situation with their parent. It’s all rather… fragmented. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not at all a problem. It’s very common for things to feel fragmented when you’re thinking about future possibilities. And it’s excellent that you’re acting on a concern, even if the details aren’t perfectly clear. So, let's break it down. You're interested in discussing Advance Directives and POLST forms – those are both related to ensuring your wishes are respected if you become unable to communicate them yourself. Do you have any initial thoughts on which one might be more appropriate, or are you completely unfamiliar with the difference?
PATIENT: Completely unfamiliar, I’m afraid. I recall something about one being… more comprehensive? And the other… for immediate situations? But beyond that… it’s all rather blurred. Perhaps you could explain the differences in… simpler terms? I apologize for my lack of clarity. It's… frustrating, even to me.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Evann, please don’t apologize. It is a complex topic, and it’s perfectly okay to not be familiar with the details. Let’s start with the Advance Directive. Think of it as a broad plan for your future healthcare. It allows you to write down the types of medical care you would – or would not – want if you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself. It covers a wide range of possibilities. A POLST form – which stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It’s essentially a medical order, based on your current wishes, and it focuses on immediate medical decisions, like whether or not you want CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It’s often used by people with serious illnesses. Does that distinction make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. The Advance Directive sounds… more long-term, a general outline. And the POLST form is… for right now, should something acute happen. I think… given my… fragmented recollections, perhaps the Advance Directive would be the more suitable option? To establish a broader framework, rather than immediate orders I may not… fully understand at the moment?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable approach, Evann. An Advance Directive allows us to really explore your values and wishes without the pressure of an immediate medical crisis. To start, we’ll need to identify someone you trust to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are unable to. This is called a healthcare proxy or durable power of attorney for healthcare. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A proxy… yes. That… that is difficult. My… my marriage ended some time ago, and we are not… on amicable terms. I have a cousin, perhaps? Naraa. She is… reliable, I believe. Though we haven’t spoken frequently in recent years. Is… is it permissible to nominate someone with whom I have limited contact? I wouldn't want to… burden her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful question, Evann. Yes, it is absolutely permissible to nominate someone with whom you have limited contact, as long as they are willing and able to fulfill the role. It’s more important that they understand your values and wishes, even if you don't speak frequently. It would be ideal to discuss this with Naraa beforehand, to ensure she is comfortable with the responsibility. We can also list alternate proxies, in case your first choice is unavailable. Would you like to provide me with her contact information so we can potentially reach out?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that would be… prudent. Her number is… 555-1234. Naraa Bold, in Ulaanbaatar. She may be difficult to reach, given the time difference. And… she speaks very little English. Would that… present a problem? I apologize for the complications. It seems I am… perpetually creating them.
DOCTOR: You're not creating complications at all, Evann. These are all important considerations, and we can absolutely work through them. The language barrier is something we'll need to address. We can explore options such as utilizing a professional medical interpreter during any discussions with Naraa, or ensuring the Advance Directive document is translated into Mongolian. We'll also document the language barrier clearly. Let's focus on outlining your wishes first. To start, can you tell me about your general values regarding medical treatment?
PATIENT: Values… I believe… quality of life is paramount. Prolonging existence at all costs… that is not my preference. Comfort… dignity… those are important. I… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive by machines if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. And… I would prefer to be at home, if possible, rather than in a hospital. Though… I understand that may not always be feasible. Is that… sufficient? I fear I am rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that’s excellent. That’s a very clear and thoughtful starting point, Evann. You’ve articulated your priorities beautifully. So, you prioritize quality of life, dignity, and prefer comfort care over aggressive life-sustaining treatments, and a home environment if possible. We’ll document all of that. Now, let’s get a bit more specific. Thinking about different medical scenarios, would you want aggressive interventions like CPR if your heart stopped, or would you prefer a “do not resuscitate” order?
PATIENT: CPR… That… that is a difficult question. I’ve seen… I’ve seen the aftermath. The… the potential for broken bones, the… the lack of lasting benefit. I think… I think I would prefer a "do not resuscitate" order. Unless… unless there is a reasonable expectation of full recovery. But if it’s… if it’s simply prolonging the inevitable… then no. Thank you. That… that was difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: You’re articulating it perfectly, Evann. It's good that it's difficult – it means you're giving serious thought to these important decisions. So, we'll document your preference for a "do not resuscitate" order in situations where there is no reasonable expectation of full recovery. We will also include specific guidance on what constitutes a "reasonable expectation," to provide clarity for your healthcare proxy and medical team. Now, let's move on to artificial nutrition and hydration. If you were unable to eat or drink, would you want a feeding tube, or would you prefer to allow nature to take its course?
PATIENT: A feeding tube… That… that feels… invasive. And… undignified. I believe… I believe I would prefer to allow nature to take its course. Unless… unless it’s a temporary situation, and there’s a reasonable expectation of recovery. But if it’s… if it’s long-term… then no. I… I apologize. I feel as though I am being morbid. Is this… normal? It’s all so… unsettling.
DOCTOR: You are not being morbid at all, Evann. This is a very normal and healthy part of the advance care planning process. It's unsettling to think about these things, but it’s incredibly responsible of you to do so. So, we'll document your preference against long-term artificial nutrition and hydration, with the caveat that you would consider it for temporary situations with a reasonable expectation of recovery. We've covered a lot today – your values, preferences regarding CPR and artificial nutrition. We also have your healthcare proxy information. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… yes. What happens next? Will this document… be automatically available to emergency personnel if… if something were to happen? And… how often should I review it? My… my memory, as you know, is… unreliable. I wouldn’t want it to be… outdated. And… is there a cost associated with this? I apologize for the practical questions. I feel as though I am being… demanding.
DOCTOR: You're not being demanding at all, Evann. These are excellent and very important questions. Let's address them one by one. Once the Advance Directive is completed and signed, we will ensure it’s readily available in your medical record, and we can also provide you with copies to keep with you or share with loved ones. In the event of an emergency, emergency personnel will do their best to locate it, but it's not always guaranteed. We can also discuss a medical alert bracelet or necklace indicating you have an Advance Directive. Regarding review, it's generally recommended to review your Advance Directive at least annually, or whenever there is a significant change in your health or values. Given your concerns about memory, I suggest we schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to revisit this, and perhaps involve Naraa in that discussion, if she’s willing. As for cost, there is no direct cost for completing the Advance Directive itself. However, if you choose to have it notarized, there may be a small fee associated with that. We can provide you with information about local notaries. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that is very reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. You have… alleviated a great deal of my anxiety. The follow-up appointment… in six months… that sounds… prudent. And… yes, involving Naraa… perhaps that would be best. She is… responsible, if a little… distant. Thank you again, Doctor. I believe… I believe that is all for now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. We’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for six months from today. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and have a good day.
