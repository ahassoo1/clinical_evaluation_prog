DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, honestly? It’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood. Not a ton, but enough to worry me. It started a couple days ago, just after a meal. Thought it was something I ate at first, but it keeps happening. And it’s…well, you can imagine. Not a good look.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. That certainly sounds concerning, and you were right to come in. Vomiting blood is never something to ignore. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you want to know? It's...red. Darker red, mostly. Not bright, like you'd see in a movie. And it usually happens maybe an hour or so after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, steak, doesn't make a difference. I haven’t been feeling particularly sick before it happens, just… normal. A little tired, maybe, but who isn’t these days? I’m not one for complaining, you understand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Gentz. It’s good you’re here, and it’s helpful to know it’s darker red, not bright red, and that it occurs roughly an hour after eating regardless of the food. You mentioned feeling a little tired – has that been a recent change, or is that typical for you?
PATIENT: Typical. Always been a bit of a…slow starter, if you get what I mean. Not much energy, never have been. But it's maybe a little more noticeable lately, I suppose. And I’ve been…well, I lost my wife last year. It throws you off, you know? Everything just feels…flat. Don’t think that’s got anything to do with the…situation, though. Just being honest. Don’t want you wasting time on…feelings.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly reasonable that you'd be feeling…flat, as you put it. Grief can certainly impact many aspects of our well-being, and I assure you, I’m not dismissing that at all. However, it’s important to rule out any physical causes for the vomiting blood, and the fatigue could be related. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My stomach’s been a bit… unsettled, I guess. Not really painful, just… queasy. And I’ve been… more thirsty than usual, maybe? Though living out here, you’re always a bit dehydrated. It gets hot, you know? I haven’t really… paid much attention, to be honest. I'm not one for fussing over little things. I just… deal with it. I’ve also been… passing black, tarry stools. That started around the same time as the… other thing. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, that is important. Black, tarry stools are a significant finding. Along with the vomiting blood, that suggests there may be bleeding in your digestive tract. I want to examine you now, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and I’ll need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. We may also need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications or sensitivities I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had much luck with… well, anything medical, if I’m being honest. Makes me nervous, all that poking and prodding. But fine, go ahead. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it, if you can. And explain what you're doing as you go, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand your apprehension, and I will explain everything as I go. We’ll take things at your pace. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me assess the sounds within your stomach and intestines. Take a few deep breaths for me. The sounds are a little… diminished. Not alarming, but something we’ll keep in mind. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. You’re being gentle enough, I suppose. Diminished sounds… what does that mean? Is it bad? Don’t tell me it’s something serious. I’ve got enough on my plate as it is. And don't waste time on feelings, alright? Just the facts. Numbers, what’s wrong, what you’re going to do about it. I’m a practical man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, and your pulse is slightly elevated. Temperature is normal. Diminished bowel sounds can indicate a slowing down of the digestive process, which, in the context of the vomiting blood and black stools, is concerning. Based on what you've told me, and these initial findings, I'm concerned about potential bleeding in your upper digestive tract. It could be caused by a number of things - an ulcer, gastritis, or something else. We need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count to assess your red blood cell levels, and tests to check your liver and kidney function. We will also need a stool sample to confirm the presence of blood and rule out other infections. And I believe a CT scan of your abdomen would be prudent to visualize your organs and look for any obvious sources of bleeding. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: CT scan… that means radiation, doesn't it? And blood work… poke and prod again. And a stool sample… well, that's just… undignified. Look, I’m not a fan of all this fuss. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just… give me something to stop the bleeding? Something to settle my stomach? I’m a simple man. I don’t need all this… modern medicine. Honestly, I’ve always been suspicious of doctors.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your hesitation and your concerns about the tests and the radiation exposure. I assure you, we use the lowest possible dose of radiation for a CT scan, and the benefits of identifying the cause of the bleeding far outweigh the risks in this situation. Unfortunately, I can’t simply “give you something to stop the bleeding” without knowing where the bleeding is coming from. That’s why these tests are so crucial. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health, and the CT scan will help us pinpoint the source of the bleeding so we can determine the appropriate treatment. Without a diagnosis, any medication I prescribe could potentially mask the symptoms or even worsen the underlying problem. I want to provide you with the best possible care, and that requires a thorough investigation. Given your location in a rural area, accessing specialist care may be challenging. If we confirm significant bleeding, I will need to refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and possible endoscopy. Would you be comfortable with me proceeding with the blood work and ordering the CT scan?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your poking and prodding. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And don’t tell me about all the… technical details. I don’t need a lecture on radiology. Just… tell me when and where to go. And keep it quick, alright? I've got things to do. And no talk about… feelings. Just the results.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I respect your wishes. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood samples now. They'll take you to a separate room for that. And I'll send the order to the radiology department for the CT scan. They will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. It's usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication called pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. This will help reduce the acid in your stomach, which may help alleviate some of the discomfort and potentially slow down the bleeding. It’s not a cure, but it can provide some temporary relief. If you experience any worsening of the vomiting – particularly if it’s profuse or contains a large amount of blood – or if you feel dizzy or weak, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the medication, or about what to expect during the tests?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the pills. How many, when? And don't tell me about side effects. I don't want to hear it. Just… practical instructions. And make sure this lab technician is gentle. I don’t like needles. Honestly, the whole lot of you… poking and prodding, asking questions, wasting my time. It's a nuisance, that's what it is. A complete nuisance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. One pill of pantoprazole, 40 milligrams, once daily, in the morning, with breakfast. I’ll send the prescription to your local pharmacy. They can advise you on any potential interactions with other medications you may be taking. I will also make a note to ensure the lab technician is aware of your anxiety regarding needles and will ask them to be as gentle as possible. I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you, we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. Once we have the results from the blood work and CT scan, we'll discuss them with you in detail and develop a plan. If you have any immediate concerns before your appointment with the radiologist, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll have the lab technician come in now. Is there anything else I can assist you with before they arrive?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just get it over with. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already. And tell that technician… don't talk. I don’t want to hear about their day, or their training, or anything. Just… draw the blood and be done with it. And keep it quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I will inform the technician of your preferences. I’ll let them know you would prefer a quiet procedure. Thank you for your patience. We'll take good care of you. .
