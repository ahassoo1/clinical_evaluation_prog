DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… business. Down there. Saw some red in the bowl this morning. Not a good sign, not a good sign at all. I’ve had a good constitution my whole life, you know. Flew all over the world, ate all sorts of things… never a problem. Now this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Seeing blood can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood you saw?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was red, of course! Blood is red! Is this what they train you doctors to ask these days? Honestly. But… alright, alright. It wasn’t… bright red. More like… dark. And it wasn’t a lot, mind you. Just… streaks. Mixed in with everything else. Like someone took a paintbrush to it. A small paintbrush, thankfully. Still… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. Darker blood often suggests it’s been in the system a bit longer. And you mentioned streaks, not a large amount. Have you noticed this before, even a tiny bit, or is this the first time you’ve seen this?
PATIENT: First time. Absolutely the first time. I told you, I’ve been remarkably healthy. Used to be, a man could eat anything. Now look at us. Asking about the color of… well, you know. Honestly, I haven't been bothered by anything like this before. Maybe it was something I ate? Though I can’t imagine what. I had a perfectly good roast chicken last night. From the butcher, mind you. Not one of those factory things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re paying attention to any changes. A roast chicken is unlikely to be the cause, but we’ll explore all possibilities. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… alright. A bit tired, perhaps. But I’m eighty-eight years old! What do you expect? I’m not bouncing around like a spring chicken, you know. My stomach… maybe a little rumblin’ this morning, but I always get a bit of rumblin’ after a meal. Nothing out of the ordinary. No pain, no… nothing drastic. Just the red, and frankly, it’s unsettling. A man shouldn’t have to worry about this.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good to hear you’re not experiencing any pain. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Good Lord. Now you're asking about… well. I go when I need to go. Always have. Sometimes a bit loose, sometimes a bit… firm. It's natural! What does a doctor even need to know about this? I haven't been constipated, if that's what you're getting at. And I haven't been… running to the bathroom all day, either. Just normal. Relatively normal. For an eighty-eight-year-old, of course. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m asking rather personal questions, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s simply to rule out any potential causes. Knowing your normal bowel habits is important. You mentioned everything is relatively normal for someone your age, and that's good to know. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that’s a good question. Actually… come to think of it, my trousers have been a bit looser lately. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough that I had to tighten the belt a notch. Thought it was just getting older, you know? Muscles shrinking and all that. Didn’t think anything of it. But yes, I suppose I have lost a bit of weight. Not a dramatic amount. Enough to notice, maybe. Is that… bad? Is everything bad these days?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Rowbottom. Weight loss, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate further. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, now. That's a question. Let me see. Back in '62, I broke my wrist when I was landing a Cessna in a bit of a squall. Nothing serious, a good cast fixed it right up. And I had a touch of the flu, back in '87, nasty business that was. Other than that… no. Never been one for doctors, you see. Always figured a good stiff drink and a bit of rest would cure what ailed me. Never had anything serious. No heart trouble, no high blood pressure… I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Flew for forty years without a hitch. I'm telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. A bad oyster, maybe. Though I haven’t had an oyster in years.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. No significant medical history is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think... Well, when I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out. That was... a long time ago. And I had a mole removed from my back a few years back. Nothing major, the doctor just snipped it off. Other than that, no. Never been one for going under the knife. I always figured if it ain't broke, don't fix it. A man should be able to handle a few aches and pains, you know? It builds character. What are you getting at, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? Because frankly, I haven't got time for a lot of fuss. I've got a model airplane to finish.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate your patience. You've had a very active and healthy life, which is wonderful. Given the recent change you've observed – the blood in your stool and the unintentional weight loss – I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. It’s important to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical examination. Now you're getting to it. Well... alright. But don't go poking and prodding too much. I'm an old man, you know. Bones aren't what they used to be. And no funny business. Just a quick look, and then tell me what you think. I haven’t got all day, Doctor. And frankly, I'm not particularly thrilled about this whole thing. But if you think it's necessary... go ahead. But be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll palpate your abdomen. I’ll also need to do a quick digital rectal exam, which will allow me to check for any abnormalities. It’s a standard procedure, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath for me…
