DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is very kind of you to meet me. I am here today… well, my niece thinks I should be. She wants me to be cleared for a place where… where older folks live. A senior living facility, she calls it. I am Lennie Tkac, by the way. I bake, mostly. Have done so for… a very long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, I see here you are Lennie Tkac. And it sounds like your niece is concerned about your health and wants to ensure you’re able to transition smoothly into a senior living facility. That’s very thoughtful of her. So, to be clear, she’s requested a medical clearance for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. She worries, you see. Always has. A good woman, my niece, but… full of worry. She says I have been… forgetting things. But I remember quite well, actually. Details, mostly. Dates, names… the best way to bake a cherry pie, for example. But a medical clearance… yes, that is why I am here. To satisfy her worries, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tkac. It’s perfectly normal for families to have concerns, and it's good you're here to address them. We'll do a thorough assessment to get a clear picture of your overall health and memory. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I am… eighty-one years of age. My bones ache a bit, especially when the weather turns cold. I have a touch of arthritis, the doctor back home said, years ago. Otherwise, I feel… sturdy enough. I still bake every day, you see. Cherry pies, apple crisps, sourdough bread… keeps me moving. I do not take many medicines. Just a little something for my blood pressure, a small blue pill, once a day. And I have had… well, I had a fall last winter. Not a bad one, thankfully. Just a bit bruised.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That's helpful. So, arthritis and managed blood pressure. And a fall last winter – was that here in your current location, or back home?
PATIENT: The fall was back home, Doctor. In my kitchen, actually. Slipped on a bit of flour, I believe. Old age, you see. Not much one can do about it. Thankfully, nothing was broken. Just a fright, mostly. I was quite lucky. My niece… she wanted me to move closer to her after that. Said I needed someone nearby. Which is why I am here now, closer to her and… all of this.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a sensible decision to move closer to family after a fall. And it's good that nothing was broken. Now, regarding the blue pill for your blood pressure – do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: That is… a good question, Doctor. My niece handles most of that, you see. I just take the small blue pill every morning with my coffee. I… believe it is Lisinopril? Is that correct? She keeps the bottles, you see. I do not fuss with such things. I focus on the baking.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, okay. That’s very helpful. We can confirm that with your records. Now, Mr. Tkac, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or lung disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have always been… a sturdy man, as I said. The doctor back home checked me regularly, for many years. He said my lungs were strong, good for shouting at the horses, he said. And my heart… he said it beat strong and true. He never mentioned anything about… diabetes, or any other troubles. I do enjoy a sweet treat, from time to time, a slice of cherry pie, perhaps, but nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Tkac. And it sounds like you had a good doctor back home. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, let me see… Years ago, when I was a young man, I had my tonsils taken out. A very common thing, I believe, back then. And… I was hospitalized briefly when I was a boy, with a bad case of the measles. A very unpleasant illness, I recall. Otherwise… no, I have not had any surgeries or been hospitalized as an adult. I have been fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Mostly just the occasional ache and pain, as one gets older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Tkac. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my mother lived to be eighty-seven. A strong woman, she was. She died peacefully, in her sleep. My father… he was a rancher. He passed away when I was still a young man, from a heart ailment, I believe. As for siblings… I had two brothers and a sister. One brother passed away a few years ago, also from heart trouble. My other brother is still living, he's ninety-one, living on the reservation. And my sister… she passed away several years ago, from… well, I believe it was pneumonia. As for any… inherited conditions, I don't recall my family having any particular troubles. They were mostly sturdy folk, like myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That's very helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Never will. My father… he smoked a pipe, from time to time, but he discouraged me from it. Said it was a foolish habit. I have always preferred the clean air, you see. Good for the lungs, he said. And for shouting at horses.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Very little, Doctor. A sip of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. My niece… she keeps a bottle of sherry in the cupboard. But I do not drink often. It… doesn't agree with me. Makes me a bit sleepy, you see. I prefer a glass of water, with my baking. Keeps me alert.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, I understand you live here in a suburban area now, closer to your niece. Can you tell me a little bit about your daily routine and how much physical activity you get?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I live with my niece, in a small house with a garden. I bake every day, of course. That keeps me moving. I also tend to the garden, from time to time. Not as much as I used to, my bones ache, you see. I take a short walk around the neighborhood most days, weather permitting. Perhaps a mile or so. And I… I enjoy sitting on the porch, watching the birds. A peaceful pastime, you see. Keeps me calm. My niece… she encourages me to stay active, but I do what I can. It's a slower pace these days, you see.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely routine, Mr. Tkac. It's good you're staying active and enjoying the outdoors. Now, to finish up the medical history portion, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have always been… a sturdy man, as I said. I can eat most anything. I have never had any trouble with food, or with medicines. I have never had any… hives, or swelling, or difficulty breathing. I have always been fortunate in that regard. My niece… she always asks, of course, before she gives me anything new, but I have never had any troubles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I have always believed in regular check-ups. It is best to know what is going on, you see. I am a sturdy man, but even sturdy men need looking after, from time to time. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'd be so kind, please have a seat here on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. And could you tell me if you’ve had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will sit. As for my weight… no, not much change, I do not believe. I have always been… a fairly consistent weight. Perhaps a pound or two, depending on the season, but nothing drastic. My niece… she worries about my weight, from time to time, but I assure her, I am eating quite well. Mostly cherry pie. And sourdough bread. Keeps me sturdy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Your blood pressure is 138 over 72, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 78, which is also within a normal range. Your heart sounds strong and regular, and your lungs are clear. Do you have any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not here. A bit of a tickle, perhaps, but nothing unpleasant. You have a gentle touch, Doctor. I appreciate that. It is reassuring.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about your abdomen?
PATIENT: No pain there either, Doctor. A little bit firm, perhaps, but nothing unusual. I do enjoy a good meal, you see. Keeps me sturdy. And my niece… she is a good cook. Keeps me well-fed.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are good, and your strength is adequate in all limbs. And your gait appears steady. Overall, your physical exam is quite good for your age, Mr. Tkac. However, given your niece's concerns about potential memory changes, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment, if you don't mind. It’s a simple test, just a few questions to assess your short-term memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand my niece is concerned. I have no objection to a test, if it will satisfy her worries. I believe in thoroughness, you see. And I do not mind answering a few questions, if it will help. Proceed, please. I will do my best. Though I must say, I remember quite well, details mostly. Dates, names… the best way to bake a cherry pie, for example.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Tkac. I'm confident you'll do just fine. We'll start with something simple. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The current date is… August 2nd, 2025. A Tuesday, is it not? I always keep track of the days. Important for baking, you see. Proper timing is essential for a good sourdough loaf.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s correct. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. We are in your clinic. A very pleasant clinic, I must say. Suburban, you told me. With comfortable chairs and… a calming atmosphere. I believe it is called Jaso Abady’s clinic? Though I am not entirely certain. My niece brought me, you see. She handles the details.
DOCTOR: That's correct. Very good. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Proceed, please. I have a good memory, you see. Though details, mostly. Names, dates… the proper temperature for baking a cherry pie. Tell me the three words.
DOCTOR: Okay. Table, penny, cloud. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Let me see… table, penny… and cloud. Is that correct? I believe I have remembered them. Though details, mostly. It is important to remember details, you see. Especially when baking.
DOCTOR: That's correct, Mr. Tkac! Excellent memory. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question: What year is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The year is… 2025. A good year for cherries, I believe. Plenty of sunshine and rain. Perfect for baking. And my niece… she says it is a good year for senior living facilities. Though I am not entirely certain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tell me who is the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… a difficult question. My niece watches the news, you see. She tells me such things. Let me see… is it… Biden? Joseph Biden? I believe that is correct. Though I do not follow politics closely. I prefer baking, you see. More straightforward.
DOCTOR: That's correct, Mr. Tkac. Very good. Now, one final question. I'm going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10:10. I’ll provide a piece of paper and a pen. Don't worry about it being perfect, just do your best.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A clock, you say? Showing ten ten? I am not much of an artist, you see. Mostly a baker. But I will do my best. There. Is that sufficient? I always focus on timing, you see. Important for baking. Though drawing… that is not my specialty.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That’s perfectly fine. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that concludes the brief cognitive assessment. Overall, your responses were generally good, and you remembered most of the information correctly. However, there were a few minor difficulties with the clock drawing and some slight hesitancy with some of the questions. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as stress, anxiety, or simply normal age-related changes. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it does warrant further investigation. I would like to order a few simple blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your cognitive function. And I'd also like to recommend a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation with a neurologist for a more detailed assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly reasonable. If my niece is worried, then I am willing to undergo further investigation. Blood tests, you say? And a visit to a neurologist? I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will satisfy her worries, then I am willing to do whatever is necessary. I have always believed in thoroughness, you see. And I do not mind undergoing a few tests, if it will ensure my well-being. Proceed, please. Though I still believe I remember quite well, details mostly. Dates, names… the best way to bake a cherry pie. But I understand your concerns, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Tkac. I appreciate your willingness to proceed with further testing. I’ll order the blood tests right away, and I’ll give you a referral to a neurologist in the area. The neurologist will schedule an appointment with you at their earliest convenience. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your current routine and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Now, regarding your request for medical clearance for the senior living facility, I will provide a report to your niece outlining your overall health status, the results of the blood tests, and the recommendations from the neurologist. It is my professional opinion, at this time, that you are generally healthy enough to consider moving into a senior living facility, pending the results of the further investigations. However, it is important to ensure that you have adequate support and monitoring in place, especially given the minor cognitive difficulties that were observed. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Pending the results, you say? And adequate support and monitoring? I trust your judgment, Doctor. My niece… she will be pleased to hear that I am generally healthy enough. She worries so much. And she will undoubtedly ensure that I have adequate support. She is very thorough, you see. I am willing to proceed with the investigations, Doctor. And I thank you for your careful assessment. Please, let me know if there is anything I can do to help. Though I still believe I remember quite well, details mostly. Dates, names… the best way to bake a cherry pie. But I understand your concerns, Doctor. And I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I will have the lab order and the neurologist referral ready for you before you leave. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. And please, continue to enjoy your baking – it sounds like a wonderful pastime! I will see you again soon, Mr. Tkac. Take care.
