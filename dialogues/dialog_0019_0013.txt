DOCTOR: Good morning, Dondre. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Renzi. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not real bad, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with completely emptying your bladder, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Feels like… like there’s always a little bit left in there, even after I’ve tried. It doesn’t hurt, not usually. Just… frustrating, you know? And I worry about getting an infection or something.
DOCTOR: I do understand, that sounds concerning, and it's good you’re getting it checked out. Frustration is definitely a valid symptom! Now, about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, just now and then. But it’s been more regular lately, the last month or so. Not every time, but… most times, I’d say. I don’t keep a calendar of it, if that helps. Just how it feels.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright – how it feels is very helpful. Three to four months… okay. And can you tell me a little bit about how you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Well… I just go when I have to go. Like anyone, I guess. I don’t… push or strain, not unless it’s been a long time. I try to relax. Sometimes it starts easy, sometimes it takes a minute. I don't rush myself. Is there a right way? I just… go. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Dondre. No, there isn’t necessarily a right way, just what works best for you. You mentioned it doesn’t usually hurt, but have you noticed any burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not at all. It’s not painful. Just… incomplete, like I said. And sometimes… a little dribbling after I think I’m done. Not a lot, but enough to have to… well, you know. Change my clothes sometimes. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Dondre, but you’re here and we can figure this out. No need to be embarrassed with me. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're needing to go to the bathroom, besides the incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: No, not really. I go about the same amount as always, I think. Maybe a little more during the day, now that I think about it. But I drink a good bit of water, you know? Always have. It’s hard to say if that’s the reason, or… the other thing. I don’t wake up at night to go, thankfully. That would be… awful.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you're not waking up at night. Okay, drinking a good amount of water is good. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must be… twenty years now? And I have a little bit of trouble with my knees, getting older, you know? But nothing serious. The doctor just tells me to stay active. I take a little medicine for high blood pressure, but that’s it, really. I had a wife, but she passed away a few years back. That was… hard. Does that count as a medical problem?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Dondre. That absolutely counts as something that impacts your health and wellbeing. It’s important to acknowledge those things. And thank you for sharing all of that with me. So, just to clarify: gallbladder removed 20 years ago, some knee trouble, and medication for high blood pressure. What’s the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it in my wallet. Ah, here it is. It’s… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take a little ibuprofen. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to say I could eat anything. She worried about me trying new foods. I don't wear any jewelry, so I don’t have to worry about metal allergies. I don’t have any trouble with pollen or anything like that, either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I broke my arm when I was a boy, but that just healed up on its own with a cast. No operations or anything like that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Keep things simple. It’s better that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… trouble with her heart when she got older. Had to have some procedures done. And my father… he had diabetes. But he didn’t take care of himself, always eating sweets. He didn’t live very long. My wife’s side of the family… I don’t know much about them, really. We didn’t see them much. Is that helpful? It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Dondre. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father… that’s good information. Okay. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. Nothing regular. And no, I don't use any other substances. Just my medicine for my blood pressure. I try to take care of myself. It’s important, especially getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d also like to do a gentle abdominal exam and check your prostate. That will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand you need to check things. The prostate… is that… uncomfortable? I’ve heard things. But if you need to, go ahead. I want to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Dondre. It might be a little bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs are clear as well. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm going to need you to bend over on the exam table for a brief digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know if anything feels wrong. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. It's been a long time since I’ve had a doctor check things like this. Go ahead when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just checking now… Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of concern. It’s not particularly tender to the touch. Alright, that’s all done. It wasn’t too bad, I hope?
PATIENT: It wasn't… awful. A little uncomfortable, like you said, but I’ve had worse. So, what does that mean? Is it bad that it’s enlarged? Is that why I can’t empty my bladder all the way?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad it wasn’t too bad. An enlarged prostate is a common finding in men your age, Dondre. It’s called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. It means your prostate is getting larger, which can sometimes press on your urethra—the tube that carries urine out of your bladder—making it harder to empty your bladder completely. It’s not cancer, and it's often manageable. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection and a PSA blood test to further evaluate your prostate. We should also do a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That… sounds good. A urine test and a blood test… and something to see how much is left in there. That makes sense. I’m glad it’s not cancer, like you said. So, what happens after you get the results? Will I need medicine? Or… something else? I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me what you think is best.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the test results, options could include lifestyle changes, medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, or in some cases, a minor procedure. Let’s start with the tests. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw some blood and collect a urine sample. We usually have results back within a few days. In the meantime, try to avoid drinking large amounts of fluids before bed. And if you're able, try to urinate a little more completely each time you go to the bathroom—but don’t strain. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. No big drinks before bed, and try to empty my bladder better. I can do that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better knowing what’s going on, and what we can do about it. I’ll wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Nurse, could you please come in and get a urine sample and some blood from Dondre Hilber?
PATIENT: Okay. I’ll just sit here and wait. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I feel much better knowing there's a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad you’re feeling more reassured. .
