DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. Well, it’s…it’s been my stomach, mostly. A lot of pain, down low. It comes and goes, you see, but when it does come…it’s quite something. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can’t really pinpoint exactly when it started, but it’s been troubling me for a bit now. The doctor…a previous doctor, mentioned something about…SLE? Is that right? It all feels a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: SLE… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Yes, I see a note here from Dr. Aris back in…2018. Hmm. Well, that’s good information. It's not uncommon for symptoms to wax and wane with Lupus. But we shouldn't assume that's what this is. Let's focus on right now. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, yes. Lupus…that rings a bell, faintly. Dr. Aris…a lovely man. The pain…it’s…difficult to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like a…a deep ache? A cramping, sometimes. It feels like…everything is being squeezed. And it comes in waves, you see. Sometimes it’s mild, just a discomfort, and other times…well, other times it makes it hard to even stand up straight. It’s mostly on the lower part of my stomach, but it seems to spread to my back a little, too. I really wish I could be more precise, but…it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long do these episodes usually last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's…difficult to say. Some last just a few hours, maybe. Others…others seem to go on for a whole day, or even a bit longer. It’s very unpredictable, I’m afraid. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern to it. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been…well, after I’ve been moving around a lot, but not always. And sometimes it just comes on for no reason at all. It’s quite unsettling, to be honest. I find myself just…waiting for it to happen, which is no way to live, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, lasting hours to a full day…and sometimes triggered by activity, sometimes not. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see…lying down usually helps. If I can just rest flat, it seems to take some of the pressure off. And…warm baths. A nice warm bath can soothe it a little. But those are just temporary fixes, really. Nothing seems to make it go away completely. And, truthfully, I've been trying a lot of different things over the years…various teas, and…well, I can’t even remember all of them now. My niece suggested something recently, but it didn't seem to do much. It’s all rather discouraging, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think... I take a small blood pressure medication, Lisinopril, every morning. And…ah, yes, something for my cholesterol, too. Atorvastatin, I believe it's called. And occasionally, when my joints are particularly bothersome, I’ll take some Ibuprofen. But that’s only when needed, you see. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don’t think all those things are good for you, long-term. Is that enough information? I’m afraid I’m not very organized when it comes to these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, and Ibuprofen as needed. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…a very good question. Hmm… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. But…there was that one time, many years ago, when I had a rash after taking some sort of antibiotic. But I don’t remember the name of it, or even what it was for. It was a long time ago, and I don’t think it was a serious reaction. Just a little itchy. Honestly, my memory is such a mess these days. It’s probably best to err on the side of caution, though. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll make a note of that. Now, just to get a more complete picture, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides high blood pressure and high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a rather broad question. Well, as you mentioned, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And…Dr. Aris, he diagnosed me with Lupus, as we discussed earlier. But it’s been quite some time since that diagnosis, and I haven’t seen him in years. I also had a gallbladder removed, many years ago. And…oh, yes, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. I believe that’s all. Or…at least, all that I can remember at the moment. My niece sometimes reminds me of things, but she’s not always accurate, you see. It’s all rather confusing. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll take our time. Now, family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s another tricky one. My mother…she had arthritis, I believe. And my father…he had heart trouble, later in life. And…my sister, she had diabetes, but she passed away several years ago. As for other relatives… I’m afraid I don’t know much about their medical histories. We weren’t a very close family, you see. Everyone kept to themselves. And honestly, I wasn’t very interested in those sorts of things when I was younger. I just assumed everyone got sick eventually. I wish I could be more helpful, but that’s all I can recall at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never. Smoking? Heavens, no. My mother smoked, and it was a dreadful habit. I always vowed I’d never touch a cigarette. And alcohol…I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’ve never been interested in any of that. I’m a very simple woman, you see. I prefer a quiet life. I enjoy gardening, and reading, and spending time with my niece. That’s all. I hope that’s satisfactory.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear. Okay, Ms. Glymph, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and get a general sense of how you're doing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement completely, dear. Please, proceed. I’m quite used to doctor’s visits, you see. Though, admittedly, I don’t always remember the details afterwards. But I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, wonderful. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. I'll be pressing gently to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels painful. …There's some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright. And finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Okay, Ms. Glymph. That concludes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have some abdominal discomfort, possibly related to the lower abdomen. The tenderness I felt is something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn’t sound terribly…reassuring, does it? Investigate further? What does that entail, dear? More tests? I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of tests. They always seem to take so long, and I never quite understand the results. But…if it’s necessary, I suppose I can manage. I just…I wish I knew what was going on. This pain is so unsettling, and it’s been going on for so long. I just want to feel like myself again. What are your thoughts, dear?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious when you don't know what's causing your pain. And you're right, tests can be a bit of a hassle. But they're the best way to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Based on your symptoms and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something related to your Lupus, a flare-up, perhaps. But it could also be something else entirely. I’d like to order a couple of tests. First, a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation or infection. And a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a more detailed look at your organs. The CT scan will require you to drink a contrast dye, so we’ll need to check your kidney function first to make sure it’s safe for you. We can do that with a blood test as well. These tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… quite a lot of tests. A CT scan? And contrast dye? It all sounds rather…intimidating, dear. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… But I do worry about side effects. And, truthfully, I’m not very good at remembering all the instructions. I always seem to forget something. But…if it will help me get to the bottom of this pain, I suppose I can try. Just…please be patient with me. And perhaps you could give me written instructions? And explain everything very clearly? I just want to feel better, dear. That’s all. And I trust your judgement completely. Let’s proceed with the tests, if you think it’s best. Just…please take good care of me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Glymph. I will take excellent care of you. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I’ll make sure you understand everything before we proceed. And yes, I'll provide written instructions with very clear explanations. First, we'll draw some blood for the CBC, urinalysis, and kidney function tests. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will explain the process to you. Once we have the results back – usually within a day or two – we'll schedule the CT scan. The radiology technician will explain the contrast dye and what to expect during the scan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…much better. Explanations, written instructions…that’s very reassuring. Hmm…let me see. The contrast dye…will it make me feel sick? And the CT scan…is it painful? And how long will it take? I just…I worry about being confined in a small space. I’ve never been very good with enclosed spaces. And…what if the tests show something…serious? I try not to think about those things, but it’s hard not to worry, isn’t it? Perhaps I’m asking too many questions. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. These are all very valid concerns. Let's address them one by one. The contrast dye can sometimes cause a mild warmth or flushing sensation, but serious side effects are rare. We'll monitor you closely during the scan. The CT scan itself is not painful. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s a bit noisy, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes. As for being confined in a small space, that’s understandable. The machine is relatively open, and you can close your eyes or listen to music during the scan to help you relax. If you feel claustrophobic, you can let the technician know, and they’ll stop the scan immediately. Regarding what the tests might show…it’s best not to jump to conclusions. We need to get the results first. And even if we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious. Many conditions are treatable, and we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I’ll write up the orders and send you down to the lab. The nurse will be happy to answer any further questions you have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that…that’s much better. Knowing I can stop the scan if I feel claustrophobic is very reassuring. And the thought of having options is…comforting. Yes, let’s proceed with the tests. Write up the orders, and I’ll go to the lab. Perhaps a little bit of distraction will help me take my mind off things. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate your kindness. I feel a little bit better now, knowing I have a plan. I suppose I should go and get these tests done. Wish me luck! And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. You've got this! And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I'll be here.
