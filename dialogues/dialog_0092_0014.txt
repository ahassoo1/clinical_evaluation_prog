DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… let me see. My wife, she handles most of this sort of thing, you see. Something about papers… for work? I think I need something signed so I can, uh… take some time. It's a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about needing to be off for a bit. I work with the church, doing… things. Educational things, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you may need a medical note for leave from work. We can certainly address that. To help me write that note accurately, could you tell me a little more about why you're needing time off?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Why… Well, it's… my back. Been acting up lately. Not a sudden thing, more of a slow build, you know? Makes it hard to… stand for long periods. And lifting things… forget about it. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s been harder the last few weeks, which is why I’m finally getting around to seeing someone about it. Does that make sense? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. So, it's a gradual onset of back pain, worsening over the past few weeks, making it difficult to stand and lift. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… lower back, mostly. Right across here . Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not always. Mostly just a dull ache, but when I move wrong… or try to lift something… then it's a sharp pain. It's not constant, thank goodness, but it's definitely there most of the time now. I mostly just try to ignore it, to be honest. It doesn't help, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, with occasional radiating pain down the leg, and a sharp increase in pain with movement or lifting. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Sitting, mostly. Or lying down. Definitely lying down. And… warm baths. My wife makes sure I take warm baths. That helps a little, eases it up for a while. But it always comes back, you know? Doesn’t last long, though. Just a temporary relief, mostly. Walking… sometimes helps, sometimes makes it worse. It’s… unpredictable, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sitting, lying down, and warm baths provide some relief, but the pain returns. Walking is inconsistent. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no weakness or anything like that. And no tingling, not that I've noticed. Just the ache. And the sharp pain when I… well, when I try to do too much. My wife keeps telling me to slow down, but you know how it is. There’s always something that needs doing. But no, nothing like tingling or numbness. Just pain. Mostly. It's just getting… harder to ignore, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just pain. And it’s progressively becoming more difficult to ignore. Now, have you had any injuries to your back in the past, or have you had back pain like this before?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not that I remember, no. Nothing serious, anyway. Maybe a tweak here or there when I was younger, playing sports… but nothing that needed a doctor. As for the pain… I’ve had aches and pains off and on for years, you know, just getting older. But this… this is different. It's more constant, and more… intense. It hasn’t gone away on its own like it usually does. That's why I’m here, I suppose. This isn't just a little tweak. It's something more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant prior back injuries, and this pain is different and more persistent than previous aches. Now, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… well, I’m 67, so things are starting to creak a bit, you know? I try to eat well, mostly fish and fruit, that sort of thing. My wife is very good about that. I don’t smoke, haven’t for years. I used to enjoy a little drink now and then, but I don't much anymore. I try to stay active, doing a bit of gardening, walking when the back allows. I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. Otherwise… I guess I’m okay for my age. Nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains. And now this back thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and you otherwise maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking something. My wife handles all that. I just take the pills she gives me. It’s a little white one, I think? Or maybe it’s a little blue one… I really couldn’t tell you the name. She keeps a list, of course, but I haven’t looked at it in ages. I can ask her when I get home, if that helps? I really don’t pay attention to those things, I’m afraid. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to apologize. We can likely access that information through your medical records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always checks, before she gives me anything. She’s very careful about that. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Nothing serious. No allergies, though. She’d never let me take something if I was allergic. She's a very cautious woman, my wife. Very, very cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think might be relevant to your back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, the church… we’ve been doing a lot of work on the grounds lately. Lifting stones, moving things around… building a little garden area. It’s been good work, but it’s been hard on my back, I think. Maybe that’s what started it? I don’t know. I just know it’s been getting worse the last few weeks, and now it’s getting… difficult. That's about it, I think. Nothing else comes to mind. I’m not usually one for complaining, you know? But this is… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recent increased physical activity with church grounds work may be a contributing factor. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your back to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what's going on. It's just… annoying, you know? And getting harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie on your stomach on the examination table. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m going to palpate your back now. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Alright, I'm noting some tenderness to palpation at L4-L5. And I'm assessing your range of motion now... ...Limited range of motion, especially with flexion. And finally, I’ll perform a straight leg raise test… …Positive straight leg raise on the right side at approximately 30 degrees, reproducing your pain down the leg. Based on this preliminary exam, it appears we’re dealing with possible lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to nerve compression. This could be caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, we will need to get some imaging to confirm this. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s it. Right there. That’s where it hurts. And bending… yes, that’s difficult. It feels stiff. And… the leg thing… yes, that’s what I’ve been feeling. Not constant, but when I move wrong… or try to bend over… that’s when it shoots down my leg. Lumbar… what now? Radiculo… oh dear. You lost me a bit, Doctor. Herniated… stenosis? Sounds… serious. Imaging? You mean like… pictures? Is it bad? I just want to be able to get back to doing things, you know? This is all a bit overwhelming. I just thought it was a bad back.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds more complicated than a simple bad back, but let’s not jump to conclusions. “Lumbar radiculopathy” simply means that a nerve in your lower back is being irritated or compressed, causing the pain you’re feeling down your leg. “Herniated disc” refers to a problem with the cushions between your vertebrae. “Spinal stenosis” means a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord. Both can cause nerve compression. "Imaging" means we would get an X-ray or, more likely, an MRI of your lower back to visualize the structures and see what’s causing the compression. It's not necessarily serious, but it's important to know what we're dealing with so we can develop the right treatment plan. To start, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. We can also try some conservative treatments like physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… an MRI… and no lifting, bending, twisting. That’s going to be difficult. But I understand, Doctor. It’s better to know what we’re dealing with, I suppose. And medication… yes, that sounds good. Anything to ease the pain. Physical therapy… I’ve heard of that. Will that help strengthen my back? So, just to be clear… you don’t think it’s something really bad? I mean, I've heard stories… about people needing surgery and… I just want to be able to get back to normal, you know? Gardening… helping out at the church… that's important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good that you're asking these questions. At this stage, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your pain without the MRI results. However, most cases of lumbar radiculopathy can be managed with conservative treatment – physical therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. Surgery is rarely the first line of treatment and is usually reserved for cases that don’t respond to conservative measures. We will cross that bridge if and when it becomes necessary. For now, let's focus on getting that MRI scheduled and starting you on a course of physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. I'm going to prescribe you Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain and inflammation. I’ll also write you a referral to a physical therapist specializing in back pain. I want to emphasize that we will monitor your progress closely. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few weeks, we can re-evaluate and consider other options. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Naproxen… I’ll remember that. And the physical therapist… I'll make an appointment as soon as I can. So, just to be clear, no heavy lifting, bending, twisting, take the Naproxen, and see the physical therapist. And we’ll see how it goes? And… the MRI, you’ll let me know when the results are back? I trust your judgement, Doctor. You seem to know what you're doing. I just want to get back to my normal life, you know? Gardening… church… it's all I want. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Limtiaco. You’ve summarized it perfectly. No heavy lifting, bending, or twisting, take the Naproxen as prescribed, and start physical therapy. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your progress and discuss the MRI results. I’ll have the nurse give you a printed summary of these instructions, along with the prescriptions and referral information. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your patience. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll get the nurse and follow those instructions. And I’ll call if anything comes up. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad I could help. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day to you as well. .
