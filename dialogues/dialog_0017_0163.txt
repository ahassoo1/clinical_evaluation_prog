DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be perfectly frank, it’s a bit of a foolish matter, I suspect. But my daughter insisted. I’ve been… experimenting with diets, shall we say. Rather extreme ones, lately. She’s worried, and truthfully, I’m starting to feel a bit daft about the whole business.
DOCTOR: "Foolish matter," you say. Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, dismissing a concern as 'foolish' is rarely productive. Extreme diets can have serious consequences, even at your age. Let's begin with the specifics. When did you start these… experiments?
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. You're absolutely correct, of course. It is rather irresponsible of me. Let me see… the most recent one, the one that prompted my daughter’s intervention, began approximately three weeks ago. Before that… oh, goodness, there was the cabbage soup one, about six months back. And before that… well, it’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I dabble. Mostly inspired by articles I read online. Not terribly sensible, in retrospect.
DOCTOR: Online articles, of course. Mr. Vantine, I must strongly advise against self-treating based on internet advice. It’s rarely tailored to an individual’s needs, and frankly, much of it is… unsubstantiated. Three weeks ago, you say. And what specifically does this current diet entail?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well. It's…rather restrictive, Doctor. It’s based around a single fruit – the pomelo, you see. Only pomelo, and water. Absolutely no other food. The articles claimed it detoxifies the system and promotes… rapid weight loss. I’ve lost a considerable amount, actually, which is what initially encouraged me. But I’m starting to feel rather weak and, if I’m truthful, quite irritable. My daughter says I’m rambling, which, considering my profession, is a rather astute observation, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, a diet consisting solely of pomelo and water for three weeks is… profoundly unwise. It's dangerously lacking in essential nutrients. We need to assess the damage. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, now that you mention it. There has been a certain… lightness of head on occasion. And, ahem, let’s just say my usual regularity has been… disrupted. Rather dramatically. As for nausea, not precisely, but a persistent feeling of emptiness, a sort of hollow ache, if that makes sense. And my hands… they’ve been trembling a bit, especially when I’m attempting to sketch. Which, as you can imagine, is rather concerning for someone in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, this is precisely what I was concerned about. We need to check your vital signs and perform a brief physical assessment. I’ll need you to step onto the scale, please. And afterwards, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Do you have any history of heart problems or diabetes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I have no history of heart problems, no. My father had a touch of high blood pressure, but nothing more. As for diabetes… no, never. I’ve always been rather active, despite my age, and I maintain a… reasonably healthy lifestyle, between these ill-advised dietary experiments, of course. Though, admittedly, my definition of ‘healthy’ has become rather… fluid recently.
DOCTOR: 148 pounds. And your height is recorded as 187 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s correct. 187 centimeters. Though, I suspect I’ve lost a bit of height with the… shall we say, shrinkage, from the lack of proper nourishment. It’s a rather undignified thought, frankly. A special effects artist shrinking in stature! Perhaps I should have used forced perspective.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, while I appreciate your… colorful descriptions, we need to remain focused. Your weight is within a normal range, but that doesn't negate the potential damage you've inflicted with this diet. Now, please have a seat on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Absolutely right. My apologies for the digression. Proceed as you see fit. I shall endeavor to remain… grounded in reality. Though, after three weeks of pomelo, I fear that may be a challenge.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute, but rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Extended, as requested. Though, if my reflexes are diminished, I shall not be surprised. I suspect my entire system is rather… depleted. It’s a bit like a puppet with cut strings, if I’m being honest. Rather dramatic, I know, but it accurately reflects my current state.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are indeed diminished, particularly in the lower extremities. Muscle tone is also slightly reduced. Mr. Vantine, your symptoms—weakness, irritability, dizziness, diminished reflexes—are consistent with malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance. This diet has been dangerously restrictive. We need to run some blood tests to assess the extent of the damage and rule out any other underlying conditions. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and electrolyte levels. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, thank heavens. No reactions to any medication I've ever encountered. And I’ve never had any… interventions requiring contrast dye, so that’s not a concern. A complete blood count and metabolic panel… sounds thorough. I confess, I rather dread the thought of needles, but I understand it’s necessary. It seems my foray into extreme dieting has rather… unraveled. Is there anything I should do immediately, aside from the blood tests? Should I…attempt to reintroduce solid food, perhaps? Or is complete abstinence the wiser course?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. No, do not attempt to abruptly reintroduce a full diet. That could cause further complications. We need to reintroduce food gradually. Start with small, easily digestible portions of bland foods – things like crackers, toast, or broth. And absolutely no more pomelo. Focus on hydration. Sip water throughout the day. I will also write you a prescription for a multivitamin and electrolyte supplement to help replenish your stores. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review your blood test results and discuss a more comprehensive dietary plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe dizziness, weakness, or chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly, Doctor. No pomelo. Gradual reintroduction of bland foods. Hydration. Multivitamin and electrolyte supplement. Follow-up appointment next week. And emergency room if symptoms worsen. I believe I have that all correct. It seems my daughter was quite correct to be concerned. I shall endeavor to heed her advice – and yours – in the future. Perhaps a nice cup of tea and a biscuit is a more sensible approach to nutrition. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and… forbearance.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad you’re taking this seriously. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and provide you with the prescriptions. And please, Mr. Vantine, consider this a lesson learned. The pursuit of health should not come at the expense of being healthy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: .
