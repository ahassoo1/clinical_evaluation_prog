DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Pipkorn. Real nice to meet you. Well, it's just a check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? It’s just a routine immunization visit, like the nurse said when she scheduled it.
DOCTOR: I see. A routine immunization visit. While I appreciate you maintaining your preventative care, Ms. Fornes, it’s always prudent to understand the full clinical picture. Are you experiencing any current symptoms – anything at all out of the ordinary?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything’s been pretty good, actually. No aches, no pains, no nothin'. Just…normal for an old lady, I guess! I mean, I get a little tired after work, but that’s just from bein’ on my feet all day, inspectin’ buildings. It’s a physical job, you know?
DOCTOR: "Old lady," you say. At 53, Ms. Fornes, you are certainly not…that old. However, I understand your point. Fatigue can be indicative of numerous underlying factors, even with a physically demanding profession. To clarify, this fatigue – is it constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not constant constant. It comes and goes. Some days I feel like I could build a house myself, and others...others I just wanna sit and watch TV. It seems worse at the end of the week, naturally. You know, after a long week of workin’ out in the sun and climbin’ ladders. It's probably just bein' tired, honestly. I don't make a fuss over it.
DOCTOR: “Naturally,” you say. While I respect your self-assessment, Ms. Fornes, it's my professional responsibility to investigate any reported changes in your well-being. Beyond the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, now that you mention it, I have been a little more thirsty lately. I thought it was just 'cause of the heat, though. August in the city…whew! And, shoot, maybe I’ve been a little more irritable than usual. My husband says I'm grumpier, but he always says that! Honestly, I think he just likes to tease me.
DOCTOR: “Teasing,” of course. Increased thirst and irritability, however, can be relevant observations. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… pretty much the same. I still eat like a horse, if I'm bein' honest. And weight… I think maybe I've lost a little. Not much, though. Hard to say for sure. I don’t really weigh myself every day, or even every week. My clothes still fit, so… It’s probably just the heat makin’ me sweat more. Everything’s looser in the summer, ya know?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your casual assessment, Ms. Fornes, attributing everything to the heat is…simplistic. We need to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits – frequency, urgency, or color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're askin' about… Well, I guess I have been goin’ to the bathroom a little more often, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just 'cause I'm drinkin' more water! And the color… seems normal enough. You know, yellow. I'm not one for lookin’ at my…well, you know. I just go, and I don't think much about it. It's probably nothin'.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, while I understand your reluctance to discuss personal matters, it is essential for a comprehensive evaluation. Increased urinary frequency, even if you attribute it to increased fluid intake, requires further investigation. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, kidney problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ major. When I was a kid, I had the usual things – chickenpox, measles… Oh, and my mom always said I had a weak bladder, but that was probably just her bein' dramatic. As an adult… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a little while a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. The doctor said I was fine after that. Other than that… nothin’. I’m pretty healthy, for my age. I work hard, and I eat good food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly,” you say. Dietary habits are important, Ms. Fornes. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think. Usually for breakfast, I have toast and coffee. Sometimes eggs, if I'm feelin’ ambitious. Lunch is usually a sandwich – turkey or ham – with some chips. And dinner… well, my husband does most of the cookin’. He likes to make fish, a lot of salmon. Sometimes steak, or chicken. We eat a lot of vegetables, too – peas, carrots, beans… He’s a good cook, really. We don't eat a lot of junk food, honestly. Maybe a little ice cream now and then. It's pretty healthy, all in all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your past surgical history – have you ever undergone any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Not even tonsils out! I’m a tough old bird. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid the hospital, knock on wood. Just the usual doctor visits, you know? Check-ups and shots. That’s it. I'm a pretty simple lady, really. Don’t need a lot of fussin' over.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… well, my mom lived to be 85, and she was pretty healthy right up 'til the end. My dad… he had some heart trouble when he was older. And my brother… he had diabetes. But that's about it, really. Not a lot of serious illnesses in my family. Mostly just the usual things – colds, flu, aches and pains. You know, the normal stuff. Not much to worry about, really.
DOCTOR: And your social history, Ms. Fornes?
PATIENT: Oh, you mean…do I drink and smoke? Heavens, no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life, and I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once a month. I like to keep things clean and healthy. I work hard, and I don't need anything to slow me down. I don't really go out much, either. My husband and I mostly stay home and watch TV, or go for walks in the park. It's a quiet life, but it's a good life.
DOCTOR: Finally, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s nothing serious, just something to help with the pain. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. It's called… uh… I can’t quite recall the name right now, but it’s a little white pill. I take it every day. Other than that… nothing. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies whenever I can.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fornes. Now, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.
PATIENT: Alrighty then. Sounds good, Dr. Pipkorn. Just let me know if you need anything. I’m a little creaky, so be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Joints in both hands exhibit mild tenderness and crepitus, consistent with reported arthritis. No acute inflammation observed.
PATIENT: Okay. Does all that mean somethin' bad, Dr. Pipkorn? My arthritis has been actin' up a little lately, but I thought it was just the weather. I really just came in for my shots, you know? I don’t like makin’ a fuss.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, while your arthritis appears consistent with your report, the elevated blood pressure and reported increased urinary frequency are concerning. Given your age and family history of diabetes, a more thorough investigation is warranted. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and an EKG to assess your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. Are you sayin' somethin's really wrong with me, Dr. Pipkorn? I just thought I was gettin’ old. I don’t really like hospitals… or tests. Is there any way we can just… skip it? I feel fine, mostly. I just came in for my shots, remember?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I understand your reluctance, but as your physician, it is my responsibility to ensure your well-being. These tests are necessary to rule out any potentially serious underlying conditions. Ignoring these symptoms could have significant consequences. I will also need to document your lack of insurance, and we may need to explore options for financial assistance to cover the cost of these tests. We can discuss that with the billing department after this consultation. Now, do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: …Alright, then. Okay, I guess I consent to the tests. But… could you explain what they’re for, just so I know what to expect? And… could you try to make it quick? I really don’t like bein’ in hospitals.
DOCTOR: Very well. The complete blood count will assess your overall blood health, including red and white blood cell counts. The comprehensive metabolic panel will evaluate your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and electrolyte balance. The urinalysis will check for any abnormalities in your urine, such as infection or protein. The EKG will measure your heart’s electrical activity and identify any irregular rhythms. The blood draw and urine sample can be collected here in the clinic. The EKG will require you to lie still for a few minutes while we attach electrodes to your chest. It is a painless procedure. Once the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the appropriate course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a fish fry next weekend that I promised my husband I'd go to… I don’t wanna miss it. And… will I need a ride? I usually have my husband drive me, but he’s out of town visitin’ his sister.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will involve a brief, sharp pinch. It is typically well-tolerated. The discomfort is minimal and subsides quickly. As for the results, it typically takes 3-5 business days for the lab to process them. I will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Regarding transportation, you will need to arrange for a ride to and from the lab. I can provide you with a list of local transportation services if needed. However, that is your responsibility. Now, before we proceed, let’s discuss your current medications again. You mentioned a little white pill for arthritis. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. I think it was… one pill, twice a day? Or maybe it was just one a day. I can't quite remember. The bottle's at home. It's a little white pill… that's all I know for sure. I've been taking it for a long time, so I guess it's okay. Is it really that important?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, knowing the precise dosage of any medication you are taking is crucially important. It allows me to assess potential drug interactions and ensure your safety. I strongly advise you to retrieve the medication bottle and bring it to your follow-up appointment. Until then, I will proceed with caution. Now, let’s finish this examination. Please sit up, and I will prepare the requisition for the blood draw and urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay… alright. I’ll try to remember to bring the bottle next time. I guess I’ll just go home and try to relax, then. I hope everything’s okay.
DOCTOR: The lab is located at 123 Main Street. Please bring a valid form of identification and your insurance card, if you have one. You do not need to fast for these tests. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Until then, if you experience any unusual symptoms—fever, shortness of breath, chest pain—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Pipkorn. I'll try to remember everything you said. I appreciate you takin’ the time to see me. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Fornes.
