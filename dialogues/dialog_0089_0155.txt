DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been gettin’ worse lately. Not sure why, really. Old age, probably. Don't remember exactly when it started, just… gradually. It makes things difficult, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening shaking, primarily in the hands. And you feel it’s likely due to age?
PATIENT: Could be. I mean, what else? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Worked hard my whole life at the water plant... or was it the wastewater plant? Both, I suppose. Lots of pipes and dials. Don’t recall anything specific causing it, though. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, both plants, good to know. And it's interfering with daily activities now, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Makes holding a cup… difficult. And small things, like buttoning my shirt. Used to be no problem. Now… well, now it takes a while. I drop things more often too. It's just… inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this shaking been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't at my age? My legs feel a bit… stiff, now that you mention it, but I’ve always been a bit clumsy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get to the bottom of things. Let’s go through a quick review of your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That's a tough one. I saw doctors now and then, for the usual things – colds, the flu… I had something with my stomach once, a long time ago, but I can't recall what it was. Nothing serious, I don’t think. No, I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my appendix out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder while working. But that was… years and years ago. No major hospital stays that I remember. Just the usual things, a night or two for the appendix and the arm. Nothing recent, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix and a broken arm in the past. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your relatives have a history of shaking or similar neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… That's a bit beyond me, Doctor. My father… he was a strong man, worked in the fields. I think he got a bit forgetful towards the end, but that could just be old age. My mother… she lived a good long life too. I don't recall anyone having the shakes, no. Lots of aches and pains, like you'd expect. But not the shakes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of shaking specifically. And just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. Nothing regular, really. I take a bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my knees, when they’re acting up. And I used to take something for my stomach, but I stopped a long time ago. I don’t recall the name of it. Nothing else. Just the ibuprofen, now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed. Last question for the history, do you use tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched recreational drugs. I used to enjoy a beer with dinner, back when I was younger, but I haven’t had one in… well, a long time. Maybe twenty years? I stopped when my wife… well, it just didn’t seem right after that. No, I don't use any of that stuff now.
DOCTOR: Okay. No tobacco, alcohol only occasionally in the past. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Mr. Jezik. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what might be going on?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I suppose you need to poke and prod a bit. It’s alright with me. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. Not that I can remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'd like to examine your neurological function – check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. And I’ll take a look at your hands and see how the shaking presents. Okay, your vitals are a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you with your palms up?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go. Palms up... like this? It's shaking a bit already, you see. Always is worse when I hold them out like this. Don't know why.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. It appears to be a resting tremor, more prominent when your arms are extended. Now, could you tap your finger to your nose, and then touch my finger, repeating that several times?
PATIENT: Here... It’s harder than it looks, Doctor. Used to be able to do this with my eyes closed. Not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's try something else. Could you please sit back and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Alright… They sometimes feel a bit stiff, you know. Not painful, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Here… Careful now. Don't want to fall. It’s not as easy as it used to be, Doctor. Balance isn’t what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Jezik. You can sit back down now. Okay, based on the exam, you have a resting tremor, some mild rigidity, slowness of movement, and a slightly unsteady gait. Your reflexes are normal. It's important to consider a few possibilities, and I'd like to discuss them with you. One possibility is Parkinson’s disease, but we need to rule out other causes as well. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… That sounds… serious. Is that what this is? I just thought I was getting old. I don't know… I guess if you say we need to rule things out, then we should. But I just want to know what’s going on. And if there's anything I can do about it. This shaking… it's getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. Parkinson’s is a serious condition, but it’s also important to remember that not everyone with tremors has Parkinson’s. There are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, like essential tremor, medication side effects, or even vitamin deficiencies. To help determine the cause, I would like to order some blood work to check for any underlying medical issues or vitamin deficiencies. And I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in disorders of the nervous system – for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform additional tests, such as a DaTscan, which can help differentiate between Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A specialist… alright. That sounds sensible, I suppose. Blood work… okay. I don’t mind that. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then do it. A DaTscan… what does that involve? I don’t like the sound of scans. Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about scans, Mr. Jezik. A DaTscan is a type of imaging test that uses a small amount of radioactive material to create pictures of your brain. It’s not painful. You’ll lie on a table while a special camera scans your brain. The scan takes about 30 minutes, and it doesn’t involve any needles or injections beyond the standard blood draw. The scan helps us to see how much dopamine is being produced in your brain, which can help differentiate between Parkinson’s and essential tremor. While we await the results and your appointment with the neurologist, is there anything that makes the shaking worse, or anything that provides relief?
PATIENT: Hmm... That sounds… alright, I guess. No needles is good. Not sure about the radioactive material, but you seem to know what you're doing, Doctor. As for what makes it worse… stress, probably. And cold weather. Hands shake a lot more when it’s cold. Relief… nothing really. Resting sometimes helps, but not much. A warm cup of tea… might calm me down a bit, but that’s probably just the warmth. Nothing stops the shaking, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stress and cold worsen it; warmth and rest provide minimal relief. I'll order the blood work now and get a referral sent to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist at County General. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to manage your stress as best you can, and stay warm when possible. We'll follow up once we have the results of your blood work and Dr. Reed's evaluation. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address today?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, Doctor. Just… please hurry. This is unsettling, you know? Not knowing. And the shaking… it's just getting worse. But thank you. You've been very… patient with me. I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concern, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. I'll make a note of your forgetfulness in your chart, so we can be mindful of that during future appointments. Here are the blood work requisitions and the neurologist referral information. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Take care, Mr. Jezik, and we'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
