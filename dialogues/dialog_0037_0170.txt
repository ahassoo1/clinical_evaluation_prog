DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They sent me, said I need a check-up for the paperwork. I just want to get it done, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical. That's perfectly alright. We can definitely get that done for you. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. To start, let’s go over some general health information. Just to have a good baseline for the insurance company. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I get a little tired sometimes, work's kinda rough, long hours at the hotel. But nothing… serious, you know? No big problems. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly local food.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally feeling well. And I understand long hours can definitely take a toll. “Local food” is pretty broad, though. Could you tell me a little more about what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, typical… Okay. Breakfast is usually rice with maybe some fish if there's leftovers. Lunch, same kinda thing, or noodles. Dinner… depends. Sometimes rice again, sometimes taro, whatever’s easy. We eat a lot of bread too, that’s cheap. Not a lot of… greens, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Putney. That gives me a good picture. It sounds like you're getting a lot of carbohydrates and likely not a lot of fruits and vegetables. We can talk about ways to incorporate more of those later, if you’d like. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. The doctors back home… they didn’t tell me anything. I go when I need to, but it’s usually just a quick check-up, you know? Nothing serious ever came up. I had a bad cough last year, but it went away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it's not uncommon for things not to be thoroughly investigated during brief check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Nope. Not even for my tonsils when I was a kid. They just… went away on their own, I think. Or maybe my mom just didn’t take me to the doctor. I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any of them had any significant medical problems – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom, she had… problems with her feet, I think. Swelling, mostly. She didn’t go to the doctor much either. And my dad… he died young, heart attack, I think. But that was a long time ago, before I was really paying attention. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She lives on Majuro. We don't talk much anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Putney. A history of heart problems and foot issues in your family is good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take anything… well, I try not to take anything if I can help it. I don't like feeling sick from medicine. But no allergies, no. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I drink coffee, does that count? But that’s it. Just coffee to stay awake at work.
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count as medication, Mr. Putney. Alright, that completes our initial questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline for the insurance company. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got a lot of work waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Okay, deep breath… good. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Now, for your blood pressure… 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated. Pulse is 80 and regular. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Nose is also clear. Throat looks a bit red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little tender there, on the right side. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. I get heartburn sometimes, maybe that's it? It's nothing serious, I think. Just feels… full a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. Tenderness on the right side, and a feeling of fullness… okay. It could be related to heartburn, but given your blood pressure and family history, I want to investigate a bit further. I’m also going to check your reflexes and strength in your extremities. Reflexes are normal, and strength is good in all extremities. However, I’m noticing a slight swelling in your ankles. Have you noticed that yourself?
PATIENT: Yeah, now that you mention it… I have been a little swollen lately. I thought it was just from being on my feet all day at work. It gets worse at the end of the shift. I usually just put my feet up when I get home. But it doesn’t really go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Given your blood pressure, family history of heart problems, the tenderness in your abdomen, and the swelling in your ankles, I want to order a few lab tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to check your complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. We’ll also do an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, Doctor, I just need this paperwork done for the insurance. Is all this really necessary? I got a hotel to run, you know? Can’t I just… skip some of it? I feel fine, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney, and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, these tests aren’t just for the insurance company. They're for your health. Your blood pressure is elevated, and combined with your family history and the physical exam findings, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Skipping tests could mean missing something serious. For example, we need to check your kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. An EKG will help us identify any heart abnormalities. These are all important pieces of the puzzle. While you feel mostly fine, these tests can detect problems before they cause noticeable symptoms. Would you be open to proceeding with the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay, fine. Do the tests. But… can we hurry it up? And please, just tell me what I need to do. I don't want a long explanation, I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I’ll keep it concise. You’ll need to provide a urine sample – there’s a cup in the restroom, and instructions are posted on the wall. Then, the nurse will draw some blood. The EKG is quick – they’ll place some stickers on your chest and arms. The nurse will explain everything as she goes. It should take about 30-45 minutes total. After we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. I’ll also provide you with a copy of the results for your records. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… where’s the restroom? And tell the nurse I don’t have a lot of time.
DOCTOR: The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I'll let the nurse know you're short on time. She's very efficient. Once you've provided the sample, come back and let me know, and I'll have the nurse come get you for the blood draw and EKG. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Putney. We’ll get through this as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks.
