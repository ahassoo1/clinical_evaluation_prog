DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s Hartness. Look, I need this exam done. For the army. Gotta get it over with, really. Don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. We can absolutely get that taken care of for you. Just so I have a complete picture, is this a periodic exam required by the army, or is there a specific concern that prompted this request?
PATIENT: Concern? No, no concern. Just… gotta join up. They want this done before I can. Paperwork, I guess. Don’t see what the big deal is, honestly. Seems like a waste of time, but rules are rules.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's standard procedure for the army to require a comprehensive physical before enlistment. We want to ensure you're in optimal health and that there are no underlying conditions that need to be addressed. To proceed, I’ll need to gather some information from you. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma, for example?
PATIENT: Nah. Never had nothin’ like that. Strong as an ox, I am. Always been healthy. Worked on engines my whole life. Builds character, you know? Don't sit around like some... some office worker.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Hartness. Physical activity certainly has its benefits. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree. But that’s it. Mom put a splint on it. Good as new in a week. No doctors, no hospitals. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective. It's good to hear you've maintained good health without needing extensive medical intervention. Now, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Ha! You think I need medications? I eat right, work hard. No pills for me. Not even aspirin. Waste of money, again. Just… real food. And maybe a strong coffee in the morning. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, like latex or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I can eat anything, touch anything. Strong Swedish blood, you know? Built different. Never had a reaction to nothin’ in my life.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Family? Hmmm. My dad… he smoked too much. Lungs weren't great towards the end. Mom was fine, I think. Just… old age, mostly. Nothing major. No cancers, no… what was it? Diabetes? Nope. Pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Worked hard, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And finally, do you use tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I had a few beers with the lads now and then. But nothin’ crazy. Social stuff. And my dad smoked, remember? I don’t touch the stuff. Drugs? Absolutely not. What do you take me for? I'm joinin' the army, not…
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was a sensitive question, Mr. Hartness. It's standard procedure for a comprehensive medical evaluation. We need to have a complete picture of your health. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I'll need to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and then we'll do a general physical assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. I got things to do, you know. Don’t see what all the fuss is about, but if you have to poke and prod, then just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could please have a seat on the exam table, we’ll start with your vital signs. First, I’m going to measure your height and weight. Your height is 187 centimeters, and your weight is 53 kilograms. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 110/70 millimeters of mercury. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
PATIENT: Fine. Numbers are numbers, I guess. Not like I needed to be told how tall I am. So, what now? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Finally, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears, nose, and throat appear normal.
PATIENT: All that poking and prodding for nothin', probably. So, what’s the verdict? Am I fit enough to join up, or what? Don't tell me I gotta come back for more tests.
DOCTOR: Based on the physical examination, everything appears to be normal, Mr. Hartness. Your vital signs are within the normal range, your heart and lungs sound clear, your reflexes are normal, and your ears, nose, and throat are unremarkable. However, to complete the evaluation for your army enlistment, we will need to run a standard urine test and a blood test to screen for any underlying medical conditions. These tests will give us a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I told you I’m fine. Healthy as an ox. But… fine, whatever. If that’s what you need to tick your boxes… just get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It’s just a standard procedure for enlistment to ensure everything is completely thorough. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood and collect a urine sample. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we will review them and let you know if everything is clear. I'll write you a requisition form with the necessary instructions. Do you have any questions about the lab procedure or anything else?
PATIENT: 24-48 hours… great. More waiting around. Fine, just give me the paper. I can handle it. And no, I don’t have any questions. Just tell me where the lab is, and I’ll get it done. Hopefully, they don't poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. Room 203, down the hallway and to your left. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible. Once you've completed the tests, you can follow up with me in 48 hours, and we’ll discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you need a work/school note explaining your absence for these tests?
PATIENT: No. Don't need no note. I'm not missin' work for this. Alright, I'm goin'. Thanks… I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Have a good day, and we’ll see you in 48 hours. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic.
