DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some… unusual results from a gastrointestinal examination, and my general practitioner suggested I come in for a more thorough look. It concerned me enough to schedule an appointment, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unusual results are definitely worth investigating. Let's start with those results. Do you happen to have a copy with you, or did they send them directly to the clinic?
PATIENT: They sent them directly to the clinic, Doctor. I do not typically carry medical paperwork with me. My memory is quite good, however, so if you have questions about the specifics, I may be able to recall them. It was… something about an irregularity detected during the endoscopic procedure, if I recall correctly. It wasn’t a comfortable experience, so details are a little… hazy, but the result was what was flagged.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see it here. It does mention a polyp found during the colonoscopy. It was in the ascending colon, about 8 millimeters in size. And it was described as… tubular adenoma, low-grade dysplasia. Now, don’t let the medical terms worry you. A polyp is just an abnormal growth, and low-grade dysplasia means the cells are showing some changes, but it’s not currently considered a high risk. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, and what we should do next, could you tell me a little bit about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Thank you for clarifying, Doctor. It is reassuring to hear it's not considered high risk. I appreciate you explaining that. As for my bowel habits… well, they’ve been fairly consistent for many years. I typically have a bowel movement once a day, sometimes twice. No significant changes in frequency or consistency recently. No… blood, or pain, or anything of that nature. I do occasionally experience some… gas, but that is not unusual for me. I have always had a sensitive constitution, if you will. Is there anything specific you are looking for? Perhaps a change in color, or… texture?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the consistency and no blood or pain. "Sensitive constitution" is a helpful way to put it – it gives me a sense of your baseline. When you say no change in color, does that mean your stools are typically brown?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, typically brown. A normal, earth-tone brown, if that makes sense. No black, tarry stools, and no pale or… clay-colored stools. I do pay attention to such things, you see. My mother always insisted on observing one's own body closely. A good habit, I believe. Though it sometimes leads to unnecessary worry, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Paying attention to your body is a good habit. And it sounds like you’ve been doing just that. Now, have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other gastrointestinal procedures before this one?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, this was my first colonoscopy. I… avoided it for quite some time, frankly. It wasn’t a pleasant prospect. My general practitioner finally convinced me it was necessary, given my age and family history. My father had some… digestive issues later in life, though nothing specifically diagnosed. Just general discomfort and… irregularity. I suppose that is why he encouraged me to be vigilant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new finding, and your father had some vague digestive issues. That’s helpful to know. Let’s talk about your family history a bit more broadly. Besides your father’s digestive issues, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like colon cancer, polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, or any other cancers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother’s side of the family was generally quite healthy, if anything. No cancers that I am aware of. My father’s side… my paternal grandmother passed away at a relatively young age from heart disease, and one of his brothers had diabetes. No colon cancer, specifically, to my knowledge. Though, again, medical records were not kept as diligently in their generation. My aunt, his sister, had some stomach ulcers, but they were successfully treated. She lived to a good age. It’s… mostly general ailments, I’m afraid, nothing specific that would suggest a strong predisposition to gastrointestinal problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. No strong family history of colon cancer or polyps, but some general digestive issues on your father’s side and other health concerns. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked, nor have I used any tobacco products. My mother was vehemently opposed to it, and I inherited her… aversion, shall we say. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week, but that is the extent of my… indulgences. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as my age allows.
DOCTOR: Good to hear about the lack of tobacco use, and moderate alcohol consumption. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies. I have taken many medications over the years – various remedies for arthritis and the occasional cold – and never experienced an adverse reaction. I am quite fortunate in that regard. Though, I do sometimes experience a mild… discomfort with certain foods, particularly spicy dishes, but that is not an allergy, simply a sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a daily dose of glucosamine and chondroitin for my arthritis. About 1500 milligrams of each, if that is relevant. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for pain, perhaps once or twice a month, when my arthritis flares up. Otherwise, no other medications or supplements. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, glucosamine/chondroitin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and then I'll just do a quick digital rectal exam. It's standard procedure after finding a polyp, just to check for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand it is standard procedure. I… trust your professional judgment. Please proceed as you see fit. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. I must confess, I have never been particularly fond of such examinations. But I am willing to cooperate, of course.
DOCTOR: I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. Okay, let's start with listening to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, normal activity. No murmurs or bruits auscultated. Now, I'm going to ask you to lie on your side. The rectal exam was normal, no tenderness or masses detected. Stool was brown, no blood present. Okay, so everything appears normal on physical exam. Given your history, and the polyp found during the colonoscopy, the next step is to schedule a follow-up colonoscopy to remove the polyp and send it to pathology for a closer look. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear that the physical examination was normal. A follow-up colonoscopy, of course. I anticipated that would be the recommendation. Yes, I do have a question, Doctor. How long after the initial examination must one wait to have the polyp removed? And what, precisely, does “pathology” entail? I understand it involves examining the tissue, but I am not entirely clear on the process. And… what are the risks involved in the removal procedure? I would appreciate a thorough explanation, if you do not mind. I do try to be informed about such things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand wanting to be informed. Let's go through all of that. Typically, we recommend removing the polyp within 3-6 months of the initial colonoscopy. We want to get it done relatively soon, but it's also important to allow the colon to heal a bit. “Pathology” is exactly as you described – it's the examination of the polyp tissue under a microscope by a specialist doctor. They'll look for the specific type of polyp it is and, importantly, whether there are any cancerous cells present. As for the risks involved in the removal procedure, it's generally very safe. The most common risks are bleeding and perforation – a very small tear in the colon wall. The risk of bleeding is around 1-5%, and the risk of perforation is even lower, around 0.1-0.3%. We take precautions to minimize these risks, of course. We’ll have you sign a consent form explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure before it’s scheduled. Do you have any other questions about that, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: That is… a very thorough explanation, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining the potential risks so clearly. Bleeding and perforation, understood. And the pathology examination – I am relieved to hear it is a specialist who will be examining the tissue. No, I believe that answers my immediate questions. Perhaps… one final inquiry. Will the removal procedure require any… special preparation? Dietary restrictions, or any particular medications to avoid? I would like to be adequately prepared, naturally. And… will I be sedated during the procedure? I confess, I am somewhat anxious about the prospect of being… awake.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, good questions. Yes, there is some preparation involved. You'll need to do a bowel prep the day before the procedure to completely clear your colon. This typically involves drinking a special solution, which can be a bit unpleasant, but it's essential for a clear view during the procedure. We'll provide you with detailed instructions, and we can discuss options to make it more tolerable if you're concerned. As for sedation, yes, you will be sedated during the procedure. We typically use a moderate level of sedation, which means you'll be comfortable and relaxed, and you likely won’t remember much of it. A nurse will monitor your vital signs throughout the procedure. We’ll schedule a pre-procedure appointment with the endoscopy center to discuss all of this in detail, and to answer any further questions you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A pre-procedure appointment to discuss the bowel preparation and sedation – excellent. I feel much more reassured knowing that a nurse will be monitoring my vital signs. I believe that covers all of my concerns for the moment. Thank you for your patience and thorough explanations. You have been most helpful. I trust your expertise implicitly. Is there anything you require from me before we schedule the appointment? Any medical records I should obtain, or forms I should complete in advance?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. No, nothing further from you at this point. The endoscopy center will reach out to schedule the pre-procedure appointment and will provide you with all the necessary forms and instructions. They may ask for a list of your medications, which we've already discussed. I'll make a note to follow up with you after the procedure to discuss the pathology results. Do you have any work or school commitments we need to consider when scheduling the appointments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am retired, thankfully. My days are my own. No commitments to consider at all. I am… quite flexible. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much more confident about proceeding with the procedure now. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I shall await the call from the endoscopy center. And, of course, I look forward to hearing from you after the pathology results are available. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you, Denis. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll take good care of you. .
