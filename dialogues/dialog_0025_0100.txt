DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something about… checking for things. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. It was the paperwork, mostly. They said I needed it done. Medicare sent me, I believe. Something about making sure I’m… alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Checking for things” isn’t terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, not at all! You're right. It's… a drug test, I think? That's what a nice lady on the phone said. Something about my job, maybe? I operate… big machines, you know? Paving stuff. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I don't remember much about why they need the test, just that I do need it.
DOCTOR: So, this is a drug screening required by your employer?
PATIENT: Possibly? I think so. It’s… honestly, it could be. I work with the city, doing the roads. I suppose they want to be careful. I really don't recall signing anything specific about it, though. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy. I just go to work and drive the machines, you know? It's not something I usually think about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Let’s see what Medicare has on file here… Hmm. It does appear this is a mandated screening as part of a Department of Transportation safety program. They require regular drug testing for operators of heavy machinery. It’s standard procedure, really. Now, have you had any issues with substance use in the past?
PATIENT: Oh! That makes sense. The Department of Transportation… yes, that sounds right. Heavy machinery… Substance use… no, not really. I mean, I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing… serious. Not a problem, no. My husband… he liked a beer now and then, but he's gone now. It's been a few years. I mostly just focus on work, to be honest. I don't really do much else these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just… something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. My regular doctor prescribed it. I can’t remember the name right offhand, but it’s not much. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s an over-the-counter one, though. Ibuprofen, I think? Nothing fancy. That’s about it, I think. It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, the system confirms you’re prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension and you occasionally use ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I used to get a rash when I was a little girl from poison ivy, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t had any problems with anything recently. No, I don't believe I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Nothing that I know of, anyway. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it seems we’ve covered the basics. Now, let's proceed with the drug screening. It’s a standard urine test. I’ll need a sample. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine test… right. That makes sense. No, I don't think so. Just… is it a long process? I have to get back to work this afternoon, you see. I don’t want to hold things up. Is there anything special I need to do? Like, drink a lot of water or…? I just want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just a normal urine sample. Try to provide a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. It shouldn’t take long – just a few minutes to collect. The lab will handle the testing. As for holding things up, I understand. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. I'll have the results sent to your employer directly, as per their requirements. Do you know where the lab is located?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not too complicated then. Mid-stream… yes, alright. I think I remember that from… somewhere. And they send it to my employer directly? Okay, that’s fine. I don't think I know where the lab is, no. Is it clearly marked? I'm… not the best with directions, to be honest. I tend to get a bit turned around easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s clearly marked. Just follow the hallway to your left, and you’ll see a sign for “Lab Services”. It’s about halfway down on the right-hand side. It's hard to miss. And the technician there will guide you through the process. They do this all day, every day. No need to worry. Now, if you're finished with the test, I'll need to conduct a brief physical examination just to ensure everything else is in order. Standard protocol, really. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, good, halfway down on the right. I can manage that, I think. Thank you. A physical examination… yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Just… a quick look over? I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. It's just… things haven't been easy since my husband passed. But yes, alright. A quick look over is fine.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat on the exam table. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just a basic assessment. Then, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Nothing to worry about, standard procedure.
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure… yes. That sounds fine. I hope it's not too high. I get a little nervous at the doctor's office, you know? But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be gentle? My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just relax and try to breathe normally. This won’t take long. Now, I’m going to inflate the cuff. It will feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if it feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… It’s a little tight… but it’s alright. Just… a little tight. I don’t like things tight. But it’s okay. Just… almost done? I just don't like feeling constricted. It reminds me of… never mind. Just… almost done?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all done. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming. It's often higher in a clinical setting. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out.
PATIENT: 142/88… is that bad? I don’t really understand those numbers, to be honest. But okay. In… and out… in… and out… Is that alright? Am I doing it right? My lungs sometimes feel a little… tight, especially when it’s cold. But I don’t usually have any trouble breathing. It's just... something I've always lived with.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, I hear normal breath sounds. Your heart rate is regular. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Alright… clear lungs, good. That’s good to know. Ahhh… Is that alright? I don’t have any trouble seeing, and I don’t think I’ve ever had any ear infections. But go ahead, if you need to look. It’s just… a little uncomfortable, having someone stick things in my ears. But I trust you, Doctor. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Your ears are clear, no signs of infection or wax buildup. Your throat is slightly red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, just to check for any unusual sounds. Please lie flat on your back, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… clear ears, good. A slightly red throat… is that something to worry about? I haven’t had a sore throat in ages. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… please be careful. My tummy sometimes feels a little… sensitive. I have a bit of trouble with indigestion, you know? But I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just… let me know if you hear anything strange.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds. It’s normal to have some mild sensitivity, especially if you experience indigestion. Alright, that completes the physical examination. Overall, your vitals are within normal limits, and the examination didn’t reveal anything concerning. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss the next steps?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's good to hear. No unusual sounds… That’s a relief. Well… what are the next steps? You mentioned the drug test earlier… and I suppose I should ask… what are they looking for exactly? Is it just… recreational drugs? Or are they checking for anything else? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to make sure everything is alright with my job.
DOCTOR: The drug screening is a standard ten-panel test, which looks for common illicit substances, as well as prescription medications that could impair your ability to operate heavy machinery safely. It includes things like marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and PCP. It also checks for certain prescription painkillers and benzodiazepines. It's standard protocol for DOT employees, Ms. Hughston. The lab typically takes 24 to 48 hours to process the results, and they will be sent directly to your employer. They'll notify you if anything comes back positive. Do you have any specific concerns about a medication you're taking that might cause a false positive?
PATIENT: Oh, a ten-panel test… Marijuana, cocaine… those aren’t things I’ve ever touched. The only medication I take is Lisinopril for my blood pressure, and sometimes ibuprofen for my arthritis. I don’t think either of those would cause a problem, would they? I've been taking them for years, and I've never had any issues before. I just want to make sure I don't lose my job over something silly. It's all I have, you know?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is not known to cause a false positive on a standard ten-panel drug screen. Ibuprofen, in rare cases, can cause a slight interference with certain tests, but it’s unlikely to be significant. It’s highly improbable that either of those medications would cause a positive result, Ms. Hughston. I understand your concern, and I assure you, it’s very unlikely you’ll encounter any problems. However, if you do receive a notification from your employer about a positive result, please contact me immediately, and we can discuss further testing to confirm the findings. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds reasonable, yes. So, I just… go back to work now? And wait to hear from my employer? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… reassuring. It's just… it's been a stressful few years, and I worry about everything. But yes, I think I’m ready to go back to work now. Unless there’s anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, you're free to return to work. There’s nothing else you need to do at this time. Just remember, if you receive any notification about a positive drug screen result, please contact me immediately. Here’s a copy of the physical exam report for your records. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, and drive safely.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Drive safely. Bye bye!
