DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And…my family. There’s a history, you see. But honestly, it’s all a bit…fuzzy. I keep forgetting things these days. It’s the hearing that’s the worst, and sometimes the room just spins.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite unsettling to experience both hearing difficulties and dizziness, especially with a family history to consider. We'll certainly take a thorough look at everything. "Fuzzy" is a perfectly acceptable way to describe things – don't worry about being precise right now; we'll get there. Let’s start with your ears. When did you first notice the problems with your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's…difficult. It wasn't all at once, you see. It’s come and gone, really. Maybe…a few months ago? Or was it last year? It’s hard to say. I remember one time I was at the market, and everything just…muffled. Like someone turned the volume down. Then it was okay again for a while. It just…happens. And with the spinning…that’s less often, thankfully. But it’s scary when it does.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent hearing loss, starting several months ago, perhaps a year. And episodes of dizziness that are less frequent. That gives us a starting point. When you say “muffled,” does it affect one ear or both?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I think…it’s been both ears, at different times. Or maybe just one, sometimes? Oh dear, I’m so sorry, Doctor. It’s really hard to remember which. It’s not a constant thing, you see. That’s why it’s so confusing. It comes and goes like the tide.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's more important to get a general sense of what's happening. Intermittent issues in both ears is helpful to know. And it's not unusual for these things to be difficult to recall precisely. Now, regarding these episodes of dizziness – can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…a horrible feeling. Like everything is spinning, but I’m the one who’s moving, not the room. It makes me feel so sick, and I have to hold onto something. The world just…swirls. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s terrifying. And I get a bit sweaty, and sometimes my stomach feels upset. It’s worst when I stand up quickly, I think.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite distressing, Ms. Mayhugh. Vertigo – the sensation of spinning – accompanied by nausea, sweating, and sometimes triggered by standing quickly. That helps us narrow things down. Have you noticed anything before these episodes?
PATIENT: Before…let me think. Sometimes…a ringing in my ears? A sort of…high-pitched whine. Not always, but often. And…a feeling of fullness, like something is blocked. It’s hard to explain. Like trying to pop your ears on an airplane, but it never quite pops. And…Oh dear, I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Mayhugh. You’re providing very valuable information. Ringing in the ears – what we call tinnitus – and a feeling of fullness are both important to note. Now, let’s step back a bit. You mentioned a family history. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, my brother, bless his soul…he had problems with his balance, terrible problems. He had to use a walking stick for a while. And my mother…she had ringing in her ears, always complaining about it. The doctor said something about…the inner ear? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. It was a long time ago. They didn’t have the fancy tests you have now. And I think my aunt…she was always falling over. It might have been something similar, but…I just remember a lot of dizziness in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of balance issues, tinnitus, and falls. That’s certainly relevant. It sounds like there may be a genetic component to consider. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed years ago, and…I had a bit of a bad patch with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with medication. I don't take anything for it now, though. And… Oh dear, I’m forgetting everything! I used to be so good at remembering things. It’s just…the memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older, Ms. Mayhugh. And it’s not a cause for immediate concern. So, gallbladder removal and a history of elevated blood pressure that’s currently managed, or previously managed, is good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I used to take a lot of things for headaches, but nothing serious. Now…Oh dear, I’m starting to feel a bit flustered. This is all a bit much. Is it alright if we finish soon?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. We can absolutely take things at your pace. You’re doing very well. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, just these. I take a multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for my joints, but it’s just when they’re particularly sore. Not every day. And…That’s it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional joint supplement. Good. Now, Ms. Mayhugh, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright. I'll check your ears, eyes, and do some balance tests. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not a fan of tests, but…I suppose it’s best to find out what’s wrong. Just…be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your ears. Hmm…there’s a little bit of wax buildup, but nothing significant. The eardrum itself looks…slightly retracted. Similar on this side – some wax, and slight retraction of the eardrum. It’s not dramatic, but we’ll make a note of it. Now, could you please stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Oh dear…this isn’t easy. Oh, I can’t do it, Doctor. I’m going to fall!
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s perfectly understandable. That indicates some balance impairment. Now, could you stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and cross your arms across your chest?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I really don’t like this! I think I’m going to fall, Doctor! This is very unsettling!
DOCTOR: Easy now, Ms. Mayhugh. That's quite alright. It's important to be careful. It appears you do have some instability with your balance. Now, I'm just going to check your eye movements. I don’t see any obvious signs of nystagmus – that is, involuntary eye movements – but this doesn't rule everything out. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And your neck feels normal to palpation. Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Based on your symptoms and the brief examination, it seems we're dealing with a combination of hearing difficulties, balance problems, and episodes of dizziness. The wax buildup in your ears could be contributing to the hearing issues, and the balance tests indicate some instability. The dizziness is concerning, and we need to investigate that further. There are several possibilities, including inner ear problems like labyrinthitis or Meniere's disease, or potentially issues related to your blood pressure or neurological system. Given your family history, we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… complicated. Meniere’s disease? That doesn’t sound good. And my blood pressure? I thought that was under control. So what do we do now, Doctor? I just want to feel normal again. And I have that appointment this afternoon… I don't want to be dizzy then!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It does sound complicated, but we’ll take it one step at a time. Meniere’s disease is a possibility, but it's not a definitive diagnosis at this point. It's important not to jump to conclusions. And we'll certainly address the dizziness before your appointment this afternoon. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an audiogram – a hearing test – to assess the extent of your hearing loss. Then, a blood test to check your general health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And finally, I'd like to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological issues. In the meantime, I can recommend some over-the-counter medications to help with the dizziness, such as meclizine. And I advise you to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and excessive salt intake, as these can sometimes worsen dizziness. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests…more tests. Oh dear. But… I suppose it’s better to know what’s wrong, isn’t it? Yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. As long as it helps me feel better. And…yes, I can try those medications. Caffeine…I do enjoy my tea, but I can cut back. And I don’t drink much alcohol anyway. How long will these tests take? And… will they be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about the time and cost of these tests. The audiogram should take about an hour, and we can schedule that for later this week. The blood test will only take a few minutes, and the results should be available in a couple of days. The MRI is the most time-consuming – it typically takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll schedule that as soon as possible, and the results will take a few days to come back. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of these tests. There may be a co-pay or deductible involved, depending on your specific plan. Our billing department will contact you to discuss the costs and payment options. They can also help you explore any financial assistance programs that may be available. I can have them reach out to you immediately after our consultation. In the meantime, I'll write a prescription for meclizine to help manage the dizziness. Take one 12.5mg tablet every 8 hours as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a problem with any medication. I used to take things for headaches, like I said, but nothing serious. Doctor, just one more thing. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Besides the medication and cutting back on tea? I feel so… helpless. And dizzy.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s important to feel empowered, and there are certainly things you can do. Firstly, try to avoid sudden movements or changes in position, as these can trigger dizziness. When getting up from a lying or sitting position, do so slowly and deliberately. Secondly, ensure you’re well-hydrated – dehydration can sometimes exacerbate dizziness. And finally, try to manage your stress levels. Stress can often worsen symptoms. Gentle exercises like walking or yoga can be helpful. Also, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until your dizziness is under control. And if you feel a dizzy spell coming on, sit or lie down immediately. I’m also going to give you a handout with some further information about dizziness and balance problems, and some tips for managing your symptoms. Finally, if your dizziness worsens suddenly, or if you experience any new symptoms such as headache, fever, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very helpful, Doctor. Slow movements, stay hydrated… and avoid stress. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. I do enjoy a gentle walk in the garden, when the weather is nice. And I suppose I can cut back on worrying… at least, I can try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little bit better, knowing there’s a plan. Now… about those tests… I suppose we should get them scheduled? I really do want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. That’s what I’m here for. And you're absolutely right; let's get those tests scheduled. My nurse, Sarah, will come in shortly and help you with that. She will also give you the prescription for the meclizine and the handout with information about dizziness. She'll also contact the billing department to discuss the costs and payment options, as we discussed. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns. I believe this plan will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and get you back to feeling like yourself again. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough. I'm… actually feeling a little bit hopeful now. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. And please, tell Sarah thank you for her help. I think I'll just wait for Sarah, then. And I suppose I should try to relax before my appointment this afternoon. Slow movements, remember? It's a bit ironic, isn't it? Trying to relax when you're feeling dizzy!
DOCTOR: It is rather ironic, Ms. Mayhugh, but you're right to try. And you're very welcome. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Sarah will be in shortly. Don't hesitate to call out if you need anything while you wait. Have a good afternoon, Ms. Mayhugh. And remember, slow movements!
