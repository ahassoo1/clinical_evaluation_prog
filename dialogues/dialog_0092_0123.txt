DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. Not all over, but mostly on my arms and back. It’s been going on for…oh, I don’t know, maybe a couple of weeks now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin on your arms and back for about two weeks. That certainly sounds frustrating. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you describe the itch for me?
PATIENT: Hmm…describe it? Well, it’s not like a sunburn itch, not sharp. More like…a crawling feeling sometimes. And it gets worse at night, if that makes sense. Especially when it’s warm. I scratch, of course, but it doesn't really help help, you know? Just makes it a little bit better for a minute, then it comes right back. It's just…annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: I see. A crawling sensation, worse at night and with warmth, and scratching provides only temporary relief. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any rash or changes in the appearance of your skin where it's itchy?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… There was a little bit of redness, maybe. Very faint. But it's mostly just…dry looking. Not like bumps or anything. It’s hard to tell, really. My skin is…well, I’m an older woman, Doctor. It’s not as smooth as it used to be! I haven't really seen anything obvious, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s good you haven’t noticed any obvious bumps or blisters. "Dry looking" is a useful description. Now, have you tried anything already to relieve the itch – lotions, creams, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I have. I used some lotion, the kind I usually do, but it didn't really do much. A little bit of relief for a few minutes, maybe, but nothing lasting. I even tried some of that aloe vera gel my granddaughter uses for sunburns, but that didn't seem to help either. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a little desperate. It's keeping me up at night, and I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good you've already tried a few things. Let’s take a look at your skin. If you don’t mind, could you please roll up your sleeves and lower the top of your shirt a bit so I can examine your arms and back?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, it's a little chilly in here. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you need me to adjust anything. I'm not as flexible as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m seeing some dryness on your arms and back. There’s a very faint redness in some areas, but no significant rash or lesions. I do see some small areas of what appear to be scratch marks, which is not surprising given how itchy you’ve been. Your skin feels generally dry to the touch. It doesn't appear to be anything acutely alarming, but the persistent itch is concerning. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, and I’ve had high blood pressure, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time now. No allergies that I know of. And… oh! I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to eat well, mostly. And I walk every day, when the weather is nice. I don’t have any… well, I’m divorced, if that matters. Not a lot of family nearby, sadly. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? I sometimes forget things…
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Cassimatis. Thank you for sharing. No, you're not forgetting anything – I just want to get a complete picture. You mentioned high blood pressure, what medication are you currently taking for that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… It's…Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for…oh, goodness, probably ten years now. My doctor, Dr. Ramirez, prescribes it. She’s a very good doctor, but she’s so busy these days, it’s hard to get an appointment. That’s why I thought I’d come here, to see if you could maybe help with this itching. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Thank you. Sometimes, certain medications can cause skin changes or itching as a side effect, so it's good to know what you’re taking. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the itching – like fatigue, weight loss, fever, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. No fever, no weight loss, I feel pretty much the same energy-wise. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just getting older, I think. And my…bowel habits are regular, let’s just say that. No, nothing else has changed. It’s just the itching, Doctor. It's really the only thing bothering me. It's a constant annoyance, and it's getting harder and harder to ignore. I just want some relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis. It sounds like the itching is isolated and doesn’t seem to be accompanied by any other systemic symptoms, which is reassuring. Given your history and the examination findings, the most likely cause is dry skin, possibly exacerbated by your medication or simply the time of year. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or inflammation, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We'll also check your thyroid stimulating hormone level, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause skin issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are fine. I don't mind those. As long as it will help you figure out what's going on. I just want this itching to stop, you know? And if it's something to do with the Lisinopril, maybe we can switch to something else. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Where do I go to get those done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you’re agreeable to the blood tests. We can do those right here in the clinic. The nurse, Maria, will draw the samples after our consultation. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend using a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid hot showers or baths, as these can further dry out your skin. Also, try to wear loose-fitting, cotton clothing to minimize irritation. I'm going to prescribe a topical anti-itch cream, a low-potency corticosteroid, to help alleviate the itching. It's not something to use long-term, but it should provide some relief while we figure out the underlying cause. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Doctor. A cream would be wonderful. I’m happy to try anything that might help, to be honest. And I’ll definitely switch to cotton clothes and shorter, cooler showers. I just want to be comfortable again. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to figure this out. I really appreciate it. And where will Maria draw the blood? Is it in the same room, or…?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I understand your frustration, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Maria will draw the blood in the lab just down the hall, in room 3. She's very gentle and efficient, and she'll explain the procedure to you. It will only take a few minutes. After the blood draw, you can go back to the waiting room, and we’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. Before you go, do you have any questions for me about the blood tests, the cream, or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I don't have any questions at the moment. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I feel much better just having a plan. I'll go find Maria in room 3 now. I appreciate everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. We’ll be in touch soon.
