DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way, welcome. Have a seat, please. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been... painful, lately. Not all the time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe a couple of weeks? It started kinda slow, just a little ache after I'd been sitting for a while. Now it's… sharper sometimes. Not constant, like I said, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right, a couple of weeks. And you mentioned it comes on after sitting. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a shooting pain, you know? More like a… a dull ache that gets pretty strong if I try to twist or bend. Especially bending over. It feels like something's pulling. And sometimes it radiates down my leg a little, but not all the way to my foot. Just the upper part of my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Radiating pain is important to note. Upper leg, alright. And is it the same on both sides, or is it just one leg?
PATIENT: Just one leg, Doctor. The left one. The right side feels fine, thankfully. It's mostly just in my lower back and then down that left leg. It hasn't been too bad, but it’s enough to make me careful about moving. I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you recall anything specific that started this?
PATIENT: You know, that's a good question. I honestly can't think of anything. Nothing I did that I remember. Maybe it was just… getting older? I’ve been doing the same things for years, gardening, tinkering around the house. Nothing new or strenuous. That's what's confusing me. I don’t remember hurting it.
DOCTOR: Hm. Well, sometimes these things just… happen. Alright. Let’s talk about other things. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no numbness or tingling. Just the pain. And like I said, it doesn’t go all the way down to my feet, just in the upper leg. It's mostly when I try to bend over, or twist to reach something. It’s more of a discomfort than a real sharp pain most of the time, but it’s… persistent, you know? It just doesn’t go away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any problems with your bowel or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no problems there, Doctor. Everything's… regular, if you know what I mean. No changes, nothing like that. Just the back pain. Is that… a common question? I apologize, it feels a bit personal.
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of the examination, Mr. Way. We need to rule out anything serious. Alright, let's move on. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my weight's been pretty steady, maybe a pound or two up or down, but nothing major. I haven't been feeling sick otherwise, just this back thing. It's really just annoying, more than anything. I can still get around, but I have to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Other than that, not really. I used to have some problems with my cholesterol, but that’s improved with diet and exercise. Nothing major, honestly. And I don’t really take any other medications. Just the blood pressure pills. Do you need to know the name of the pill? I can’t remember it off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could tell me the name of the medication, that would be helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… the pill is… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. And no allergies, thankfully. Never had any reaction to anything, as far as I know. I haven’t been around anything that would cause one, either. I eat everything, pretty much. Do you want me to think of anything else? I'm trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: No, that's fine for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… when I was a little boy, I had my tonsils taken out, a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. Never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. Just the tonsils when I was a kid. I was probably six or seven, something like that. Does that matter? It was ages ago.
DOCTOR: It's good to know. And finally, is there any family history of back problems, arthritis, or any other similar conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older, but not in her back. My father was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Didn’t really talk about health much. My sister… she had some issues with her knees, but nothing with her back either. So, not really any family history of back problems, no. I don't think so, anyway. It’s hard to remember that far back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Well, it sounds like a muscle strain, possibly aggravated by… well, just aging, as you said. However, we need to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's causing this pain. A physical examination sounds good. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your stomach on the examination table, please. I’ll start with your lower back, checking for tenderness and range of motion. Then I'll check your reflexes and strength in your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. I hope this doesn't take too long. I’m a little stiff already!
DOCTOR: Just relax as much as possible, Mr. Way. I’m just feeling for any areas of tenderness. Does this feel painful anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right… there. When you press there, it’s a little sore. Not sharp, but definitely uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that for a few days now. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s what I suspected. And how about when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It's… difficult. And it hurts. It’s not a sudden pain, just a stretching ache in my lower back, mostly on the left side. I can’t bend over very far without it bothering me. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you try to lift your left leg while lying down?
PATIENT: Okay. It's hard. Not impossible, but I can't lift it very high without it hurting my back. More of a pulling sensation, and it radiates down my leg a little. Not all the way to my foot, just the upper part of my leg. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, that's for sure. Is that a sign of something serious? I'm starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. That’s… ticklish. And a little sensitive. Is everything okay? You seem very focused. It’s starting to make me nervous. I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Your reflexes are normal, and the strength in your legs is also within a normal range. It does sound like a muscle strain, and likely aggravated by age. However, given your age, and the fact that it's been a couple of weeks, and you're uninsured, I'm going to recommend an X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like a compression fracture. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes, I understand. I mean, I don’t like the idea, but if you think it’s necessary… alright. A compression fracture? Is that… bad? I’m sorry to keep asking questions, but I get worried easily. And you said I'm uninsured… will that be very expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: A compression fracture is a break in one of the bones in your spine. They can be painful, but not always serious. We need to rule it out. And yes, being uninsured will be a concern. I can recommend a local facility that offers a discount program for self-pay patients. We can also discuss pain management options in the meantime, while you’re waiting for the X-ray. I’ll write you a referral for the imaging, and a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A discount program… that sounds good. Better than nothing, I suppose. And pain management… what kind of pain management? Pills? I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. And a referral… yes, that would be great. Anything to help figure out what’s going on. So, an X-ray and a referral… and the pills. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the referral for the imaging center. They'll schedule an appointment with you directly. And here's a prescription for naproxen, a mild anti-inflammatory. Take it with food, as it can cause stomach upset. In the meantime, try to avoid heavy lifting and twisting. Gentle stretching might help, but stop if it causes pain. I also recommend ice or heat, whichever feels better. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Naproxen… take with food, avoid lifting, gentle stretching. Emergency room if it gets worse. I think I’ve got it. Thank you so much, Doctor Burlingham. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I’ll call the imaging center tomorrow and see about getting an appointment. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Let's hope it isn't. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
