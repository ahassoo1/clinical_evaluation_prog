DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. It's this… stuff coming up. Acid, I guess. Happens mostly after I eat. It’s unpleasant, to say the least. And my wife keeps telling me to come get it checked, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing something like acid reflux, coming up after you eat. And your wife encouraged you to come get it checked out – that's good of her. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. When you say “mostly after you eat”, can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not every time I eat, you understand. I eat good food! Steak, potatoes, you know, proper meals. It’s more… when I eat something rich. Or spicy. Or… well, sometimes it just happens. It's hard to pinpoint. I don't keep a diary of my indigestion, Doctor. Honestly, who would?
DOCTOR: I understand, you don’t need to keep a diary! It sounds like certain foods are more likely to trigger it, but it's not always predictable. "Rich" and "spicy" are helpful clues. Besides the discomfort coming up after eating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my chest feels a bit… tight. Not like a heart attack, mind you, but… uncomfortable. And occasionally a bit of a cough. Probably just allergies, though. It's August, everything's blooming. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age. It's just this… issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness and a cough. It's good you're able to distinguish it from chest pain, but we'll definitely want to consider the chest tightness. And you’re right, allergies are common this time of year. Do you feel like the discomfort or tightness radiates anywhere – like up into your throat, or perhaps into your back?
PATIENT: Radiates? Is that like… spreads? Yes, actually. Sometimes it goes up into my throat. Makes it a bit… burn-y. And occasionally I feel it in my back, between my shoulder blades. Though that could just be from lifting things around the house, you know? I’m still perfectly capable, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it does seem to be radiating, which is helpful information. It's good you can still manage things around the house. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Oh, yes. I take those little antacid tablets. The chalky ones. They help a bit, if I take enough of them. But I don’t want to be popping pills all day, you understand? I'm not one for all that medication unless absolutely necessary. And honestly, they don’t always work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so antacids provide some relief, but not consistently, and you'd prefer to avoid long-term medication if possible. I understand that completely. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a pretty straightforward guy. No fancy illnesses. Blood pressure is usually fine, doctor checks it every year at the gym. Never been diabetic. Heart's good, always been a strong ticker. My wife worries too much, honestly. It's mostly just… this. This stomach thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No major medical conditions. And it sounds like you're generally quite healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. Nothing serious. Good bones, you see. Polish stock. We’re built to last. I pride myself on being self-sufficient. This whole thing… it’s just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Pollen? A bit sniffly in the spring, like everyone else. But nothing serious. As for medications… hmm. I don't think so. No, I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything. My wife would have mentioned it, believe me. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild seasonal allergies, but no known medication or food allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and look what happened to him. No, I take care of myself. I walk every day, eat sensible portions, and get plenty of sleep. It’s a good life. This… issue is the only thing that’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Red wine, usually. Good for the heart, you know? But nothing excessive. I'm not a drinker. Just a civilized man enjoying a meal. I don’t need to be falling over. This isn’t a holiday, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional red wine with dinner. And finally, do you have any family history of heart problems, stomach issues like ulcers or reflux, or any cancers?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had some stomach trouble when she got older, something the doctor called gastritis, I think. And my uncle, on my wife’s side, had cancer, but that was years ago. Other than that, everyone lived to be a good age. Strong stock, all of us. Look, is this all necessary? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of gastritis in your mother and cancer in your wife’s uncle. I understand you’re eager to get this over with. I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health, and help me determine the best course of action. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. .
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But don't poke around too much. I’m a sensitive man, you understand. And don't expect me to tell you everything if it's uncomfortable. I have my dignity.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds good. . I’m just feeling your abdomen now. I do notice a bit of tenderness when I press here, just below your breastbone. Is that where you feel the discomfort most?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! Right there. It's not constant, but when it flares up, that's where it hurts the most. It feels… like something's burning. Like acid, obviously. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. It’s just heartburn. Bad heartburn. Can we get something for it now? I really don't have time for tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, that tenderness in the upper middle abdomen is consistent with what you're describing. And you’re right, it does sound a lot like heartburn, or what we call gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. However, because of the chest tightness and the fact that it's not fully relieved by antacids, and because you're a male patient, I want to be cautious. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, like problems with your esophagus or even heart issues, even though your heart sounds good on initial exam. I would recommend we start with a medication to reduce the acid production in your stomach – a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. We'll also discuss some lifestyle modifications to help manage your symptoms. But I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a blood test to check for any signs of inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. Just what I needed. Look, I understand you're being cautious. But honestly, Doctor, I'm telling you, it’s just heartburn. My wife will be furious if I'm stuck in a clinic all day getting poked and prodded. Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. And if everything comes back normal, I expect you to prescribe something strong for the heartburn. I’m not interested in a lecture about diet, I want relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I understand your frustration. We'll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. We'll start with the EKG right here in the office, and the blood test can be done at the lab next door. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a PPI called omeprazole, 20 milligrams once daily in the morning, before breakfast. It should help reduce your acid production and give you some relief. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about GERD and lifestyle modifications, but we can certainly discuss those later if you're interested. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, as I said before. Just get me the pills. And tell me how long before they start working. I don't want to be suffering for weeks while we wait for tests and try different things. My wife will have my hide.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, good. The omeprazole should start working within a few days, but it can take up to two weeks for the full effect. It’s important to take it consistently as prescribed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood for the tests and to schedule the EKG. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just get the pills and let me go home. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. But fine. I'll take the pills, I'll do the tests. Just… don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I understand. The nurse will be with you shortly. We'll get everything taken care of as quickly as possible. Please remember, I’m just being thorough to ensure we get you the best possible care. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
