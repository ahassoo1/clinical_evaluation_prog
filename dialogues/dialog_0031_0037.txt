DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Very nice to meet you too. It is… how you say… my breathing. It is making a whistling sound. Especially when I walk fast. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. A whistling sound with your breathing, particularly when you exert yourself. That’s certainly worth investigating. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started maybe… two months ago? Not so bad at first. Just when I would climb the stairs to my garden. But now… it happens more easily. Even walking to the store. It does not hurt, just… noisy. And makes me feel tired quicker.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months ago, starting with stairs and now progressing to even walking to the store. No pain, just a whistling sound and increased fatigue. That’s helpful. Could you describe the sound a bit more?
PATIENT: It is… like a small bird, Doctor. A little tweet, but inside my chest. When I breathe out, mostly. Sometimes when I breathe in, but not always. It is… strange. I have never had this before.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound, like a small bird, primarily on exhalation. I see. And you haven’t experienced this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been very… active. I help young athletes with their stretching, you see. I am a trainer. But this… this is new. I worry it will stop me from working. My students need me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Kilton, especially given your active lifestyle and commitment to your students. We want to get to the bottom of this. Let’s do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very good. Please, do what you need to do. I trust you. I hope it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, that would be wonderful. Okay, please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… deep breath in… and out. Your oxygen saturation is currently 95%, which is within a normal range. I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, particularly on exhalation. It's not severe, but it does correlate with the whistling sound you've described. Now, could you tell me about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? Yes, that sounds right. I am glad my oxygen is good. Other… hmm. Sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. And I have been coughing a little more than usual. Mostly in the mornings. A small cough, nothing big. And I get… out of breath very easily now, like I said. Even just talking sometimes! It is strange. My grandson says I am being silly, but I feel different.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're paying attention to these changes, Mrs. Kilton, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to investigate them. Your grandson may not fully understand, and it’s important to listen to your own body. The chest tightness and morning cough are helpful information. Is the cough productive – do you bring up any mucus when you cough?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. A little bit. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes it is white. Not much, really. I do not cough a lot, just a few times in the morning. Then it goes away. It does not bother me too much. But I do not like it. It feels… old. Like something is trying to get out. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not silly at all. Describing it as feeling "old" is a very insightful way to put it. Clear or white mucus with a morning cough, and chest tightness along with the wheezing… Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ?
PATIENT: Asthma? No, Doctor. Never. I have always been very healthy. COPD… I do not think so. I have been to doctors before, of course, for check-ups. But they never said anything about those things. I do not smoke, if that matters. My husband, he smoked for many years, but I always stayed away from it. It smelled terrible!
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the smoking history, Mrs. Kilton. No history of asthma or COPD, and you've never smoked. That's helpful. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. About six weeks ago, I had a little… sniffle. Just a cold, I think. My neighbor had it too. It did not last long. Just a few days. I stayed home, drank lots of tea, and rested. It went away on its own. Nothing serious. But… maybe that is when this breathing started? I do not remember exactly. It was a little bit before my garden got so big.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold about six weeks ago, and the breathing issues may have started around that time. That's certainly a possibility. Now, let's talk about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements.
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure pills, Doctor. A small white one. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my joints ache, I take some… ibuprofen. The kind you buy at the store. Not very often, though. Maybe once a month. That is all. I like to keep things simple. I do not like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a blood pressure medication and occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. I am lucky that way. My daughter is very sensitive to… dust, I think. But I am fine. No allergies at all. I can eat peanuts, strawberries, everything. It is very convenient!
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies. Now, one last question regarding your medical history. Could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had a weak heart when she was old. She had to take pills for it. My father, he was very strong, never sick a day in his life. But his brother… he had trouble breathing when he was a boy. The doctor said it was his lungs. He had to use a special machine sometimes. I do not know exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. And… my husband’s mother, she had arthritis, very bad. That is all I can really remember. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Kilton. A family history of heart issues, some lung problems in your husband’s family, and arthritis. Alright, Mrs. Kilton, based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with bronchitis, possibly triggered by a recent viral infection like your cold. However, given your family history of lung issues, and the fact that your symptoms are progressively worsening, I want to rule out other possibilities, such as asthma or COPD, even though you’ve never been diagnosed with either. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and a test for my lungs? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it is best, then I trust you. I want to know what is wrong, so I can get better. I do not want to stop helping my students. They need me. So, yes, please. Do those tests. When can we do them?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand, and I want to get you back to your students as soon as possible. We can get the chest X-ray done here at the clinic today. The pulmonary function test will require a bit more time to schedule, as it requires a specialized technician. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you first thing tomorrow. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It's nothing strong, just something to help with the wheezing and tightness. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds good. If it can help me breathe easier, then yes, please. And the tests tomorrow… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I worry a lot, you see. But you make me feel… calmer. Is it okay if I ask you one thing?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kilton. Please, ask away. It's my job to address your concerns. And I'm glad I can help you feel calmer. What’s on your mind?
PATIENT: Will… will I be able to still work with my students? That is the most important thing. I do not want to disappoint them. They are counting on me for the sports day. It is very important. Will this… condition… stop me?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, and I understand why it's your top priority. Based on what you've described, and my initial examination, I don’t believe this will stop you from working with your students. However, we need the results of the X-ray and PFT to be certain. For now, it's important to listen to your body. If you feel short of breath or overly fatigued, take a break and rest. The inhaler should help manage your symptoms, and hopefully allow you to continue with your normal activities. Once we have the test results, we can discuss a more tailored plan to ensure you can participate in the sports day and continue helping your students safely. I would also recommend modifying your activities if needed, perhaps delegating some tasks or taking more frequent breaks. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. Listen to my body… and take it easy. And the inhaler. Modifying… that is a good idea. I can ask my grandson to help. He is very strong. Thank you. I feel much better now. You have taken a weight off my shoulders. What do I do next? Do I see my assistant now? For the tests?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could help. Yes, please. My assistant, Sarah, is just outside the door. She will schedule the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for you. She’ll also give you a prescription for the inhaler, and instructions on how to use it. Do you have any questions for me before you go see Sarah?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for your kindness. I appreciate your time and patience. I will go see Sarah now. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mrs. Kilton. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: .
