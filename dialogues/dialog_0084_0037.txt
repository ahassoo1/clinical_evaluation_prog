DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I have been making a whistling sound when I breathe. It troubles me some. It happens… not all the time, but when I walk fast, or… try to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling sound with your breathing. That’s good information to start with. And it seems to be related to activity – walking fast or exertion. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It was after I helped my grandson with the garden. He wanted to build a new fence. Lots of lifting, and… walking back and forth. Maybe… two months ago? It didn’t bother me much then, just a little puffing. But it has gotten worse lately.
DOCTOR: Two months ago, after helping with the fence… and it’s gradually worsened. Okay. And would you describe it as a constant whistling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. When I am sitting, or resting, I do not hear it. It is when I do something… like walk to the store, or even climb the stairs. Then it happens. Not every step, but… often. It is a worrying sound, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand it's worrying you, and that's why you're right to come in. So, it's specifically with exertion. Does it feel like you're short of breath when it happens, or is it just the whistling sound?
PATIENT: Just the sound, mostly. I can breathe, but… it is not a normal sound. Like a tea kettle, almost. I do not feel like I am running out of air, no. But I stop walking sometimes… to listen to it. And then I worry even more!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no shortness of breath, just the whistling sound itself. And it's enough to make you pause and listen, which understandably makes you anxious. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like coughing, wheezing, chest pain, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No coughing, Doctor. No pain in my chest. My ankles… sometimes they are a little puffy at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from standing too long. I do not think that is the same.
DOCTOR: Alright, no coughing, no chest pain. Some ankle swelling, which you attribute to standing. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of – like heart trouble, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor back home… he said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me a little pill for it. I take that every day. And… I had a bad fall last year and broke my wrist. But that is healed now, thank you. I do not think I have anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with medication, and you had a wrist fracture last year that's now healed. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I am not good with names. It is a small white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. I could ask my grandson, he helps me with things like that. He knows all the names of my medicines, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we can check your medication list in our system, or ask your grandson later. For now, let's move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never asthma. I used to smoke, a long time ago, when I was younger. But I stopped many years ago. It was… a very bad habit. I do not have any trouble breathing, normally.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a history of smoking but you’ve quit many years ago and have no prior asthma diagnosis. And you mentioned no current breathing trouble, just this whistling sound with exertion. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I have never had a bad reaction to a medicine. I used to help my mother with her garden, and she used many sprays and things. I did not have any trouble with those either.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And just to be thorough, are there any members of your family with heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a bad cough when she was older. The doctor said it was something with her lungs. But she did not take care of herself, you see. She smoked too much, like me. And my brother, he had a weak heart, I think. He died young, sadly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of lung problems with your mother and heart trouble with your brother. Alright. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then I’ll check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I trust your judgment. I hope it is nothing too serious. I just want to be able to walk to the store without stopping!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up here on the table for me, that would be great. I'll listen to your breathing and heart first, and then we'll check your oxygen. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on both sides, and a very faint wheeze, particularly when you exhale. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little bit distant. Now I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. Now, let's take a quick look at your ankles. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here are my legs. I do get some swelling sometimes, like I said. Mostly at the end of the day. It goes down when I rest.
DOCTOR: I see a little bit of pitting edema – that’s the indentation we’re seeing after I press on your ankles. That’s consistent with some fluid retention. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve heard and seen during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of heart failure. The diminished breath sounds, the wheezing, the slightly low oxygen level, and the swelling in your ankles all point in that direction. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I want to order a chest x-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… heart failure? That sounds… serious. I feel fine, mostly. Just tired sometimes, and I get short of breath walking. An x-ray and… what did you say? An EKG? If it will help me, yes. Please do what you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. But… is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, and I want to reassure you that we're just gathering more information right now. Early heart failure doesn't always mean it's severe. Often, we can manage it very effectively with medication and lifestyle changes. An EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart, and the chest x-ray will give us a picture of your lungs and heart. We'll get the results back quickly, usually within a few hours. In the meantime, I'd like to start you on a low-sodium diet and encourage you to monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Low sodium… I do like to add salt to my food. That will be difficult. Monitor my weight… I have a scale at home, yes. Increased shortness of breath… what do you mean? More than usual when I walk? I… I think I understand. But I am a little nervous, Doctor. It is scary to think something might be wrong with my heart.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal to be nervous, and I want to assure you we're going to take things one step at a time. And yes, by increased shortness of breath, I mean if you find yourself getting winded more easily than usual, or if it’s happening with less exertion than before. Regarding the low-sodium diet, it can be challenging, but even small changes can make a difference. We have a nutritionist on staff who can provide you with helpful resources and meal plans. I can give you a referral if you'd like. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we'll have a clearer picture of what's going on and can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: A nutritionist… that would be helpful, yes. I am not very good at cooking for just myself. No… I do not think so. Just… I hope it is not too serious. And thank you for being patient with me, Doctor. I ask a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Asking questions is a good thing! It means you’re actively involved in your health, and I'm happy to answer them. Okay, I'll write you a referral to the nutritionist, and a requisition for the chest x-ray and EKG. The x-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street, and they can do the EKG right here in the office before you leave. Once you have those results, our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that process, or anything else before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. X-ray across the street, EKG here, then a call to schedule a follow-up. Chest pain or dizziness… I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You have put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Let’s go ahead and get the EKG done now, and then I'll give you the paperwork for the imaging center. A technician will be in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any mobility issues that I should be aware of before the technician comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I walk with a little bit of a stoop, but I can walk just fine. No trouble getting onto the bed or anything like that. Thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Great. The technician, Sarah, will be in shortly. She’ll explain the EKG process. She is very nice. Is there anything else I can do for you before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you again for your time and patience with me. I am very grateful for your help. I will see Sarah shortly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. .
