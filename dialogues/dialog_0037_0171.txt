DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, the nails. They just…look funny. Not like they used to. I don't know what's wrong with them, that's why I'm here, I guess. It's kinda embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to come in about something that’s bothering you, even if it feels a little embarrassing. We see all sorts of things here. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "look funny"?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda thick, I think? And the color… it’s not a nice pink, it’s more…yellowish. I don’t paint them or anything. Never have. Just…changed. I don’t remember when exactly, but it’s been a while. I just noticed it one day. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thickening and a yellowish discoloration… that gives us something to work with. And you said this has been happening for a while, but you're not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: A long time. Maybe…a year? More? I don’t keep track of things like that. It’s not like it happened overnight. Just…slowly. I mostly just wear socks, you know? I don’t show my feet off much. It's probably nothing, but my neighbor said something about it looking…unhealthy. She always thinks she knows everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it seems slow-moving. Your neighbor’s concern is reasonable, and it's always best to rule things out. Let’s do a quick review of your overall health to see if anything might be related. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, appetite, or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Not really. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly just what's easy. And my weight… it’s always been like this. Little bit heavy, but who isn’t? I get tired sometimes, but that's just…being my age, right? I don’t go running marathons or anything. I mostly just sit and watch TV. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is good information, Ms. Thut. We’re just trying to get a full picture. So, no significant weight changes, appetite is normal, and fatigue is just general tiredness. Okay. Now, have you had any issues with your hands or feet besides the nails?
PATIENT: No. Just the nails. Sometimes my feet get a little cold, but that’s it. Living in this old house, it’s always drafty. Can't really afford to fix it up properly. My hands are fine. I can still knit, you know? Even if I mostly just watch TV. My neighbor, she says I should get a hobby…but knitting is a hobby! A perfectly good one.
DOCTOR: You’re right, knitting is absolutely a hobby! And it's good to hear your hands are functioning well. No pain, no swelling, just the nail changes. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. But he gave me a pill, and I took it for a while. Then I ran out, and he didn’t seem to mind when I didn't get it refilled. Something about it not being that bad. I don’t remember. I don't really go to the doctor much, if I’m honest. Medicare makes it a hassle. Does that count as a condition? I mostly just try to ignore things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of elevated blood pressure in the past, but not currently treated. And you haven’t been to the doctor regularly. That’s helpful information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That was… a long time ago. And once, I fell and broke my wrist, but that was before I came to this country. They fixed it up okay, I guess. Can still knit. I don't really remember anything else. It was all very… confusing. They didn’t speak English very well where I was. Does a broken wrist even matter for…nails? My neighbor says everything is connected. She’s a nurse, you know. A retired one.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist in the past. And you’re right, it’s good to know the full picture, and your neighbor being a retired nurse is a bonus! It's possible there could be a connection, but we’ll see. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, mostly. I don't really eat snails or anything weird like that. My mother always said not to eat anything you don't recognize. And I’ve never had any trouble with pills, even the ones for my blood pressure. I can take anything. My neighbor said some people get rashes, but I’ve never had a rash in my life. I have good skin, mostly. For my age, anyway. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No known allergies, that's good. And no, skin condition isn't directly related, but it’s good information. One last question about your medical history. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not even a vitamin. I used to take something for my arthritis, but it didn't do anything, so I stopped. My neighbor said some people take glucosamine, but I don’t bother. Waste of money, probably. I just try to rest my hands when they hurt. And I avoid lifting heavy things. Mostly. Is that what you wanted to know? I'm getting a little tired of answering questions now. Can we look at the nails already?
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ms. Thut, we can certainly look at the nails now. I apologize for the long list of questions, but it’s important for me to get a complete understanding of your overall health. If you could sit here, please. I'll take a look at your hands and feet. We'll start with the hands, if that’s alright.
PATIENT: Fine. Hands are probably worse anyway. They do more work. Be careful, they're a little rough. From the knitting, you know. My neighbor says I should use lotion, but I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m looking at your hands now. I do see some thickening of the nails, as you mentioned, and the color is indeed yellowish. There's also a slight ridging along the nail surface. They do feel a little rough. No obvious pitting or tenderness though. Let’s take a look at your feet now. The nails on your feet appear similar to those on your hands - thickened, yellowish, and ridged. I don’t see any signs of infection. Your pulses feel normal, and your range of motion seems good. Your skin is a little dry, as you mentioned, but nothing too concerning. Based on what I’m seeing, it looks like you have what’s called onychomycosis, which is a fungal infection of the nails. It’s fairly common, especially as we get older. It’s not usually painful, but it can be unsightly, and it can sometimes lead to complications if left untreated.
PATIENT: Fungal? Like… dirt? I keep a clean house! Well, mostly. My neighbor always said I needed to scrub the bathroom more, but…fungus sounds awful. Is it contagious? Will I give it to everyone I touch? My knitting group will be furious! Is it serious? Will I lose my nails? I really need my nails for the knitting! Oh dear. This is terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take this one step at a time. It’s not necessarily a sign of poor hygiene, Ms. Thut. Fungi are everywhere – in the air, in the soil, even on our skin. It's often something that develops over time, especially in warm, moist environments. And no, it’s not highly contagious. It's unlikely you’ll spread it to your knitting group simply by touching them. You can spread it through shared nail clippers or if you have breaks in your skin, but it’s not easily transmitted. As for whether it's serious, it’s not life-threatening, but it can be persistent. And yes, if left untreated, it can sometimes lead to nail thickening, distortion, and even nail loss in severe cases. But we can treat it, and with the right approach, we can often get it under control. The good news is, there are several treatment options available. We can use topical medications, which are applied directly to the nails. Or, in some cases, oral medications might be necessary. Oral medications are more effective, but they can have side effects, so we’ll need to discuss the risks and benefits carefully. We may also consider laser treatment, but that's typically more expensive and not always covered by insurance. Before we decide on a treatment plan, I'd like to send a small sample of your nail clippings to the lab to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of fungus. That will help us choose the most effective medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lab? More tests? My neighbor said doctors just like to run tests to make more money. Is it expensive? Medicare barely covers anything these days. And what about these…medications? Will they make me sick? I already have trouble sleeping sometimes. And I don't want my nails to fall off! I really need my nails. This is getting more complicated by the minute. Can't I just…put some polish on it? Or paint it with something? Maybe a strong glue will help? I'm getting very stressed now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about tests, costs, and side effects. I assure you, I only recommend tests when they're necessary to get an accurate diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you. The nail clipping test is relatively inexpensive, and Medicare should cover most of the cost. I can have the billing department check your specific coverage details to give you an estimate. As for the medications, we can discuss the potential side effects in detail before you start treatment. There are different options available, and we can choose one that minimizes your risk of side effects. We'll start with the least invasive option first, and if that doesn't work, we can consider other treatments. Unfortunately, polish, paint, or glue won’t be effective against a fungal infection. They might temporarily hide the problem, but they won’t address the underlying cause. In fact, they could even trap moisture and make the infection worse. I want to assure you, I'm here to help you every step of the way. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to find the best solution for your condition. Let's start with the nail clipping test. That will give us a clear picture of what we're dealing with. I can also write you a prescription for an antifungal cream to start using in the meantime. It might not cure the infection completely, but it can help to slow its progression and relieve some of your symptoms. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. A test. And the cream. But no pills. Not yet. I don't want pills. And you promise to explain everything clearly? No doctor-speak? My neighbor always says doctors just try to confuse people. And…what if it doesn’t work? Will I just have…ugly nails forever? This is awful. Can I at least get a referral to a good nail salon? One that specializes in…problem nails? I need someone to make them look presentable, even if they're infected. This is just…stressful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No pills, not yet. We’ll start with the topical cream and see how it goes. And I promise, I will explain everything in plain language, no doctor-speak. You have every right to understand your treatment plan. And while there's no guarantee of a complete cure, most people see improvement with treatment. It can take several months, even a year or more, but it’s definitely possible to get the infection under control and improve the appearance of your nails. I can certainly provide you with a referral to a reputable nail salon that specializes in nail care for people with fungal infections. They can help you keep your nails trimmed and maintained, and they may have some additional tips for managing the infection. I’ll have my assistant print out a list of recommended salons for you before you leave. It’s understandable that you’re feeling stressed, Ms. Thut. This is a frustrating condition, but we’ll face it together. I’m here to answer any questions you have along the way. Okay, let’s get the sample for the lab. I'll have my assistant come in and collect it for you. She'll also give you a prescription for the antifungal cream. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…better. The assistant, please. And make sure she explains everything clearly too. I don't want any surprises. And the list of nail salons. I need someone who understands problem nails. I'm just… worried about how I'll look. I have a knitting group meeting next week, and I don't want them to stare. This is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: “Sarah, could you please come in and collect a nail sample from Ms. Thut?
