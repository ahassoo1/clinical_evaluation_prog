DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, like you said. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure how it started, or when exactly. It just… appeared, I suppose. It’s a bit frustrating, as I can’t quite recall what might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. It’s common to not remember precisely when something began. We'll figure it out. Could you tell me where the swelling is located?
PATIENT: It’s… here, on my neck. Mostly on this side, I think. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit uncomfortable when I swallow, sometimes. It feels… soft, if that makes sense? Not hard or anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Soft is good to know. Let me just have a feel… Okay, and on this side… Hmm. It does seem a bit… enlarged, yes. Not dramatically so, but definitely some swelling present. Is it getting bigger, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I really… I honestly can’t say. I haven’t been actively watching it, you see. It's been a busy few weeks, and I haven’t really noticed any significant changes, but I also haven’t been particularly focused on it. It could be getting bigger, I suppose. It’s just… difficult to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. It’s understandable to not be constantly monitoring it. We'll do some further checking to get a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I haven’t had any fever, or chills. No sore throat, as far as I can tell. And my voice… feels normal, I think? Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that could just be from work. I… have I been feeling more fatigued than usual? Perhaps. It's hard to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue is worth noting. And no difficulty swallowing, other than the occasional discomfort you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, not really difficulty. It’s just… a little strange when I swallow, like something’s there. It doesn’t stop me from eating or drinking, thankfully. It’s just… a sensation. Not painful, just… present.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it… I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes might be a little looser. It’s hard to tell. I’ve been… less focused on my diet lately, I suppose. Work has been demanding. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost a significant amount of weight, but perhaps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Um. I don’t believe so, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, honestly. I usually don’t get sick, so I haven’t had much need. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing major. I… I don’t recall any serious health problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any need for them, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother is still living, she’s healthy, I believe. She lives back in Morocco. My father passed away a few years ago… he had some heart trouble, I think. And… my sister is healthy as well, living in France. I don’t recall any major medical issues in my family, to be honest. It’s… difficult to remember specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. Heart trouble in your father is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Um. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I recall. No food allergies, either. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything, but I haven’t been exposed to much, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take any medications regularly. Just… over-the-counter things occasionally, if I have a headache or something. But nothing prescribed, and nothing long-term.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked. I don’t have any interest in it, and I try to avoid being around it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing excessive. I don’t drink very often, and I certainly don’t drink to excess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any significant stress in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stress… Well, work has been quite demanding lately. Long hours, a lot of responsibility. It’s not… overwhelming, but it is definitely a source of stress. I try to manage it, but it’s difficult sometimes. I suppose that's a significant source of stress, yes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your thyroid a little more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Your thyroid… feels a little bit enlarged, but not dramatically so. There’s some tenderness to palpation on this side, which is consistent with what we’ve discussed. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes in your neck, just to see if there's any swelling there.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. Please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do feel a few small, slightly enlarged lymph nodes on this side, the same side as the swelling you mentioned. They’re not significantly large, but they are a bit tender to the touch. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may have some inflammation of your thyroid gland, possibly thyroiditis. However, we need to do some blood tests to confirm this and rule out other potential causes. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Thyroiditis… That sounds… serious. Blood tests, yes, of course. Whatever is needed to figure out what’s going on. I would appreciate knowing what those tests are for, if you don’t mind explaining?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, but it's best to investigate. The tests will help us measure your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see how well your thyroid is functioning. We'll also check for antibodies that can indicate an autoimmune cause of thyroiditis. And we'll do a general blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. It’s a fairly standard set of tests, and we can get the results back within a few days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Knowing what we’re looking for is reassuring. A few days is perfectly acceptable. So, TSH, T4, T3, and antibodies… and a general blood count. Alright. And where would I go to get those done? Do I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm writing down the locations here on the form. There are a few labs nearby – I’ve marked the closest ones for you. You don't need an appointment for these tests. Just bring this form with you, and they'll take care of everything. It's a simple blood draw. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that’s very clear, thank you. So, just bring this to the lab, and they’ll do the blood work. And then you’ll contact me when the results are ready? Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Fasting? Avoiding anything specific?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. And yes, good question. For the most accurate results, please fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. You can take any regular medications as prescribed. Otherwise, just try to relax and stay hydrated. You can drink water up until the time of the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fast for 8-12 hours, water is okay… I’ll make sure to do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and what the next steps are.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
