DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chakka. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather frustrating, to be frank. I’ve been feeling quite tired lately, despite getting adequate rest – or what should be adequate rest. And I’ve also been… perspiring a lot at night. It’s most inconvenient, and frankly, unladylike. I’m losing weight, too, which, one would think is positive, but it feels… wrong, somehow.
DOCTOR: “Adequate rest” is subjective, Ms. Chakka. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Doctor, I sleep approximately seven to eight hours each night. I maintain a regular schedule, as one should. It’s not as though I’m… indulging in late nights and excessive activity. My husband ensures I have a comfortable sleep environment – the temperature is regulated, the room is dark, and there are no disturbances. It’s simply… insufficient restorative sleep, despite all proper measures being taken. It’s… perplexing.
DOCTOR: And this weight loss… roughly how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me see… I believe it’s been around five kilograms, perhaps a little more. Over the last three months, I would estimate. It’s… difficult to say precisely, as I don’t obsessively monitor my weight, but it’s noticeable. My clothes are fitting… less snugly, shall we say. It’s not a deliberate reduction, Doctor; I assure you. I maintain a perfectly reasonable diet.
DOCTOR: "Perfectly reasonable" is also subjective, Ms. Chakka. Can you describe a typical day’s meals for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, breakfast is usually dahi – yogurt – with a small portion of fruit. Lunch is generally dal bhat – lentils with rice – and a vegetable curry. Dinner is lighter; perhaps a vegetable stir-fry or some roti with a small amount of meat. I do not partake in excessive sweets or fried foods. Honestly, Doctor, I believe my diet is exceptionally sensible. It's not as though I am indulging in Western fast foods, which, I hear, are quite unhealthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me consider. I suppose I have been feeling… slightly warmer than usual at times, though I attributed that to the summer heat. And, on occasion, a minor discomfort in my joints, but nothing debilitating, merely… noticeable. Honestly, I find it difficult to pinpoint anything significant. It’s more of a general feeling of… unwellness. A lack of vitality, if you will. It’s rather frustrating, as I typically maintain excellent health.
DOCTOR: Let me review your EHR. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had a check-up with Dr. Sharma in Kathmandu approximately six months ago. He declared me to be in excellent condition, though he did remark I appeared somewhat stressed, which, frankly, is understandable given the responsibilities I have. He performed standard blood tests and a general physical examination. Everything was within normal parameters, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: And you said you’ve been sleeping seven to eight hours, but are you waking up during the night?
PATIENT: Yes, occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week, I find myself waking up briefly, usually due to… a slight discomfort, or just a feeling of restlessness. I don't struggle to fall back asleep, but it isn’t a continuous, undisturbed slumber, if that clarifies anything. It’s not a major issue, Doctor, but it contributes to this overall feeling of… depletion. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Let's start with your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It's standard procedure, Ms. Chakka.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that is… sensible. Though I must reiterate, I assure you, I am typically in robust health. I simply wish to ascertain the cause of this… decline. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Pulse is 82 and regular. Blood pressure is 118 over 78. Within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. No acute findings on initial examination. Now, I'd like to check your lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Lymph nodes, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, I have no swelling or discomfort in that area. It seems… rather excessive, given the circumstances. Nevertheless, if you deem it essential, I suppose I shall comply, but I remain skeptical. Do proceed, but gently, if you please.
DOCTOR: No palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions. Alright. I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Also, I want to rule out any possible infection, so I’ll order a urinalysis. We'll also do an erythrocyte sedimentation rate – that can give us some indication if there's inflammation present.
PATIENT: Inflammation? Doctor, are you suggesting I have an… infection? I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. And I’ve had no recent illnesses. I understand the need for thoroughness, but I find your line of questioning rather unsettling. Still, if these tests are necessary to allay your concerns, then proceed. However, I expect a swift resolution to this matter. I have commitments, you understand. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chakka, I am simply being thorough, as any competent physician would. You are presenting with a constellation of symptoms that warrant investigation. The blood work will provide us with more data to determine the underlying cause. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, try to refrain from self-diagnosing based on information you find online. I understand you have commitments, but your health is paramount. If you develop any new or worsening symptoms – fever, chills, severe weight loss, or significant fatigue – you must contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: .
