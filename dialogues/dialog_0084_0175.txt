DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my back, mostly. It’s been really painful lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. And how long has it been painful, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a little over a week ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little ache, but it’s gotten worse each day, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A gradual onset is helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a… a dull ache, most of the time. But if I try to bend over, or twist… oof. That’s when it really hurts. Like a sharp pain that goes right down my back. It’s mostly in my lower back, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, sharp pain with bending or twisting… does that pain radiate anywhere else – down your legs, for instance?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Not all the way down, but I feel it a little bit in my… right hip, mostly. And sometimes a little tingle in my leg, but it doesn’t last long.
DOCTOR: Alright, right hip and occasional tingling in the leg. Has anything specific caused this to start, as far as you know?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I honestly can’t think of anything. I was helping my daughter move some boxes last week, but it wasn’t anything too heavy. Just regular stuff, you know? Maybe that? I don't really remember doing anything else that would have caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay, helping with moving boxes. And are you able to do anything to make the pain better?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps a little bit. And warm showers… those feel good for a while. But it always comes back, even after I rest. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, too, but they don’t seem to do much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Resting and warm showers offer some temporary relief, over-the-counter medications aren’t effective… Do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. Nothing else, that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, probably a couple of years.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure, haven’t been to the doctor recently. And are you currently taking any medications for that or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. The doctor took me off the blood pressure medicine a while back. Said I was doing good enough with just watching what I eat and walking. I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your work and your usual daily activities?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm an Operations Research Analyst – basically, I work with numbers and try to find ways to make things more efficient. It’s mostly desk work, so I sit a lot. I usually walk a bit around the neighborhood in the evenings, but it’s been hard with my back hurting. And I like to help my daughter with things around her house whenever she needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, desk work and some occasional physical activity helping your daughter. Now, before we do a quick examination, let me ask about your family history. Do you have any family members with back problems, arthritis, or any similar issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some trouble with her back when she got older, but I don’t think it was ever diagnosed as anything specific. Just aches and pains, you know? And my grandfather, on my wife's side, had arthritis in his hands, I think. But that’s about it, as far as I know. No one else really had trouble with their backs.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mr. Way. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back to get a better idea of what might be going on. Could you please lie down on your side on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Let me just… Let me know if I need to adjust or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and surrounding muscles. I’ll also have you do a few simple movements to see where the pain is most pronounced. Please let me know immediately if anything causes sharp pain. First, I'm just palpating your lower back. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. A little bit right there… And a little bit to the left of that, too. It’s not horrible, but it’s definitely tender when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about when I ask you to bend forward slightly?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s when it really hurts, Doctor. Right in that same spot. And it shoots down my leg a little bit when I do that. It’s not a bad sharp pain, but it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now if you try to bend backward slightly.
PATIENT: That’s… not as bad as bending forward, but I still feel it in my back. It’s more of a dull ache when I bend this way, but it’s still uncomfortable. It doesn't shoot down my leg like when I bend forward.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now if you can lie flat on your back, and I'm going to lift your leg straight up in the air. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I do this.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead, Doctor. Ooh… yeah, I feel a little tingling down my leg when you lift it up that high. Not horrible, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. Alright. And finally, I'm going to have you try to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Just a normal walk, if you can.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… Oof… yeah, it hurts a little bit when I walk. It’s mostly in my lower back, but I can feel it a little bit in my hip, too. It's like a… a tight feeling. I'm walking a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. Thank you. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by the moving boxes. The pain radiating down your leg and the tingling suggests some possible nerve involvement, but it doesn’t seem severe. I'm not seeing any "red flags" that would indicate a more serious problem, like a fracture or spinal compression. But to be sure, and since the pain hasn’t improved with rest and over-the-counter medications, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray sounds good, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I'd rather be sure than sorry, you know? I'm just hoping it's not something serious. It’s just really been bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Way. We’ll get that X-ray ordered right away. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to rest, avoiding any heavy lifting or twisting, and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. You can also continue with the warm showers if those provide relief. I'm also going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms, and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, to help with the pain and inflammation. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I told you before, no allergies to anything, Doctor. I'm good on that front. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever sounds good. Hopefully, those will help me get some relief. And thank you for taking the time to explain everything. It’s good to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. Alright. I'm prescribing you cyclobenzaprine 10mg, take one tablet at bedtime, as needed for muscle spasms. And ibuprofen 600mg, take two tablets every 6-8 hours, as needed for pain, but don’t exceed six tablets in 24 hours. We'll get the X-ray results back within 24-48 hours. The nurse will call you with the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and adjust the treatment plan if needed. If the pain gets significantly worse, or if you experience any numbness, weakness, or bowel or bladder problems, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Cyclobenzaprine and ibuprofen, got it. And I'll watch out for those warning signs you mentioned. Thank you again for your help. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to review the discharge instructions with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too.
