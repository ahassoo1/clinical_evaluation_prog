DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, pleased to meet you too. Folks said somethin' about... insurance? My wife, she took care of all that stuff. Been a bit since she... well, never mind. It's about gettin' help, I think. For the long haul. I just... don't really remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. We can certainly sort things out together. It sounds like you're seeking ongoing care, and we're happy to provide that. Don’t worry about the insurance details right now; our billing department can assist with that. Let’s focus on you for the moment. When you say “getting help,” could you tell me more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Well... it's just... things ain't as easy as they used to be. I used to be able to do... everything. Work, fixin' stuff around the house, gettin' wood for the stove... now... I get tired real quick. And sometimes I... forget where I put things. Important things. It’s kinda scary, actually. Not like, scared scared, just... worryin'. I don't want to be a burden, you know? My wife always said I was a strong one.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It's completely normal to feel worried when you notice changes like that, and it takes courage to come in and discuss them. It's good you're addressing this now. Changes in energy levels and memory are things we definitely want to investigate. When you say "tired real quick," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well... it's not like just bein' sleepy. It's... like all my batteries are runnin' down. I can be doin' somethin' simple, like washin' dishes, and I just... have to sit. My arms feel heavy, and I just... can't anymore. Even gettin' outta a chair sometimes takes effort. It didn’t used to be like that. I used to work all day, come home and still have energy to chop wood.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite debilitating, Mr. Rover. It's good you’re able to articulate that difference – that’s a very helpful distinction. Feeling that kind of fatigue even with simple tasks is definitely something we need to explore. And you mentioned memory issues... could you give me an example of something you've been forgetting recently?
PATIENT: Umm... let me think. Just the other day, I went to the store for milk and eggs. Got there okay, but I... couldn't remember why I went. Just stood there starin' at the shelves for a good five minutes. Had to call my neighbor, Old Man Hemlock, and he reminded me. He laughed about it, said it happens to the best of us. But... it's kinda embarrassing. And I worry I'll forget somethin' really important.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that would be worrying, Mr. Rover. And it’s very common for memory to be affected by a number of things. Please don’t feel embarrassed; these details are important for me to understand what’s going on. Old Man Hemlock sounds like a good neighbor. Now, besides the fatigue and memory issues, have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I... I get kinda grumpy sometimes. Not mean, just... short with folks. My wife, she used to say I had a sunny disposition. Now... I don't feel like doin' much. Used to enjoy fishin', workin' on my boat. Now... it just feels like a bother. And... sometimes I feel kinda... off. Like I'm not really here, you know? Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Rover. Those all sound like important changes – the mood shifts, the loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, and that feeling of being “not really here.” It sounds like you're experiencing a constellation of symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well... I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And... uh... the doctor said somethin' about my blood pressure bein' a little high a few years back. Put me on some pills, but I didn't like 'em. Made me feel dizzy. Stopped takin' 'em after a while. Aside from that... nothin' much. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. Tough Aleut stock, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Rover. And yes, strong stock can certainly make a difference. So, to clarify, you had your appendix removed in childhood and were briefly treated for high blood pressure, but you’re not currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: That's right. No pills now. Just try to take it easy. And... I try to eat right. Fish mostly. And... sometimes I have a little bit of whiskey. Just to help me sleep. My wife used to let me have a little one, too.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Rover. It's important for me to have a complete picture. Just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications or have any other sensitivities?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin'. I've had a few scrapes and bruises in my time, workin' on the boats and such, but nothin' serious enough to need... fancy medicines. Mostly just used bandages and a bit of saltwater.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Umm... my mom, she lived to be pretty old. Ninety-something, I think. My dad... he didn't live as long. Had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. I had an aunt... on my mother's side... she got kinda... confused towards the end. The family said it was her mind goin'. But that was a long time ago, and I didn't really know her that well.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rover. That information is helpful. So, your mother had a long life, your father had a heart attack in his sixties, and your aunt experienced some cognitive decline later in life. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just... try to be gentle, alright? My bones ain't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. We will be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, that’s 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me… Everything sounds clear, but I do notice a slightly irregular rhythm. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age, and your balance is a little unsteady. I'm also going to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to check your memory and thinking skills. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Umm... today is... August... the second? Is it? Yeah, August the second. I think. 2025, right? My mind's been a bit foggy lately. It feels like I gotta really think about simple things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Rover. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling information, especially if you’re feeling tired or stressed. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. I’ll say them once, and then ask you to recall them after I ask you a few other questions. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them. Okay, now can you tell me what year is it?
PATIENT: Two thousand and twenty-five. Like I said. It's August, the second. I just... hope I don't forget what I had for breakfast. Now... what were those words again? Oh dear. This is embarassin'.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Rover. Don’t worry about it. Memory can fluctuate. You correctly recalled the year. Now, let's try to recall the three words. Do you remember any of them?
PATIENT: Umm... apple? I think I remember apple. And... somethin' about wood? Was table one of them? I'm really tryin', Doctor. It's just... they're kinda floatin' around in my head, like fish in the ocean. Hard to grab onto 'em.
DOCTOR: You correctly recalled apple, and you remembered that one of the words was associated with wood - which is good, as table was another one. This is helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the physical and brief cognitive examination, there are several possibilities we need to investigate further. Your symptoms – fatigue, memory issues, mood changes, and irregular heart rhythm – could be due to a variety of factors, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, early stages of cognitive impairment, or even depression. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. I’d also like to recommend an EKG to further evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's goin' on with my head. And my batteries. Just feelin' tired all the time… it's no way to live. So, blood tests and... uh... EKG? Is that the thing with the stickers on my chest?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The EKG involves placing stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It's a painless and quick procedure. And you're absolutely right, we need to figure out what's going on with your energy levels and your mind. I’ll write you a referral to the lab for the blood tests and schedule you for an EKG next week. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a few lifestyle changes that might help. Try to get regular, moderate exercise – even a short walk each day can make a difference. Ensure you're getting enough sleep, and focus on eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Do you have any questions about these recommendations, or about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Walkin', sleepin', and eatin' right. Sounds easy enough, but it's kinda hard when you feel tired all the time. But I'll try, Doctor. I promise. Um... will the tests tell me for sure what's wrong? And... if it is somethin' bad... what happens then? I don't want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Rover. The tests will provide us with valuable information and help us narrow down the possibilities. It's unlikely they will give us a definitive answer immediately, but they will give us a starting point. If the tests reveal an underlying medical condition, we will discuss the best course of treatment. If we suspect early stages of cognitive impairment, we can discuss further evaluation and support options. There are many resources available, and you would not be alone in this. And please, don't worry about being a burden. That’s my job - to help you navigate this, and we will do it together. Your wife, or other family members, can also be involved in the process, if you wish. We have social workers who can assist with support and resources as well. I’ll give you the lab requisition and the appointment information for the EKG. Do you have any concerns about getting to the appointments?
PATIENT: Old Man Hemlock, he usually gives me a ride. He's a good neighbor. Always lookin' out for me. I guess... that's all my questions for now, Doctor. Just... thank you. For listenin' and not laughin' at me. It's kinda scary, forgettin' things and feelin' tired all the time. I appreciate you takin' the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. And please, there is absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed or ashamed. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I commend you for doing so. Old Man Hemlock sounds like a wonderful neighbor - it's good to have supportive people around you. I will review the results of your tests as soon as they come in and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s the paperwork, and please, take care of yourself. I'll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. Have a good day, and take it easy. .
