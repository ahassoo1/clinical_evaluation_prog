DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor. It's... well, I just moved here, see? And I need to... get things set up, I guess. Like, with a doctor and all. It's a social thing, I think? My... someone told me I had to come. I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: I see. A…social requirement. Well, establishing care with a primary physician is certainly a responsible thing to do, even if prompted by others. Let’s try to make this productive, then. Perhaps we can use this time to get a baseline understanding of your health. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you think it's important to have a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, um... important? I guess… so you know if something’s wrong? Like, if I get sick or… break something? My grandma always had a doctor. She said it was good to have someone to… check things. I don’t really feel wrong right now, though. Just… new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Preventative care is certainly valuable, even if you're currently feeling well. It's good that your grandmother instilled that in you. To get a better picture, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… I… don't think so? Maybe when I was little? I had… ears? They hurt sometimes. But I don't remember a diagnosis. Does that make sense? Like, they just… fixed it. And… I think I had chickenpox? Everyone got chickenpox when I was a kid. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Ear infections are common in childhood. Chickenpox, as well. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. And I don't think I’ve been to the hospital. Ever? Unless… when I was born? But I don’t remember that, obviously. I just… don't think so. Is that okay? Am I supposed to remember all this stuff?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Bonck. Most people don’t memorize their medical history. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… My… my mom’s side? Grandma… she had… something with her heart, I think. But she lived a really long time! And… my dad’s side… I don’t know. I didn’t… I didn’t see my dad’s side very much. They live… far away? I really don't know much about their health, sorry. It’s kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history can be difficult to ascertain, especially with limited contact. Let's move on to your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, no. Never. My grandma wouldn’t allow it. And… I just don’t. I work with machines all day, so… I need to be clear-headed. And... it just doesn't seem like a good idea. Does that make sense? I don't really go out much, either. Mostly just work and… home.
DOCTOR: Very good. A healthy lifestyle is commendable. Now, regarding allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so? I’ve eaten everything my grandma made, and she's a really good cook! So… probably not food. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything. I get itchy sometimes, but… that's just the weather, I think? I'm not sure. I honestly don’t remember ever having a reaction to anything. Is that helpful? It feels like I should know this stuff.
DOCTOR: It's alright to not have a perfect recall of your medical history, Ms. Bonck. We're getting there. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I just… take whatever my grandma tells me to, like, drink water and get enough sleep. She’s really good at keeping me healthy. But no pills or anything. I don’t like taking pills. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Bonck, it seems we’ve established that you have a limited medical history, which is…not uncommon. Given your age and reported health, a basic physical examination would be prudent. It's simply a way to get a baseline assessment. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A… a check-up? Like, you listen to my heart and stuff? Yeah. That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work later. But… yeah. Okay. That sounds good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat on the table, and we'll begin. I'll need you to put on this gown. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then we'll move on to a general physical assessment.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Is… is it cold in there? I get cold easily. It's just… I don't usually wear things like this. But… okay. I'll do it.
DOCTOR: It's room temperature, Ms. Bonck. Nothing to be concerned about. Just take your time. Once you’re ready, please lie back on the table. We'll start with auscultating your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Um… okay. I think I’m ready. It's… kinda cold. But okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, Ms. Bonck. Deep breaths. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Murmurs auscultated - none. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. TMs are clear bilaterally. Some cerumen present, but not obstructive. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender.
