DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Batara. It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom, you see. It’s not… easy, lately. It takes me a while, and sometimes it just… doesn’t happen all at once, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with bowel movements. How long has this been going on, Mrs. Yadao?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not my bowels, Doctor. It's… when I pee. Sorry, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about. But it’s been happening for… oh, maybe three weeks now, I’d say. Started gradually, but it’s gotten worse over the past week.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. Alright. So, difficulty with urination. And you said it’s gotten worse recently. Can you describe how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: Well, it just… takes effort. Like I have to push. And it doesn’t come out in a strong stream, you know? It’s more… dribbly. And sometimes, after I think I’m finished, a little bit more comes out. It’s very annoying, honestly. And I find myself going more often, even if I don’t really need to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Difficulty initiating the stream, weak stream, dribbling, and increased frequency. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. It’s just… frustrating. And a little worrying, to be honest. I don’t want something seriously wrong, you know? I'm usually very regular, everything works just fine, so this is… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. It looks about the same as always, I suppose. Clear-ish, you know? Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink plenty of water, so I figured that was just because of that. The smell… no, I haven’t noticed anything different. Honestly, I don’t usually pay that much attention to it. Is that bad? I should be paying attention, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's not bad that you don't scrutinize every detail, Mrs. Yadao. But it’s good you’re telling me these things now. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too serious, just aches and pains. And the doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high, so I take a pill for that every day. Losartan, I think it’s called. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Is that everything? I think so. I try to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis, hypertension… Losartan, yes. Pneumonia. Alright. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I had a difficult pregnancy with my son, but it was a long time ago, and everything went smoothly in the end. No C-section or anything like that. I try to avoid hospitals as much as possible, if I’m honest. They always smell so… sterile, and it reminds me of bad things. I prefer to stay healthy and avoid them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit complicated. My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had problems with his heart. He passed away when he was fairly young, from a heart attack. And my brother, he had… prostate trouble, I think. He always complained about it when he got older. But that was a man’s problem, of course. Doesn't really apply to me, does it?
DOCTOR: Family history of diabetes, heart disease, and prostate issues… it’s all relevant, Mrs. Yadao. Even prostate issues can give us clues. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, you’re right, of course. Sorry, I didn’t mean to be dismissive. It’s just… a bit embarrassing to talk about all these things. Allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I eat everything, really. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. And I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, for headaches and aches and pains, and never had a problem. I’m quite lucky, I suppose. Unless you count being a bit forgetful, but I don't think that’s an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and it was terrible. Always coughing, always smelled awful. I swore I’d never start, and I never did. I like fresh air, you know? And I try to stay healthy. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. I don’t drink every day, not at all. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. It helps me relax, you know? And I don’t drink to excess, never have. Just a nice little glass with my meal. It's not like I'm a… a heavy drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take Losartan for my blood pressure, like I said. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep healthy. And sometimes, when my knees are really aching, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, nothing prescribed. That’s it, I think. Just those three things. I try not to take too many pills, you know? I don’t want to be dependent on them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Losartan, multivitamin, ibuprofen. Now, Mrs. Yadao, I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m honest, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Then I'll need to examine your abdomen. And finally, a quick neurological check. Please let me know if you feel any pain during the examination.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… be gentle, please. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And I get a bit… nervous, with doctors. It’s silly, I know, but… Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation. No masses appreciated. Tympanic throughout. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No focal neurological deficits noted. I’m going to need to do a quick urine test now. I’ll leave you some privacy to do that. There’s a cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample. I’ll be right outside when you're finished.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A urine test. Right. Mid-stream… yes, I remember that. It’s been a while since I had one of those. Alright. I’ll… I’ll go do that now. Just let me know if you need anything. It’s a bit chilly in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Take your time. I’ll be right outside.
PATIENT:
