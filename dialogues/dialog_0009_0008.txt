DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right, well… it’s my ears. They feel… full. Like something’s blocking them. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Honestly, time gets away from me. Is that… is that what you needed to know? I just want to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fullness” in the ears, and it’s been going on for a while. That’s a good starting point. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Oh, goodness. Maybe… six months? Perhaps longer. It came on gradually, I think. Not suddenly. I honestly can’t put a precise date on it, Doctor. It's just... been there. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help. Gradual onset over six months is useful information. And is the fullness in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Yes, both ears feel… blocked. Not equally, perhaps. One feels a little worse than the other, but it's definitely both. I haven't really… paid that much attention, to be honest. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears, with one possibly a little more affected than the other. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I’m a bit hard of hearing anyway, you know, getting older. But this is… different. It’s not just the usual trouble hearing things. No pain, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just… the fullness. And maybe a little bit of… ringing, sometimes. But it’s faint. I’m not even sure if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no dizziness. You've noticed some ringing in your ears – tinnitus – and you feel it might be related. When you hear the ringing, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. It’s not… a loud ringing, more like a… a high-pitched whine, sometimes. It doesn’t bother me too much, usually. It's just… there. When I’m quiet, maybe. Or when I’m… stressed. I don’t remember exactly when it happens, honestly. It's hard to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent tinnitus, often associated with quiet or stress. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. Well, my wife… she passed away a few years back. I’m widowed. And I get the usual aches and pains, you know, for a man my age. I've got private insurance, I think. Other than that… nothing major, as far as I know. I used to work with a lot of chemicals on the farm, but that was years ago. I don't really remember any specific illnesses or anything. Does that… help? It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Widowed a few years ago, some aches and pains. And a history of working with chemicals on the farm – that's good information to have. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had any bad reactions to any drugs in the past?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. No, I don’t think so. I've never really had any problems with medication. I take a little something for my blood pressure now and then, but that’s it. Nothing serious. And no bad reactions, as far as I can recall. I’m not a big fan of taking pills, so I try to avoid them when I can. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. I hope I'm not being a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a bother at all. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details, and I appreciate you sharing what you can. You take something for your blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Uh… I really wish I could tell you. It’s… a white pill, I think. Small, round. My wife used to handle all the medication stuff. She’d fill the little boxes every week. I just… took them when she told me to. I haven't a clue what it's called, I'm afraid. Sorry. I really am hopeless with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can try to look that up later, if you're comfortable with that. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope to see what’s going on. It won’t hurt a bit. Just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… Relax… yes, okay. Just… be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I don’t really like things going in my ears. But… if you think it’s necessary. Go ahead. Just… let me know when you’re done.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your left ear now… I see a little bit of cerumen, or earwax, present, but nothing significant. The ear drum itself appears intact, but it's slightly… dull in color. Now the right ear… Similar findings – some cerumen, and the ear drum also looks a bit dull. There’s no obvious sign of infection or fluid, but both ear drums don’t appear to be moving as freely as they should. Both ear drums appear slightly stiff. This could be contributing to the fullness you’re experiencing. The cerumen might also be playing a role.
PATIENT: Stiff… Stiff? Is that… bad? I don't like the sound of "stiff". What does that mean? And the… cerumen? Is that something I need to worry about? I just want to get this sorted, you know? I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: No, "stiff" doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it can contribute to the feeling of fullness and difficulty hearing. Think of the ear drum like a drumhead – it needs to vibrate freely to transmit sound properly. When it's a little stiff, it doesn’t move as easily. Cerumen, or earwax, is a natural substance that protects the ear canal, but if too much builds up, it can block sound and cause discomfort. I don’t think there's anything to be overly alarmed about at this point. The most likely cause of your symptoms is a combination of cerumen impaction and some slight stiffness in the ear drums. We can try a simple earwax removal procedure, and I’ll recommend some over-the-counter drops to help soften the wax and improve the flexibility of the ear drums.
PATIENT: Over-the-counter drops… that sounds… manageable. Not surgery or anything like that? Just… drops? That’s good. Yes, that’s very good. And it'll help with the… fullness? And maybe the ringing? If it's all connected, that is. I suppose I should get those drops, then. Is there anything else I need to know? Or… can I go get them now? I’m not good at remembering things, so I need to get it done quickly.
DOCTOR: No surgery is needed, thankfully. Just the over-the-counter drops. They should help soften the wax and improve the flexibility of the ear drums, which could alleviate the fullness and potentially reduce the ringing as well, if it's related to the blockage. Here’s a note for the drops – they contain carbamide peroxide. Use them as directed on the packaging – usually a few drops in each ear twice a day for a few days. You may hear some bubbling, which is normal. And avoid putting anything in your ears, like cotton swabs, as that can push the wax further in. I’m also going to recommend you follow up with me in about two weeks to see if the drops have helped. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they get worse, we can discuss further options. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, I can remember that. Carbamide… peroxide. Right. And no cotton swabs. I always thought they were a good idea, but my wife always told me not to. She was a sensible woman. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… drops, twice a day, for two weeks. And follow up with you. Is that everything? I just want to make sure I've got it right. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It's… reassuring. I suppose I’ll be on my way, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ve got it perfectly. Drops twice a day for two weeks, and then a follow-up appointment with me. And you're very welcome. I'm glad I could reassure you. If you experience any sudden pain, hearing loss, or dizziness, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic right away. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Have a good day, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez.
