DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… Fazzina, yes? It’s nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It’s been… a little while now. I don’t remember exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Yes, Fazzina. And it’s alright, don't worry about the exact timing. “A little while” is fine to start with. Sinus pressure… okay. Can you describe the pressure a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… full. Like something is blocking it, you know? Mostly… here, <points to forehead and cheeks> and maybe a little bit behind my eyes. Not… pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And stuffy. Very stuffy. It makes it hard to… breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness, mostly in your forehead and cheeks, some behind your eyes. Not pain, more uncomfortable and stuffy, making it hard to breathe. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the stuffiness?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? <pauses, thinking> Let me see… sometimes my head… feels a little bit heavy. Like… after a long day. And I think… maybe a little bit of a cough? Not a bad cough. Just… a tickle in my throat. Oh! And… sometimes I smell things that aren’t there. Just… little smells. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness in the head, a mild cough, and… you've smelled things that aren’t there?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's strange. Like… sometimes I smell something sweet, or… like something burning. But nothing is burning. My husband… he doesn’t smell it. He says I’m imagining things. It doesn’t happen all the time, though. Just… sometimes. It’s a little scary, to be honest. I… don't know what it means.
DOCTOR: I understand why that would be concerning, Mikeisha. It's good you mentioned it. Let's not dismiss anything. Now, have you had a fever, any facial pain when you touch your face, or any colored mucus when you blow your nose?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. My husband would know, I guess. Facial pain… not really. Sometimes a little bit… tender, maybe, when I press here, <touches sides of nose>, but not… pain. Mucus… yes. Sometimes it’s… yellow. Not always. Sometimes clear. But… often yellow. Is that… bad? I’m sorry, I don’t know these things.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It's my job to ask and to understand. Yellow mucus can sometimes indicate an infection, but it's not always a definitive sign. Now, just to get a better picture, have you been experiencing any changes in your sense of taste, or any pain in your teeth?
PATIENT: Taste… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Everything tastes… normal. Maybe a little bit less strong? But I thought that was just… because I’m getting older. <chuckles softly> And teeth… no, no pain in my teeth. I go to the dentist… when I can. It’s expensive, you know? But no tooth pain with this. Just… the sinuses. The stuffiness. And the smells. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Confusing is understandable. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your lungs, look in your ears and nose, and gently feel around your sinuses. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I… trust you. Just… please be gentle. And… tell me if you see anything wrong. I… I worry a lot. Especially when I don't understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. I will be as gentle as possible. And I will explain everything I see, step-by-step. <gestures towards the examination table> If you could just sit up here for me, please. First, I'll listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now another one…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <sits up on the examination table> Deep breaths… I can do that. <takes a slow, deep breath, then exhales slowly> Is that okay? Am I doing it right? I… sometimes feel short of breath, even when I’m just sitting here. But maybe that’s just… nerves.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Your breathing sounds… clear, thankfully. No wheezing or crackling that’s immediately concerning. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. <gently inserts otoscope into the patient’s ear canal> Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. No sign of infection there. Now, I’m going to take a look inside your nose. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it is. <gently inserts nasal speculum into the patient’s nose, using a penlight to illuminate the nasal passages> Your nasal passages are a little swollen and inflamed, and there’s some yellow mucus present, as you mentioned. No obvious polyps or other abnormalities. Palpating your sinuses… <gently presses on the patient’s forehead and cheeks> …there’s some tenderness here, over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. But nothing too severe.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn't so bad. A little… strange, but not painful. So… swollen sinuses? And yellow mucus? Is that… what’s causing the smells? And the stuffiness? I… I just want to feel normal again. My husband… he worries too. He says I need to take care of myself. But it's hard, you know? Everything is so expensive. And I… I don't know where to start. <fidgets with her hands>
DOCTOR: I understand, Mikeisha. It sounds like you’re likely dealing with sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses. The swollen nasal passages and mucus are definitely contributing to the stuffiness, and the tenderness you’re feeling. As for the smells… it’s less common, but sometimes inflammation can affect your sense of smell. It's something we need to keep an eye on. Given your symptoms, I think a likely cause is a viral or bacterial infection. To be sure, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection. And perhaps a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better look at the inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. <pauses> I know you mentioned cost concerns… we can discuss options if the CT scan is something you’re worried about. There may be less expensive alternatives, although they won't give us as much information.
PATIENT: A blood test… okay. And… a CT scan? That sounds expensive. <frowns> My husband… he’s already working two jobs. A CT scan… I don’t know, Doctor. Maybe… maybe we could just try some medicine first? Something for the stuffiness? And… something for the smells? If it doesn't get better, then we can talk about the scan? I… I don’t want to put too much burden on my husband. He’s already doing so much. <looks down at her hands again>
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mikeisha. We can absolutely start with medication and see how you respond. It's important to be mindful of the financial burden. We can try a nasal saline rinse to help clear the congestion, and I can prescribe a decongestant to help reduce the swelling. We can also consider a course of antibiotics, although given the lack of a high fever, it's possible a viral infection is the cause, and antibiotics won’t be effective in that case. I’ll write you prescriptions for both a decongestant and a saline nasal spray. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, we’ll revisit the possibility of a CT scan. In the meantime, if you develop a high fever, severe headache, or any vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. Medicine first. And then… we’ll see. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. And… for not pushing the scan right away. <smiles weakly> I… I feel a little bit better just knowing there’s something we can do. <pauses> And… the saline rinse? How do I do that? I’ve never done that before.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. It’s my job to work with you and find a plan that feels comfortable. The saline rinse is quite simple. You can purchase a saline rinse kit at most pharmacies. It comes with a bottle and packets of saline powder. You mix the powder with warm, distilled water – very important to use distilled water – and then gently flush the saline solution through your nasal passages. There are plenty of videos online that demonstrate how to do it properly, if you'd like a visual guide. It can feel a little strange at first, but it’s very effective at clearing congestion and reducing inflammation. Here, I’ve printed out some instructions for you. It also includes information on potential side effects, although they're usually mild. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. You’ve been very helpful. And… very kind. Thank you again. <takes the handout> I’ll… I’ll try the saline rinse. And I’ll watch the videos. <smiles a little brighter> Maybe… maybe I’ll start feeling better soon. Thank you. <starts to slowly gather her belongings>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I have a good feeling you will. Remember to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Here’s a card with my office number and a link to our online patient portal. Please, don’t be a stranger. Have a good day, Mikeisha. And take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Fazzina. You too. <offers a small wave and exits the office> .
