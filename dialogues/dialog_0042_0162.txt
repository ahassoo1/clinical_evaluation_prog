DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It’s my stomach. It’s… bloated. Always bloated. Honestly, it’s been going on for… a while. I don’t really keep track of these things. It’s just annoying, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It is frustrating when something persistent like that is disrupting your day. "Bloated" is a good starting point. When you say "a while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Jeez. Months, I guess. Maybe… six months? Look, I told you, I don’t pay attention to dates. It just… started feeling puffy, you know? And it hasn’t gone away. It's not like it's painful, just… uncomfortable. And embarrassing, if I’m being honest. You ever just feel like a balloon? That’s me, pretty much all the time now.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, and I apologize for pressing for a specific timeframe. Six months is helpful, though. And yes, I can imagine how uncomfortable and frustrating that would be. So, it’s been consistently present for about six months – not painful, but uncomfortable and noticeable. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything makes it worse. Eating, drinking, sitting, standing... breathing, probably. I don't know. Honestly, I haven't really tried to pinpoint it. What’s the point? It’s always there. I eat normal stuff, you know? Burgers, fries… sometimes I’ll have rice. It doesn't really matter what it is. Though, I guess… maybe beans? Yeah, beans are bad. But I like beans. Is that… relevant? Look, just tell me what's wrong with me already. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Kristofik, thank you for telling me. Any patterns, even if they seem small, can be helpful. So, beans seem to exacerbate the bloating. And it sounds like it’s pretty consistent regardless of what you’re doing, but perhaps slightly worse with certain foods. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Ugh. Let me think. I get… gassy. Obviously. It’s bloating, right? What else is gonna happen? Sometimes my stomach just… rumbles. A lot. It’s embarrassing when I’m out to eat. People look at you funny. And… I guess I’m tired a lot. But honestly, who isn’t tired? I work hard. Pile driving isn’t exactly a relaxing job. I don’t know if that’s related, though. This is pointless. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Kristofik. Every bit of information is helpful. So, you've mentioned gas, rumbling, and increased fatigue. Fatigue is definitely something we should consider. And you're right to mention your work – pile driving is physically demanding. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What do you want me to say? I go to the bathroom. Look, I'm not gonna get into the details of my… you know. It’s normal. Sometimes a little loose, sometimes a little… not. Depends. Like everything else. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came in for a bloated stomach, not a colonoscopy. Can’t you just give me something for the gas? Something to make it stop puffing up?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. I want to assure you I’m not pushing for a colonoscopy without reason. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of what’s going on. You mentioned changes in your bowel habits - sometimes loose, sometimes not. Has there been any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I haven't been weighing myself, obviously. Blood? No! Look, I'm a pile driver, not a… I don’t check my stool for blood. That's… gross. This is getting really intrusive, Doc. I came here because my stomach feels like a balloon, not for a full physical exam. Can we please just focus on that? Seriously. I'm starting to regret coming in here. Just give me something for the gas and let me go. This is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. That was not my intention. I want to help you, and to do that, I need to rule out anything serious. However, I respect your wishes, and we can certainly focus on symptom management. Before we proceed, I want to explain why I’ve been asking these questions. Persistent bloating and gas, accompanied by changes in bowel habits, could be related to something as simple as dietary sensitivities. But it's important to rule out other possibilities. To start, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination of your abdomen. I'll listen to your bowel sounds and gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright?
