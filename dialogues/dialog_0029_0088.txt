DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. It’s Jaylyne, by the way. Just Jaylyne is fine. Um, it’s my ears. Been hearing this…ringing sound. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to get on my nerves, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne. Ringing in the ears, you said. And how long exactly is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… about three weeks, maybe a month? It started off quiet, like a really faint whistle after a concert, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s gotten louder. It's pretty constant now.
DOCTOR: Constant, alright. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Both, actually. It’s not super loud in either, but it’s definitely there. It’s hard to explain… it’s like a high-pitched ringing, but sometimes it feels more like buzzing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. Buzzing and ringing… okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Quiet rooms make it worse, believe it or not. Like, if it’s totally silent, I can really hear it. And… maybe when I’m stressed? Work’s been a bit hectic lately, running around with orders and customers. It seems to get louder then, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so quiet environments and stress seem to be triggers. Have you had any recent changes in your hearing – any difficulty hearing conversations, or needing to turn up the volume on things?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing seems okay. I haven't noticed anything different with conversations or the TV. It’s just… the ringing is there, constantly. It's distracting, more than anything. I just want it to stop, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been exposed to any loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Um… not that I can think of. Work gets noisy, with the chatter and music, but nothing super loud. Oh! There was a wedding a few weeks back, and the band was pretty loud for a bit, but that was before the ringing started, I think. I wasn’t right next to them or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Any dizziness, nausea, or problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No dizziness or anything like that. Balance is fine. Just the ringing, that’s all. I’m pretty steady on my feet, running around with trays all day, you know? I’d notice if I was feeling off balance.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, any pain in your ears, or any discharge?
PATIENT: No pain, and definitely no discharge. Just… the sound. It's not hurting, just annoying. Really annoying. I just want to get to the bottom of it so I can get back to normal, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. And… no, nothing major. Just, um… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I'm divorced, if that matters? I don't have any ongoing health problems, Doc. I try to stay healthy, you know? Running around at work keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, like Panadol, but that’s it. Nothing regular, I promise. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, let's do a quick exam. I'm just going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we'll do a quick hearing test to see if we can pinpoint anything. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just want to get this sorted, if possible. Let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight redness in the ear canal, but nothing major. Same on this side. Tympanic membranes look intact. Now, I'm going to do a quick tuning fork test, and then a whisper test to get a better idea of your hearing. Alright. Whisper test is… slightly diminished on both sides, but not drastically. So, the hearing is not severely affected. It seems like this is likely a case of tinnitus. It’s common, especially with some stress and noise exposure. It doesn’t always have a clear cause.
PATIENT: Tinnitus? Is that… serious? Like, am I going to go deaf? I just want to make sure it's not something bad. And what can we do about it? It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not usually serious, and it rarely leads to deafness. It’s more of an annoyance, a perception of sound when there isn’t an external sound. We’ve ruled out any major blockage or infection, and your hearing seems relatively normal. There’s often no specific “cure” for tinnitus, unfortunately. However, there are things we can do to manage it. We can explore some strategies like sound therapy – using white noise or relaxing music to mask the ringing – and stress management techniques. Sometimes, a course of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, can also be helpful. It helps you learn to cope with the perception of the sound. I’m also going to recommend a vitamin B12 supplement. There's some evidence that a deficiency can contribute to tinnitus. Would you be interested in discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… a bit of a relief, to be honest. Not deafness, that’s good. Sound therapy sounds… okay. I listen to music anyway. Stress management… yeah, work’s been hectic. I could definitely use some help with that. Vitamin B12? I don't think I've ever taken that before. What does that even do? And what about the CBT? What does that involve?
DOCTOR: Vitamin B12 is important for nerve function, and as I said, some studies show a link between deficiency and tinnitus. It's a relatively harmless supplement to try. It comes in pill form, and you take it daily. As for CBT, it’s a type of therapy that helps you change the way you think about the tinnitus. It doesn’t make the sound go away, but it helps you learn to cope with it better. It involves talking with a therapist about your feelings and anxieties related to the ringing, and learning techniques to manage them. We can write you a referral to a local therapist who specializes in tinnitus. It usually involves a series of sessions. I can also recommend some apps and websites with sound therapy options you can explore. Do either of those options sound appealing to you at this point?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think I’d be willing to try the vitamin B12. Can't hurt, right? And maybe the apps. I'm not sure about talking to a therapist just yet. I'm not really one for sharing my feelings, if you know what I mean. But apps and the vitamin sounds like a good place to start. What kind of apps are we talking about? And is the B12 something I need a prescription for?
DOCTOR: Alright, B12 doesn’t require a prescription. You can pick it up over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Just a standard multivitamin with B12 is fine, or a dedicated B12 supplement. As for the apps, there are quite a few. “White Noise Lite” is a popular one, and “Relax Melodies” has a variety of soothing sounds and guided meditations. There’s also “Tinnitus HQ”, which is specifically designed for tinnitus management. We can write down a few recommendations for you. They all work by playing sounds to distract your brain from the ringing, and some allow you to create personalized soundscapes. I’m going to write a prescription for a multivitamin with a good dosage of B12. I’ll also print out a list of those app recommendations and a pamphlet on tinnitus management. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you're doing with these strategies. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, a month sounds good. That gives me time to try everything out. Thank you, Doc. You've been really helpful. I feel a bit better just knowing there's something I can do about it. Hopefully, this will get it under control.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, managing tinnitus often takes time and experimentation. Here are those recommendations, and the prescription. Take care, and I'll see you in a month.
