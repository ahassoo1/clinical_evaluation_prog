DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. It’s in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too. It makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness, getting progressively worse, primarily in your legs, but sometimes in your arms as well. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it started… maybe six months ago? Small things. I’d stumble a little more often. Now… now I need a cane to walk sometimes. And holding things… like a cup of coffee… it’s not as steady as it used to be. It just… gives way, you know? Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Right, six months ago it started subtly, with stumbling, and has progressed to needing a cane and noticing weakness when holding things. Okay. Is the weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days are better than others. Hard to say why, though. Sometimes I think it’s worse when I’m tired, but not always. And… it’s not pain, exactly. More like… heavy. Like trying to lift something very, very heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy, not painful, and fluctuating, sometimes worse with fatigue. Alright. And is this weakness isolated to your legs and arms, or have you noticed it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… sometimes my balance feels off. Not falling, but… wobbly. And I get tired easier, even when I haven't done much. My… my words sometimes get stuck, too. Not often, but my wife says she notices it. It’s like… I know what I want to say, but it takes a little longer to come out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’ve got fluctuating weakness in legs and arms, imbalance, increased fatigue, and some difficulty finding the right words occasionally. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision, swallowing, or bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Vision… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always figured that was just getting old! Swallowing… no trouble there. And… no, everything is regular with that, thankfully. I’m glad you ask, though. It’s good to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… years ago, I had a bad knee from football. Had surgery, but that’s all fixed now. And… oh. I was diagnosed with… multiple sclerosis, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? I don’t remember all the details, to be honest. The doctor then said it was… mild. I haven't seen a specialist for it since then. Mostly just… tried to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of knee surgery and a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis about 20 years ago, which was described as mild and hasn't been followed up with a specialist. That's very important information, thank you. Do you know what medications you were on for the MS at the time, or are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: I… I don't remember the name of the medicine. Little blue pills, I think? It was a long time ago. And right now… just a little something for my blood pressure. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sun. That's all. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just medication for blood pressure and vitamin D. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife keeps track of all that, mostly. I get confused easily with those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of neurological conditions, muscle weakness, or anything similar in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had arthritis bad, towards the end. And my sister… she had some problems with her balance when she got older, but I don’t know if it was anything like this. No one else, not that I remember. We didn’t really talk about health much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and some balance issues in your sister. Alright. And finally, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well… I’m retired now, used to be an athletic trainer, as you know. I live with my wife, we’ve been married for… oh, goodness, over 50 years! I used to be very active, played a lot of golf, but… it’s getting harder now with the legs. I try to walk when I can, but not as much as I’d like. I enjoy gardening, that's mostly sitting, though. And… I drink a little wine with dinner, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Retired athletic trainer, married for over 50 years, some activity with walking and gardening, and occasional wine with dinner. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and balance. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, things don’t move as easy as they used to!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore, just walk slowly across the room for me, like you normally would. Okay, and now I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Strength is 4 out of 5 in your arms and legs, a little weaker in the ankles, with reflexes are normal. Your balance is a little unsteady. I'm also noting some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed. Now, given your history of multiple sclerosis, the progressive weakness, and these exam findings, it's likely that we're seeing a flare-up of your MS. However, it's important to rule out other possible causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or other neurological conditions. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a vitamin B12 level and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… goodness. Sounds serious. But… yes, alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it. A flare-up… that’s what you think it is? I don’t remember having flare-ups before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We will get those tests ordered right away. And yes, a flare-up is what I suspect, but it's been a long time since you were actively managed for MS, so it’s important to get a clear picture. Some people experience flare-ups and remissions, and sometimes they can be mild, other times they can be more significant. We need to see what’s happening now. Okay, I'm ordering the blood tests now. And I'll get the order for the MRI sent to the radiology department. They'll call you to schedule it. It’s important to get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. If you notice any new symptoms, such as vision changes, difficulty speaking, or bowel or bladder problems, please call the office immediately. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests as soon as they’re available. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Rest, avoid activity… and watch for those other things. I can do that. Thank you. It’s… it’s good to have someone looking into this again. It’s been a long time. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this and figure out the best course of action. Before you go, I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist. They specialize in MS and can provide more comprehensive management. Would you like me to suggest someone local?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I don’t know where to start looking. Someone you recommend would be wonderful. I'm trusting you to find a good one, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, here you go. This is a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's a highly-regarded neurologist who specializes in multiple sclerosis and is located just a few miles from here. Her office number is on the referral. I’ve also included some information about MS on this sheet for you to read while you wait for your appointment. Please call her office as soon as possible to schedule. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Dr. Vance… I’ll call them tomorrow. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease, even if it’s just a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Vance. Take care, and get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
