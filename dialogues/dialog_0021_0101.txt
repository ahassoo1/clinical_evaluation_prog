DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It's this headache, see? Right at the back of mi head. Been botherin' mi for a little while now. Not constant, but when it comes on, it's a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: A headache, yes. Plenty of people get headaches. “A little while now” isn’t terribly helpful, though. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, you're right. Sorry 'bout that. Let me think... it started maybe… three weeks ago? Around the middle of July, I'd say. It comes and goes, like waves, you know? Some days I don't feel a thing, and others...others it’s a proper throbbin' pain. Worse when I'm bendin' over, I noticed that. Like when I'm doin' someone’s toenails, it really flares up. I’m a manicurist, see? I gotta lean over a lot.
DOCTOR: A manicurist. Right. And this throbbing… where exactly is it?
PATIENT: Well, if you put your hand like this… …right here, at the very back. Sometimes it feels like it’s spreadin' a bit, up the sides, but mostly right here. Feels like a tight band squeezin' mi head, sometimes. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… dull and achin'. Not the worst pain I've ever had, but it's persistent, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Persistent. Alright. And have you noticed anything else along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, nothin’ major. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m 87, Doctor! I expect a bit of tiredness. I haven't been seein' any spots or blurry vision, no fever, nothin' like that. I just feel… off, when it's bad. A bit shaky, like mi legs are weak, but that could just be old age too, I suppose. I haven't bumped mi head or anything like that, neither.
DOCTOR: Shaky… and when does this shakiness occur?
PATIENT: Mostly when the headache is at its worst, Doctor. Like, if I'm leanin' over workin', and the pain really kicks in, then mi hands start tremblin' a bit. Not constantly, mind you. Just when it’s bad. And it’s not a full-on tremble, just… a little wobble, you know? Enough to make me a bit nervous when I'm usin' the nippers! Don't want to accidentally clip a toe! I always gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, nothin' at all with mi vision. Perfectly clear, thank you very much. I still read mi newspapers every mornin', and I can thread a needle if I have to. No blurry spots, no double vision, nothin' like that. I had mi eyes checked a couple years ago, everything was fine then. Still see the world as bright as ever. I’m grateful for that, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s have a feel. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit, yes. Right there, where you're pressin'. Not a sharp pain, but… tender. Like a bruise, almost. And a little bit here too, on the side of mi neck. It's not somethin' I'd normally notice, but when you press on it… yes, definitely tender. It's probably nothin', though, is it? I do spend a lot of time bendin' over.
DOCTOR: Alright, and can you look up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? It's a little stiff, Doctor. Not painful, exactly, but… restricted. I don't have the same range of movement as I used to, I suppose. Gets harder to do things as you get older. Not too bad, though, is it? I can still turn mi head enough to see who's comin' around. Important for an old man like me!
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications are you currently takin', if any?
PATIENT: Well, not much at all, Doctor. Just a little somethin' for mi arthritis in mi hands, helps with the stiffness. It's called… let me see… …Naproxen, I think it is. Just when it flares up, though, not every day. And I take a multivitamin, just to keep mi strength up. Otherwise, I try to stay natural. Don't like takin' too many pills, if I can avoid it. Too much chemistry in mi system already, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, nothin' at all. Never had a reaction to anythin', thank goodness. I've had all sorts of things over the years, doctor, and never a problem. I'm a pretty sturdy fella, all things considered. My wife always says I'm too stubborn to let anythin' bother me! Maybe that's why I'm still kickin' at 87!
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you have some tension in your neck and upper back, likely from your work. It's probably just a muscle strain. I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and some gentle stretching exercises. See if that helps.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Just a bit of muscle strain, you reckon? I was worryin' it was somethin' serious! Stretching exercises… I can manage that. Mi wife always tells me to stretch more, anyway. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen… that’s the stuff for aches and pains, right? I can pick that up at the pharmacy, easy enough. How often should I be takin' it, Doctor? And what kind of stretches would you recommend? I wouldn’t want to pull somethin'!
DOCTOR: Here. This has some basic stretching exercises and dosage instructions for the pain relief. Take it with food, and don't exceed the recommended dose. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets significantly worse, come back and see me. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry. And try to take breaks during your work, and maintain good posture. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Stretching exercises… these look manageable, I think. And the dosage instructions are clear enough. Good posture… mi wife will be pleased to hear you say that! She's always naggin' me about slouchin'. No, I don’t think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your time and advice. I feel much better now, just knowin’ it’s likely not somethin’ serious. I'll follow your instructions and see how it goes. I appreciate you listenin' to an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, and try not to overdo it. And remember, if it doesn't improve, come back. .
