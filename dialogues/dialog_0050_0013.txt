DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, I’ve been havin’ trouble… gettin’ all the pee out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops, even when I feel like there’s more there. It's been happenin’ for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing incomplete bladder emptying, beginning roughly a month ago. Can you describe this sensation in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… like there's still some in there, but it just won't come out. I have to… strain a bit, and sometimes it comes out in little bits after that. It’s not painful, just… frustrating. And I have to go back more often, you know?
DOCTOR: Frustrating indeed. And are you noticing any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is the issue solely with the complete emptying of the bladder?
PATIENT: No, startin’ isn't a problem. It comes pretty easy. It’s just… gettin’ it all out. Like a tap that doesn't quite turn off all the way, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very helpful analogy, Mr. Hilber. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I seem to be goin' more often than usual, like I said. And sometimes… at night, I wake up and have to go. That didn’t used to happen much. I’ve just been chalkin’ it up to gettin’ older, but maybe it's all connected?
DOCTOR: It very well could be connected, Mr. Hilber. Frequent urination, especially nocturia – that is, waking at night to urinate – are often associated with this type of issue. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Have you experienced any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My belly feels alright, no pain there. And… no, I haven't seen any blood. Just the trouble emptyin’ my bladder, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any change in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowels? Hmm… not really. Everything’s been pretty regular, I guess. Maybe a little… softer than usual, now that I think about it. But nothin’ too bad.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let’s move on to your medical history, Mr. Hilber. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Olsen, over at the community clinic. She's a good doctor. I see her for my yearly check-ups, mostly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you happen to recall if you've ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… Dr. Olsen told me my blood sugar was gettin' a little high a couple years back, but she said it wasn’t bad enough for medicine yet. She wanted me to watch my diet. Other than that… I don’t think so. No one ever told me I had anything with my prostate.
DOCTOR: Pre-diabetes, noted. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. When I was a young man, I broke my arm playin’ basketball. And… my wife, bless her heart, she had her gallbladder out a few years back, and I stayed with her at the hospital then. But I haven’t been in the hospital myself, not really.
DOCTOR: Broken arm in youth, wife's gallbladder surgery – thank you. Now, Mr. Hilber, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands. It's called… glucosamine, I think. And sometimes, when my hands are really bad, I take ibuprofen. But that's about it.
DOCTOR: And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes. And my brother… he had problems with his heart. But other than that, nothin' I can think of. Most of my family lived long, healthy lives, out fishin’ and workin’ hard.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your brother. And finally, Mr. Hilber, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, since my wife passed. I keep busy tryin’ to fix things around the house. I like to carve little things outta wood, when my hands are feelin’ good. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a little beer, but I cut back on that a while back. I mostly just take it easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and, most importantly, a neurological exam and a digital rectal exam. The digital rectal exam is essential to evaluate the size and consistency of your prostate. It’s a standard procedure in cases like yours, and will help me determine the potential cause of your urinary symptoms. Do you have any objections to this examination?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well, I… I’ve never had one of those before. It doesn't sound very pleasant. Is it… is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Hilber. While I understand your discomfort, a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of assessing your condition. It allows me to directly feel for any abnormalities in the prostate gland – enlargement, tenderness, or irregularities – which could be contributing to your urinary difficulties. It’s a quick procedure, and will provide valuable information. We can proceed at your pace, and I will explain each step as we go. It’s a standard component of a urological evaluation. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. If you say it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… just please be gentle. And tell me what you're doin' as you go, like you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will be applying a lubricant to ensure comfort. I will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to palpate your prostate. You may feel some pressure, but it should not be painful. I will be assessing the size, shape, and consistency of the gland, and checking for any tenderness or nodules. Relax your muscles as much as possible. I'm feeling a slight enlargement, and the gland feels somewhat firm. No acute tenderness is present. Alright, Mr. Hilber, you may sit up when you are ready.
PATIENT: Well... that wasn’t as bad as I thought, but I’m still glad it's over. What did you find? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: As I mentioned, your prostate is mildly enlarged, and somewhat firm to the touch. This is a common finding in men your age, and could be indicative of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This simply means an enlargement of the prostate gland, which can obstruct the flow of urine. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order a urinalysis to check for infection or blood, a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, blood test to assess prostate health, and a bladder scan to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you void. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a lot of tests. Will those tests tell you for sure what’s wrong? And… how much will all that cost? I'm on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Those tests will significantly assist in establishing a definitive diagnosis, Mr. Hilber. While they aren't foolproof, they'll give us a clearer picture of the situation and guide the appropriate course of action. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers these tests, but there may be copays or deductibles. My billing department will be happy to provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. Let's proceed with the tests, and then we can discuss the results and potential treatment options. Do you have any further questions before I submit the orders?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get those orders sent off then, and I'll try not to worry too much 'til I hear back. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will schedule you for a blood draw and provide instructions for the urinalysis. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, I advise you to maintain a normal fluid intake, but avoid drinking large quantities of fluid before bedtime. This paper contains information about BPH and some general lifestyle recommendations. Please review it at your convenience. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Hilber. If anything changes or you experience any worsening of your symptoms, do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day.
