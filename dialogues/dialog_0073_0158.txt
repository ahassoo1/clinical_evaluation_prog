DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s about this…letter. My daughter said I need something from a doctor to…keep my dog, I think? It’s all a bit of a fuss, really. I don’t quite remember why they need a letter, just that it’s important for…ownership, or something. A silly thing to bother a doctor about, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A letter regarding dog ownership…right. Well, it’s not entirely uncommon for landlords or homeowner’s associations to require documentation. Sometimes it’s related to breed restrictions, or proof of responsible pet ownership. Do you recall what specifically the letter needs to state?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. My daughter handled all of that. She's very…organised. I just know it has something to do with keeping Winston. He’s a lovely dog, a bit spoiled, but a good boy. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those sorts of details. She just said “Mum, you need a doctor's note,” and here I am. Is it terribly important what’s in the note, or just that it’s from a doctor? I mean, they shouldn’t be asking me for medical things about a dog, should they?
DOCTOR: It is rather unusual to require a medical note for pet ownership, yes. Perhaps the letter is intended to verify your…capacity to care for a pet, given any potential health concerns. Though, as you say, it's a peculiar request. Do you have any chronic health conditions that your daughter mentioned might be relevant?
PATIENT: Oh, relevant? Well, I'm getting on a bit, aren't I? Forty-four is…not young anymore, I suppose. I've had the usual aches and pains, a bit of trouble with my back, but nothing a good lie-down won't fix. And my memory isn't what it used to be, clearly. I forget things all the time. But I manage perfectly well. Winston keeps me active, you know? Chasing after him in the park. My daughter worries too much, always has. Is that what they want to know? If I'm fit enough to walk a dog? Honestly, it’s a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: It seems your daughter is concerned about your overall health and ability to provide consistent care for Winston. That's…understandable, to a degree. Let's just do a quick check-up, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I suppose a quick look won’t hurt. But honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. It’s just my memory, and everyone forgets things sometimes, don’t they? I wouldn’t want you wasting your time on nothing. Just a quick look, you said? Because I have a hair appointment later, and those are very important.
DOCTOR: Of course. A quick assessment. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And perhaps a brief neurological check, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re doing a proper doctor thing. Honestly, all this fuss for a perfectly healthy dog owner. Well, alright. Examination table, is it? Just try not to poke too much, alright? My back isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes… Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but not significantly concerning. Can you tell me your date of birth, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers, already? Honestly, I'm terrible with dates. Let me think…It’s…June, definitely June. And the number…is it 12? No, that can't be right. My daughter always reminds me. It's…the 12th. June the 12th, 1981. I think. Or maybe 1980? It's all a blur, really. She's always saying I need to write things down. See? This proves my point! It's hardly a reason to bother a doctor, is it? A slightly foggy memory? Everyone's memory goes at some point.
DOCTOR: Right. June 12th, 1981. We can confirm that with your records. And you mentioned some back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the back. It flares up now and then. Nothing serious, you understand. Just aches, mostly when I've been bending over too much in the garden. Winston likes to bury his toys, you see, and I have to dig them up for him. A very spoiled dog, as I said. I take some over-the-counter pain relief, that usually does the trick. I don't want to be on any strong medication, I’m fine, honestly. It's just an old lady thing, I suppose. Oh, dear. That’s a bit tender.
DOCTOR: There’s some muscle spasm in your lower back. Nothing acute, but it's likely contributing to the discomfort. Do you have any difficulty with walking or standing for extended periods?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I mean, I don't run marathons or anything, but I manage perfectly well. I walk Winston every day, down to the park and back. It's a good walk, about twenty minutes each way. Sometimes my back aches a bit afterwards, but a good sit down with a cup of tea sorts it out. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not frail, you know? I just…forget things. And my back twinges sometimes. It’s hardly a medical crisis. All this fuss for a healthy dog owner and a slightly temperamental back. It’s just ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. Based on your account and the brief examination, it appears you have some mild lower back pain and some age-related memory difficulties. I wouldn't classify it as a "crisis", as you say. However, I do recommend a few things to manage your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Recommendations. Finally, getting somewhere useful. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding. Tell me, Doctor, will this finally get me that letter for Winston? Because honestly, he’s starting to give me the side-eye, and a dog with the side-eye is never a good sign.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye. I can write a letter stating that you are capable of providing adequate care for your dog, and that your memory difficulties and back pain are being managed. However, I must also include a recommendation for a follow-up with a neurologist to assess your memory further, and with a physical therapist for your back pain. It’s simply best practice. It’s also important to establish a baseline. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist? A neurologist? For a little forgetfulness? Honestly, Doctor, that’s absolutely ridiculous. I'm not falling apart, you know. And a physical therapist? I just need a stronger cup of tea and a good sit down. Is this letter going to require me to jump through hoops and undergo a battery of tests? Because frankly, if it does, Winston can go to live with my daughter. This is all getting very stressful, and a stressed owner doesn’t make for a happy dog. No neurologists, and certainly no physical therapists. Just the letter, please. A simple letter, stating I'm capable. Is that really so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your reluctance, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your overall well-being. Ignoring potential health concerns is not in your best interest. While I can write a letter stating you are currently capable of caring for Winston, I strongly advise you reconsider the referrals. The neurologist can rule out any underlying causes for your memory loss, and the physical therapist can provide you with exercises to manage your back pain effectively, preventing it from worsening. However, if you absolutely refuse, I can write a limited letter stating that you are currently able to provide basic care for your dog, but it will include a disclaimer recommending further evaluation with a neurologist and physical therapist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Honestly, the things I have to put up with. A disclaimer? Really? Is this what doctors do now, just write letters full of warnings and disclaimers? It’s a dog, Doctor, not a national treasure! Fine. A limited letter with a ridiculous disclaimer. But make it brief, alright? I don’t want to scare Winston's new landlord. And don’t put anything about “potentially worsening” back pain. I’m perfectly capable of managing it with tea and sensible shoes. Just write the letter, please. And quickly. My hair appointment is looming.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I will draft a letter stating you are currently capable of providing basic care for your dog, Winston, with a disclaimer recommending further evaluation with a neurologist and physical therapist. I will keep the disclaimer concise and avoid language regarding “potentially worsening” back pain. Here you are. Please review it, and let me know if you have any objections. And Ms. Wrye… I still strongly encourage you to reconsider the referrals. Your health is important.
PATIENT: Hmm…“capable of providing basic care”…sounds rather minimal, doesn’t it? Oh, and here’s the disclaimer…“recommend further evaluation”… Fine, fine. It’s enough. Just enough to appease the landlord. Thank you, Doctor. That will be all. And honestly, you’re a very thorough doctor, but a little less “evaluating” and a little more “letter-writing” next time, alright? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a hair appointment to get to. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes… goodbye, Ms. Wrye. .
