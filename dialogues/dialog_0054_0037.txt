DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. Like… a tea kettle, almost. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing with a whistling sound – that is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… maybe a week ago? It was not so bad at first. Just when I walked quickly, up the hill to the market. But now… it happens even when I am sitting. It feels… tighter, each day. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kilton. Gradual worsening is important information. So, it started with exertion – walking uphill – and now it’s happening at rest. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not all the time. Sometimes I feel fine, and then… suddenly, there it is. Especially if I try to do something. Or if the air feels… damp. Like today, perhaps? I do not know if the weather has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – associated with activity and potentially the weather. Do you notice anything else happening when you’re having trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Sometimes… my chest feels a little tight. Not pain, exactly. More like… squeezed. And I have been coughing a little, but not a bad cough. Just… a tickle in my throat. It is hard to explain. It is not a strong cough, Doctor. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight chest and a bit of a cough along with the whistling sound and breathing difficulty. Have you had a fever, chills, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, and not cold. My feet feel… normal. I check them every day, you see. My daughter, she is a nurse, and she tells me to always check my feet. She worries about me, bless her heart. No swelling, though. Just… tired, sometimes. But I am seventy-six, so… perhaps that is to be expected.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and it's wonderful that your daughter is so attentive. Feeling tired at 76 is quite common, but we want to make sure it's not related to your breathing. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have been healthy, mostly. I always walked a lot, even when I was working. I was an athletic trainer, you see. Lots of running and jumping with the young people. I never had any trouble breathing before. A little out of breath sometimes, but that was just from the exercise. Nothing like this. I have had… arthritis in my knees, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of lung problems, just arthritis in your knees. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A long time ago. When I was… oh, maybe fifty years ago. I broke my arm, playing volleyball. They had to put in a pin. But it healed very well. And… I had my gallbladder out, many years later. But that was… a simple surgery. Nothing complicated. It was… 1998, I think? A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm repaired and gallbladder removal in 1998. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My daughter always asks, of course, but I always tell her, “No, nothing.” She worries so much. Bless her heart. I did… have a little rash once, from poison ivy when I was a child, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my knees, Doctor. For the arthritis. It is called… Celebrex, I think? It helps with the pain, mostly. And… sometimes I take Tylenol, if the pain is very bad. But that is all. No vitamins, no herbal things. Just the Celebrex, and the occasional Tylenol.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for your knees and Tylenol as needed. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband… he used to smoke, a long time ago. But I always told him, “No smoking in the house!” He stopped, eventually. But I never smoked. Never liked it. Always thought it was… unhealthy. And my daughter… she would have been very upset! Bless her heart, she is very careful about health.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. No history of smoking. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mrs. Kilton. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, and I’ll also check your heart rate and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My daughter always says I should listen to the doctor. Bless her heart, she is very wise. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… deep breath in… and out… I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially as you exhale. It’s consistent with what you’ve been describing – that whistling sound. Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles, but it’s very subtle. I'm going to gently palpate your ankles to assess for pitting edema. Yes, slight pitting edema is present. Do you experience any pain in your ankles when you walk?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. Not a bad pain, but a little ache. Especially if I walk up the hill to the market. I just thought it was… my arthritis. It is always worse when it is cold, or damp. And the swelling… I thought my shoes were just a little too tight. I did not think it was… important. I am sorry. I do not want to bother you with silly things. Bless my heart, I worry too much.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Mrs. Kilton. It’s important to share everything, even what seems “silly.” The combination of the wheezing, the ankle swelling, and the achiness is concerning enough that I want to run a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and I’ll order a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just want to feel better. The breathing… it worries me. And the ankles… I do not want to end up stuck inside, unable to walk. I love to walk. It is good for me. Please, do whatever you need to do. And… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Bless your heart.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your concerns, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll get you over to radiology for the chest X-ray. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for the results, can you tell me if you’ve been feeling any chest pain or discomfort, or any shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Just… the tightness, sometimes. And the breathing… it is not so bad when I am sitting still. It is when I try to do something. Or if I get… excited. It feels like… I cannot get enough air. But it passes quickly. It is not constant. I just need to… rest for a moment. And it is better. It is hard to explain, I know. I do not want to bother you with silly things. Bless my heart, I worry too much. But thank you for listening, Doctor. It helps to talk about it.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, and you're explaining it perfectly. Intermittent tightness and difficulty with exertion is very helpful information. We need to rule out a few things, though. I'm concerned about the possibility of heart failure, given the ankle swelling and shortness of breath, and we also need to consider the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, especially given your breathing difficulties. We will look at the X-ray and blood results to see what is going on. While we wait, I want to ask you about your activity level. How many steps a day do you typically take?
PATIENT: Oh my. Heart failure? COPD? That sounds… serious, Doctor. I just thought it was… getting old. I do not know anything about steps, Doctor. I do not have one of those… step counters. I used to walk a lot, to the market and back. Maybe… a thousand steps? Or more? It is hard to say. I just walked until I was tired. I do not measure things, Doctor. I am an old woman, and I just… live. Bless my heart, I worry too much. But thank you for explaining, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're being honest with me, Mrs. Kilton. It is important to consider all possibilities. And it’s good that you've been active. A thousand steps is a good starting point. We're not making any diagnoses yet, we're just gathering information. The tests will help us understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very well. I just… hope it is not something too serious. I like my walking. And I do not want to… become a burden to my daughter. She has enough to worry about. Bless her heart, she is very kind. But thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. I trust you. And… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you stay healthy and active. It's wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready, and I’ll come back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting.
