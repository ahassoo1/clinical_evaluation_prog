DOCTOR: Hi Danny, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Good day to you too, Doctor. I… I think it’s for a check-up. Something about a… a team? My ex-wife, she signed me up for something. I don't really keep track of these things, you know? It's for sports, I believe. I used to be… fairly active. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up… and it sounds like your ex-wife may have enrolled you in a sports program?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A sports… thing. She’s always been… enthusiastic. I mostly do little jobs now, you know? Construction. Fixing things. Not much running around. Though, I used to play baseball. A long, long time ago. Is this… is this important? Are they going to make me run?
DOCTOR: It sounds like this check-up might be related to getting cleared for participation in the sports program. Don’t worry, we'll figure out what's needed. And we definitely won’t make you do anything you're not comfortable with. To start, can you tell me a bit more about what kind of construction work you do?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly do handyman stuff. Little repairs. Plumbing, mostly. Sometimes roofing, if it’s not too high up. I'm not… a spring chicken, you understand. I used to do bigger jobs, framing houses and such, but my back… it ain't what it used to be. It gets sore, you know? Especially after being on my knees for a long time. Does this matter for the… team thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know, Danny. Back soreness with kneeling is definitely something we need to consider. We'll want to explore that further. Before we focus on your back, let's get a general picture of your health. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: A… regular doctor? Not really. I used to, a long time ago, but then… things happened. Divorce, mostly. And then I got Medicare, and it's mostly just for… when something really breaks. I don't go poking around looking for trouble, you understand? Just fix what's broken, that's my motto. I don’t even remember the last time I had a full check-up. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Danny, it just means we'll need to do a bit more catching up today. It’s very common for people to fall out of regular check-up routines. And honestly, it's good you’re coming in now. Okay, so you're on Medicare. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Nothing comes to mind. I used to take something for… the hay fever, back when I had a yard. But that was ages ago. I don't really take much of anything these days, thankfully. Unless it really hurts, I just… tough it out. Is that a bad thing to do? My mother always said it builds character. Though, she also said a lot of things.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you don't have any known allergies. And while a little toughness can be good, sometimes ignoring pain can make things worse in the long run. That's what we're here for – to make sure you’re as comfortable and healthy as possible. Now, have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Major problems… Oh boy. Let me see. I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. And I had my appendix out, when I was a kid. That was… unpleasant. And… my ex-wife always said I had a problem with stress. But I don’t know if that counts. Nothing else comes to mind. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though, my knees… they ache, especially when it’s cold. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm, appendix removal, and some knee pain. We’ll definitely talk about those knees. And yes, knee pain absolutely counts. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix out?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Maybe… maybe a small thing on my shoulder, a long, long time ago. But it wasn't… serious. The doctor just poked around and fixed something. I don’t even remember what it was for. My memory ain't what it used to be, you understand? It's all a bit… fuzzy. I think it was for… a rotator cuff? Or something like that. I mostly just ignored it after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially a rotator cuff repair. It’s good you’re telling me everything you remember, even if it's fuzzy. It all helps build a complete picture. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, well… my ex-wife, of course. We have a daughter, but we don't see her much anymore. She's got her own life. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. And my father… he left when I was young. Not a close family, you understand. Mostly just me, myself, and I. Does knowing about my ex-wife help? She tends to… exaggerate things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Knowing about your immediate family is helpful. And don’t worry about exaggerations; we’ll focus on what you’re experiencing. Were there any major medical problems in your mother’s family or, if you know anything about it, your father’s side?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother… she had… high blood pressure, I think. And she always complained about her arthritis. Bad knees, like mine. As for my father… I don't really know. He wasn’t around much. My mother didn’t talk about him. I think he… drank too much. But I don’t know if that counts as a medical problem. Everything about him is… vague, you understand? A bit of a mystery. It's probably best not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis on your mother's side. That’s good to know. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no, never. Tried it once, back in high school, but it made me cough too much. Not for me. My mother always said it was bad for you. And I try to keep things… clean. I do a lot of work with my hands, you understand? Can't have smoky fingers. Though, I do enjoy a… a beer now and then, with dinner. Is that bad? Just one, maybe two.
DOCTOR: No, one or two beers with dinner is perfectly fine. That’s good to know. And that’s good you never started smoking. Do you drink alcohol regularly, like most days of the week?
PATIENT: Not really most days. Maybe… three or four times a week. Depends. If I've had a hard day, I might have a couple. It helps me relax. And I try not to overdo it. I'm not a… big drinker, you understand? Just a little something to take the edge off. Though, my ex-wife always said I used it to avoid… things. But she tends to exaggerate. It's just a habit, really. A small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few beers a few times a week. We’ll make a note of that. Do you use any other substances – prescription or otherwise?
PATIENT: Substances… Hmm. No, not really. I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. The doctor gives me pills, when it gets bad. But that's about it. Nothing else. I mostly just rely on… hard work and a good night’s sleep. Though, my ex-wife always said I was… stubborn. But she tends to exaggerate. Is that the kind of substance you’re talking about? Stubbornness? It's a character flaw, really. Not a substance.
DOCTOR: No, not stubbornness, Danny. I meant any other medications or recreational drugs. So, just the pills for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the pills for my arthritis. And sometimes a little something for my… indigestion. It gets bad after I eat spicy food. My ex-wife always made me eat really spicy food. Said it built character. But she tends to exaggerate. It’s just a little antacid. Nothing serious, you understand? Just to settle my stomach. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Danny. So, just pills for your arthritis and occasional antacids for indigestion. Okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees and shoulders. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That’s fine. Go ahead. Though, don't expect much. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a long time. My knees… they’re probably going to be the worst part. They ache something awful when it gets cold. And my shoulder… it sometimes cracks when I lift things. But I mostly ignore it. Do you need me to change into… a gown? I’m not really dressed for… cracking joints.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to change. We'll just do a basic exam with you clothed. It's fine to leave your shirt on. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated – 140 over 90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me, and let me see the range of motion?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Be careful, though. They might… crack. There. You heard that? Awful, isn’t it? It gets worse in the winter. And it feels… stiff. Like they’re full of sand. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. I used to play baseball, you know. But that was… a different life. Is this going to hurt? I don’t really like things being… poked and prodded. My ex-wife always said I was… sensitive. But she tends to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Okay, there's some tenderness on the inner side of both knees. And I do feel some crepitus – that’s the cracking sound you’re feeling. It doesn’t seem to be causing significant swelling. Now, let’s take a look at your shoulders. Can you raise your arms and rotate them for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. But don't expect much. It might… crack too. There. You heard that? That’s the one that bothers me the most. It gets… stuck sometimes. And it hurts when I lift heavy things. Like… like when I’m fixing a roof. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. It’s probably just… old age. My ex-wife always said I was… clumsy. But she tends to exaggerate. This is all a bit… unsettling, you know? Are you sure this isn't just… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s tenderness in the front of your right shoulder, and I do feel some limited range of motion. It sounds like you may have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees and potentially some rotator cuff issues in your right shoulder. It’s good you’re getting this checked out now, Danny. It sounds like the pain is interfering with your daily activities. Now, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knees and shoulder to get a better look at what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-rays… Oh boy. I haven't had those in… well, a long time. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like being… exposed to things. My ex-wife always said I was… paranoid. But she tends to exaggerate. Are you sure it's necessary? Couldn't we just… ignore it? Maybe take some pills? My arthritis pills usually help. Though, they don't always work. And they make me… sleepy. This is all a bit… overwhelming, you know? Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Small things, but things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: X-rays are a quick and painless procedure, Danny. The amount of radiation exposure is very low and it helps us to see the bones and joints clearly so we can determine the best course of treatment. It's not always about ignoring it, but about understanding what's going on so we can manage it effectively. It usually takes only a few minutes. We can schedule them right here in the clinic. And yes, we can discuss pain management options if needed. Before we proceed with the X-rays, would you like me to call someone to be with you?
PATIENT: No, no. I don't have anyone to call. My daughter… she's busy. My ex-wife… well, I wouldn’t call her. And all my friends… they've moved away. I'm used to being alone, you understand? Just… the quiet life. Alright. Fine. Let's do the X-rays. Just… try to make it quick. And be gentle, please. My ex-wife always said I was… fragile. But she tends to exaggerate. Is there anything else I need to know? Will it affect my ability to… fix things? That's all I really care about, you know? Being able to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Danny. We'll take it slow and be as gentle as possible. It shouldn’t interfere with your ability to fix things right away, but we’ll know more once we get the results. The technician will just need to position your knees and shoulder for a few moments. I’ll let you get changed, and the technician, Maria, will be right in. She's very good, and will explain everything. I'll be back to discuss the results once they are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Alright. That sounds… alright. Just… tell Maria to be gentle. And… don't let her poke too much. I don’t like being… prodded. My ex-wife… well, you know. Alright. Lead the way. I suppose. And thank you… for being patient. It’s not easy… explaining things. It's all a bit… hazy, you understand? A long time ago. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Of course, Danny. Take your time, and remember to let Maria know if you feel any discomfort at all. We're here to help, and we’ll get through this together. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: .
