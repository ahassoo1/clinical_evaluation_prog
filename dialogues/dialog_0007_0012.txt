DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I am planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They’ve asked for… well, a bit of a rundown, I suppose. I thought it best to get it from a proper doctor, rather than try to remember everything myself.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-cruise medical assessment. Smart move. Plenty of things can come up on those trips, better to be prepared. Let’s start with the basics then. I see here you're 45 years old... and your height and weight are listed as 171cm and 109lbs – is that all still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly correct. I haven’t changed a bit, thankfully! Though my scales are quite new, so I trust them implicitly. One hundred and nine pounds, and one hundred and seventy-one centimetres. It’s a bit of a bother converting everything, really, but there you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And you mentioned the cruise line just needs a general rundown... any specific concerns they highlighted, or are we starting from scratch with your medical history?
PATIENT: No, nothing specific highlighted. They just had a rather long form with lots of questions about…well, everything, really! Past illnesses, operations, allergies…the usual sort of thing. I don’t think I have anything particularly alarming to report, but I figured a doctor's opinion would be best to ensure I haven’t forgotten anything important. It's been a few years since I had a thorough check-up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your past medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite healthy, touch wood. Nothing like diabetes or high blood pressure. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that cleared up on its own with plenty of rest and warm drinks. My mother had…well, she had a bit of trouble with her arthritis in her later years, but I don't believe I've inherited that, thankfully. My joints are still perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, as a child I had my tonsils removed. A very common thing, I believe, back in those days. It was quite unpleasant at the time, but I recovered well. And…oh! When I broke my wrist, many years ago, I was hospitalised overnight for observation. A silly accident, falling off a bicycle. But that was decades ago, and it healed perfectly. Nothing since then, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture, both long ago and fully healed. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. I can eat anything, drink anything… I'm very fortunate that way. My friends always tease me about it, saying I have an iron stomach! I’ve never had a reaction to any food or medication, as far as I can remember. Though I do prefer tea to coffee, if that counts for anything!
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, to be honest. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever possible. Just a cup of tea and a good night’s sleep, that’s my usual remedy. I might take a paracetamol for a headache occasionally, but that’s the extent of it. Nothing regular, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No regular medications. Let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My father had heart trouble in his later years, I believe. He was a smoker, unfortunately, and it eventually caught up with him. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, was diagnosed with breast cancer, but that was quite a long time ago. Other than that…not that I recall. My mother lived to a good age, and she was relatively healthy, all things considered. But that’s about all I can think of, honestly. It’s a bit difficult to remember everything from years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart trouble in your father, breast cancer in your aunt. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no recreational drugs! And I gave up smoking years ago – a very sensible decision, I assure you. I do enjoy a nice cup of tea, as I’ve mentioned, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Lots of fruit and vegetables, mostly. I try to keep active, too – a bit of gardening, walking the dog… nothing too strenuous, but enough to keep me moving. I believe in a sensible lifestyle, Doctor. That's the key.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs, sensible diet and regular activity. That's excellent. Okay, Velda, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam - just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. I have no objections at all. Please proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I do hope you don't find anything alarming! Though, as I said, I generally feel quite well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax for me. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is perfectly normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Everything sounds good, Velda. Your vitals are stable, and the exam didn’t reveal anything concerning. Based on your history and the exam, it seems you're in good health, and should be fit for your cruise.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor! That’s a great relief, indeed. I was a little worried I might have forgotten something important, but it sounds as though everything is in order. Thank you very much for your thorough examination and for putting my mind at ease. Would you happen to have something in writing I could take to the cruise line, just to confirm your assessment?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll generate a summary report outlining your medical history, the findings of the physical exam, and my assessment that you are fit to travel. It will state there are no contraindications to travel, and include my signature. Here you go. This report should be sufficient for the cruise line. I’ve also included a general recommendation to stay hydrated and practice sun safety while on your trip, just as a precaution. Do you have any questions about the report, or anything else before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, excellent! That is perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. Yes, this looks exactly what they need. And the advice about hydration and sun safety is very sensible, thank you. No, I don't believe I have any further questions. You’ve been most helpful and thorough. I really appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. I wish you a very good day. And thank you once more for putting my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! Have a wonderful time, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns after your trip. .
