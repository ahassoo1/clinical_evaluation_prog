DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda sore. Been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple of months?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. Bumps on your shins that have been present for a couple of months, and they’re red and sore. I understand. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you describe them a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They’re not… huge, you know? Like, maybe the size of a pea, some a little bigger. And they’re kinda hard. Not squishy. And itchy, sometimes. Mostly just sore when I walk a lot. I do a lot of walking at work, moving things around. They’re mostly on the front of my shins, like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, pea-sized, hard, sometimes itchy, mostly sore with walking, and located on the front of your shins. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps, for sure. When I sit down and put my feet up, they don't bother me as much. And, uh… I don’t know if this matters, but wearing long pants helps too. Rubbing against things makes them feel worse. I usually wear shorts when I’m not working, but I’ve been wearing pants more lately because of these bumps.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and wearing pants seem to alleviate the discomfort. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes to your legs, like swelling, discoloration, or any open sores?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Just the bumps, really. And no, no open sores or anything like that. They're just… red and hard. Sometimes a little warm to the touch, maybe? I haven’t really paid that much attention. I mostly just notice them when my legs are tired after work. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no swelling, no open sores, potentially a little warmth. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, circulation problems, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… let me think. I’ve got high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a pill for it every day. Other than that… not really. No diabetes, no skin problems that I know of. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. My wife keeps me in line with the pills, though. She's good at that. Medicare covers everything, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, that's good to know. And thank you for mentioning that your wife helps you stay on top of things. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my arm, falling off a mango tree when I was young. But other than that, nothing major. No surgeries recently, nothing like that. Been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal as a child and a broken arm, otherwise healthy. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother had… heart trouble, I think. She had to take medicine for it. And my father… he had problems with his legs when he got older. I don’t know exactly what, just that he had trouble walking. He lived in the Philippines, so it was hard to get good doctors back then. That’s about all I remember, really. My siblings are mostly healthy, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart trouble and leg problems in your father. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, Doctor. A little white pill. My wife gets it filled every month. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s not regular. Just when I need it. And, uh… sometimes I take a little something for my joints when they’re acting up, but that's just when they're really sore. It’s an over-the-counter thing, I can’t remember the name. Nothing fancy. Mostly just the blood pressure pill, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, primarily on a blood pressure medication with occasional use of over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches and joint pain. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything my wife cooks, and that's saying something! No allergies, no rashes, nothing like that. I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to. We live in the city, so I breathe the same air as everyone else. No problems there.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work at the warehouse. Mostly moving things around – boxes, pallets, you know? A lot of walking, a lot of lifting. It’s hard work, but it keeps me busy. I’ve been doing it for… oh, a long time now. Maybe twenty years? I’m on my feet most of the day, that's for sure. It pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, warehouse work involving a lot of walking and lifting. That's helpful information. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs. Could you please sit on the examination table, and I’ll begin with a physical examination?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Go ahead, take your time. Let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I’m going to take a look at your legs. I see several small, reddish, firm bumps on the front of both shins. They range in size from about pea-sized to slightly larger, maybe half an inch. They appear to be somewhat clustered together. Do they feel tender to the touch when I press on them?
PATIENT: Yes, they do. Oh, that’s a little sore, yes. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. Especially right there. And that one too, a little bit. They feel kind of hard, like… like little stones under the skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting tenderness upon palpation, and they do feel firm, almost nodular. I don't see any signs of inflammation or open sores. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in both feet to assess your circulation. Can you tell me if you've ever had any problems with your circulation, like cold feet or leg pain at rest?
PATIENT: No, no problems with my circulation. My feet get a little cold sometimes in the winter, but that's it. Nothing major. And no pain when I'm sitting down. I walk a lot, so I figure my circulation is okay. It has to be, right?
DOCTOR: Good. Your pulses are strong and regular, which is reassuring. Now, I’m going to check the range of motion in your ankles and knees. Can you point your toes up and down, and bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There we go. A little creaky, maybe, but they still work. Getting old, you know? But they haven’t given out on me yet. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. There's some mild crepitus, which is common with age, but your range of motion is good. Based on the physical exam, and your history, the bumps on your shins sound most likely to be shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome. They are common in individuals who increase their activity level, or participate in activities that involve repetitive impact. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Shin splints, huh? That… sounds about right, actually. I did start lifting a little heavier boxes at work a few weeks ago. More deliveries, they said. More work. So that makes sense. Blood work… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It can’t hurt, right? I trust your judgment. What will the blood work tell you?
DOCTOR: The blood work will help rule out other potential causes of the bumps, such as infection or inflammatory conditions. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I recommend the following: rest as much as possible, ice the affected areas for 15-20 minutes several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. Also, ensure you are wearing supportive shoes, even at work if possible. We’ll review the results when they come back, and adjust the plan if needed. Would you like a prescription for any pain relief medication today?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Rest, ice, and those pills… I can do that. Supportive shoes… I'll have to see about that at work. It's not always easy to wear fancy shoes when you're moving boxes all day. A prescription for the pain relief… yes, that would be good, if you think it’s necessary. Just something to take the edge off. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen 600mg, to be taken three times a day as needed for pain. I'll also send the lab order to the lab near the clinic. You can go there at your convenience. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the results and assess your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, worsening pain, redness or swelling, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. Two weeks… I'll remember that. And I’ll be careful, and watch out for those things you mentioned. Thank you very much for your time and help. I feel much better knowing what's going on, and what to do about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will give you the prescription and instructions on how to schedule your lab work. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
PATIENT: .
