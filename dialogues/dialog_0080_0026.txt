DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, it’s… tiredness, mostly. A lot of tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Makes it hard to… do things. I used to be very active, you know. A commercial diver, believe it or not. Not many ladies do that sort of work. Though, I don’t quite recall when I was doing it all the time... it was a long time ago. The young man at the front desk said something about… numbers being high? Something in my blood?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, that’s a good place to start. And you’re right to mention the blood work – yes, the front desk flagged some results we need to discuss. It is helpful you recall that. It sounds like it’s affecting your daily life now, which is important. When you say it comes and goes, can you describe how long it lasts when it's bad?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… Well, it’s not like a cold, you know? It doesn’t come for a few days and then go. It’s… stretches. Days, sometimes. Maybe a week. And then I’ll have a good spell, where I feel… almost normal. But then it just… comes back. It’s very inconvenient. And I don't understand what all this testing is for, honestly. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what we’re looking for. It doesn’t automatically mean anything serious, but we need to figure out the cause of the tiredness to know for sure. The tests help us do that. A week-long stretch is definitely something we need to investigate. To get a better picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Well, my muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Just… after I’ve been doing something. Even something simple. Like gardening. Or… walking. And I feel… weak, I suppose. A bit shaky. Though, that might just be my age. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be, naturally. My husband keeps telling me to slow down, but I have things to do!
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and weakness alongside the tiredness… and it's worse with activity. That's helpful. And yes, it’s good your husband is looking out for you, but it's important to understand what's causing the weakness, regardless of age. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical conditions… Let me see. I've had the usual things, I suppose. A bit of arthritis, in my hands. And my blood pressure… it goes up and down. The doctor keeps giving me pills for it. And… well, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. But that was a long time ago. Nothing major, really. Honestly, I don't remember much about any of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, high blood pressure managed with medication, and gallbladder removal. That's good to know. And don't worry about not remembering details – we have access to your records, so we can fill in any gaps. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the pills. Let me see… there's a white one, and a little blue one. I take them every morning, with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little orange tablet. But that’s only when it’s really bothering me. I think that’s all. My husband does most of the remembering, to be honest. He’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill and a little blue pill daily, and an orange tablet for arthritis as needed. We'll get the exact names of those from your records, don't worry. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always very frail. And my brother, he had… diabetes, I believe. He wasn’t very careful with his diet. And… oh, my grandfather, he had trouble walking when he got older. Something with his legs, I think. But honestly, it was so long ago. I don’t recall the details. We weren’t a very close family, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart issues, diabetes, and walking difficulties. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never. Not a drop of alcohol. And certainly not… those things. I'm a respectable woman, you know. Always have been. My husband doesn't drink either. We live a quiet life, mostly. A bit of gardening, a bit of television. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ardelle. And it's perfectly fine to live a quiet life. Now, just to finish up with the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. I get a bit of a rash sometimes, if I'm bitten by a mosquito, but that's not an allergy, is it? And… oh, I remember once, years ago, I had a bad reaction to some sort of shellfish. But that was a very long time ago. I haven't eaten shellfish since. Otherwise, no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible reaction to shellfish in the past, and some sensitivity to mosquito bites. That's good to know. Alright Ardelle, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few simple tests to assess your strength and reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle. I’m not as sturdy as I used to be, you know. And… try not to take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we'll take it slow. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear. Okay, strength is slightly reduced in both arms and legs. Reflexes are a little diminished. Thyroid feels normal. Okay, Ardelle, everything seems generally okay, but the slightly reduced strength, diminished reflexes, and elevated blood pressure are things we’ll need to investigate further. Given your tiredness and the bloodwork results, I'd like to order a few more tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… more tests? Honestly, this is all very confusing. What sort of tests? And… will they be painful? I don't like needles, you know. And… what are you looking for, exactly? You're not finding anything serious, are you?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. Let me explain. We're going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia or infection, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to look at your kidney and liver function and electrolytes, a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to check your thyroid, and a Vitamin D level. We’ll also check your A1C to see your average blood sugar over the past few months. The blood draw itself will be a quick pinch – most people don't find it very painful. You might feel a little sting, but it's over quickly. We’re looking for clues to explain your tiredness and muscle weakness. Things like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies can cause those symptoms. It’s too early to say definitively if anything is serious. That’s why we need these tests to give us more information. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. Anemia… thyroid… I don’t even know what those are. And you’re going to take my blood? Well… I suppose so. If it’s important. But please, be quick about it. And… will I have to fast before these tests? My husband makes a lovely breakfast, and I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: I know it seems like a lot, Ardelle, but these tests will help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms. Anemia is when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells, and it can make you feel tired and weak. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that controls your metabolism – if it's not working properly, it can also cause those symptoms. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drink except water. It’s important for accurate results. You can have breakfast after the tests, and I’m sure your husband’s breakfast will taste even better then! I'll write up the order for the lab tests now, and I'll give you a slip with the instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. Would you like me to order a referral to a specialist if the tests show something concerning, or would you prefer to discuss it with me first?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A specialist? No, no specialists, not yet! I don't like going to different doctors. I'm perfectly happy discussing it with you first. Please. I trust your judgement. You seem like a sensible young woman. Just… tell me what the tests show, and we’ll go from there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. We’ll take it one step at a time. We'll review the results together, and I’ll explain everything clearly. You are in control of your care. Here’s the lab order and these instructions explain what you need to do to prepare for the tests. They'll call you when your results are ready, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Though… will these tests interfere with my gardening? I have a lovely patch of roses that need tending to. I wouldn’t want to neglect them.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ardelle! The blood draw shouldn’t interfere with your gardening at all. You might feel a little tired afterwards, but you should be able to get back to your roses shortly after. Just don’t overexert yourself. Alright then. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results come in. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Get well soon, Ardelle. And enjoy your roses!
PATIENT: .
