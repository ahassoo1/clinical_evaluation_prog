DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s these… episodes. My wife, Srey, she’s been worried. I get… lost, sometimes. Not lost lost, like wandering around, but… things don't make sense for a bit. Like I’m looking at something I’ve seen a thousand times, but it’s… new. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Episodes, you say. And this is a new development, or has this been happening for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not new new. Maybe… six months now? At first, Srey thought I was just getting old, you know? A little forgetful. But it’s more than that. It’s like a… a break in the thinking. A little gap. And it’s happening more often. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. Just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Six months. And these “breaks,” as you call them… can you describe what happens during one of these episodes?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. It's hard to explain. I'm aware I'm not… right. Like I’m watching myself, almost. Everything looks normal, sounds normal, but… I struggle to place things. I was fixing a tile on the roof last week, a simple job, I’ve done it hundreds of times. And suddenly… I couldn't remember which way the trowel went. Which way to hold it! It's foolish, really. A grown man, confused by a trowel. Then it passes, and I’m fine. But it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: So, disorientation, specifically with familiar tasks… and a sense of detachment during these episodes. Have you experienced any memory loss outside of these events?
PATIENT: Detachment… that’s a good way to put it, yes. And no, not really. I remember things. Dates, names, where I put my tools – usually. Srey says I repeat stories sometimes, but that's just because I've lived a long life, Doctor. Lots of stories to tell. It’s not like I forget who she is or where we live. It’s just… these moments. These little… glitches.
DOCTOR: Glitches. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. No headaches. No dizziness. I’m still eating, still sleeping. Though, Srey says I’ve been a little… quieter lately. More withdrawn. I suppose that could be it. Just… not as much interest in things. The garden is looking a mess, and I haven’t even noticed. Usually, I’m out there every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reduced interest, withdrawal… and no associated neurological symptoms like headaches or dizziness. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. Can’t remember the name, though. And my knees are bad, getting old, you know. Arthritis. But that’s it, really. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Until these… things started.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… let me see… ah, yes, Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And arthritis. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… let me think… oh, a few years back, I had a cataract removed from my right eye. That’s it, I think. No broken bones, nothing major. I’ve been lucky, really. Mostly just aches and pains from years of working with tile. It's hard work, you know.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, cataract surgery… Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Srey’s family is very healthy, mostly farmers, lived long lives. My father… he had some problems with his memory towards the end. Not like this, though. He was just… confused, you know? Old age, they said. My mother… she died young, from an illness. I don’t remember much about it. We didn’t have doctors like you back then.
DOCTOR: Father with late-life confusion… Alright. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Too expensive. And I drink… sometimes. A little beer with dinner, maybe. Not every night. And definitely no other… substances. I’m a simple man, I like simple things. Work, family, a good meal. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs, and then I'd like to do a brief neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… I hope you can figure out what’s going on. It’s unsettling, not being… right.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here. First, I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. A little elevated blood pressure, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s do a few simple tests to assess your memory and reflexes. Could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… August… let me think… August 2nd. 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I always remember the date. Srey makes me write it down every day, just in case.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can. What are the words, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Apple, Table, Penny. Remember those three words. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it?
PATIENT: 2025. Like I said, I remember the date.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you spell the word “world” backwards?
PATIENT: … D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? It’s been a long time since I had to spell things backwards. Srey does all the paperwork now.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, let's try a simple calculation. If I have ten apples and I give three to my neighbor, how many apples do I have left?
PATIENT: Seven. Ten minus three is seven. Simple math, Doctor. I still have a good head for numbers, even if my memory… sometimes falters.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head. Eyes are following smoothly, no nystagmus. Now, I'm going to check your strength and reflexes. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Finally, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: … Apple… and… um… Penny. I’m sorry, I can’t remember the third one. It’s on the tip of my tongue… Table? No… something else. It’s frustrating, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Apple, Penny, but unable to recall Table. Okay. Based on this brief examination, your vital signs are stable, your neurological exam is largely intact, but there's some evidence of short-term memory impairment. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but these episodes, combined with the memory lapses, warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also think it would be beneficial to get a brain scan – a CT or MRI – to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a scan… yes, I understand. Sounds… serious. But if it helps figure out what’s going on, then I’m willing. I just… I don’t want to lose myself, Doctor. Srey worries enough already. What does the scan show, exactly? And how long will all this take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. It’s good that you’re being proactive. The scan, a CT or MRI, will help us visualize your brain. It can rule out things like stroke, tumors, or other structural abnormalities. It’s a non-invasive procedure. As for how long it will take… the blood work can be done today, and the results should be back within a few days. Scheduling the scan may take a little longer, depending on availability, perhaps a week or so. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and help determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… thorough. I suppose that’s a good thing. A week for the scan… alright. And the blood work today. Srey will be glad. She’s been pushing me to get checked out for weeks. Do I need to do anything special for the blood work? Fasting, or anything like that? And… what if the scan shows something?
DOCTOR: For the blood work, yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks other than water. We'll give you specific instructions when you go to the lab. As for what if the scan shows something… well, that's why we're doing it. If we find something, we'll discuss it with you in detail, explain your options, and develop a treatment plan together. It's important to remember that not all findings require immediate intervention. Sometimes, we can monitor things over time. I want to assure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results of the blood work and the scan, and we can discuss everything in more detail. In the meantime, I'm going to give you some written information about memory loss and some resources for support. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, Doctor. Fasting… scan… neurologist… It’s a lot to take in. Srey will be relieved to hear we’re getting things checked out. She worries so much. Thank you for taking the time, Doctor. And for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. It’s my job. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get the lab order and referral to the neurologist sent over right away. And remember, we’re here to support you and Srey. I’ll see you in a week or so, once we have the results. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
