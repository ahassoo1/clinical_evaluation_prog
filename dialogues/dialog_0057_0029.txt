DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… feeling full really quick when I eat. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now. Don't seem to be able to get much down these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re feeling full quickly when you eat, and it sounds like you haven’t been able to eat much lately. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It doesn’t matter what I eat, really. A little bit of soup, a few bites of fish… even just a small plate of bannock. I get that stuffed feeling after only a couple mouthfuls. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable and bloated. And it stays with me for a long time, even if I haven't eaten much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s not related to a specific food, and it’s more of an uncomfortable fullness and bloating, even with small portions. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe three or four months now? It started slow, just not bein’ as hungry as usual. Then it got to where I was pushin’ food around my plate more than eatin’ it. My wife, Elsie, she’s been worried, sayin’ I’m gettin’ too thin. She makes a good salmon chowder, but I just can’t finish a bowl anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months of gradually decreasing appetite and increasing fullness with small amounts of food. And your wife has noticed you've been losing weight. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this, such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, changes in your bowel habits – constipation or diarrhea – or any unintentional weight loss other than what your wife has observed?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomitin’, thankfully. Elsie does say I’ve been… regular, if you know what I mean. Same as always, there. And yeah, she’s right, I have lost weight. My pants feel looser, and I think my cheekbones are lookin’ a bit more prominent, ha! Not that I'm complainin' about havin' cheekbones at my age...but it's not from tryin', that's for sure. No heartburn or anything like that either. Just…less in my belly, all around.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or heartburn. Just a gradual decrease in appetite, early fullness, and unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: No trouble swallowin’ at all. I enjoy a good cup of tea, and that goes down just fine. And I haven't noticed any pain, no. Just… that full feeling, like someone put a brick in my stomach after barely a few bites. It’s strange. I used to be able to put away a good plate of food, especially if it was smoked salmon. Elsie's salmon is somethin' special, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty swallowing. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your enjoyment of food, and your wife is understandably concerned. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ major. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, back in ’62. And the doctor said I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it went down when I started walkin’ more. I don’t take any regular medicine now, just a bit of ibuprofen for my knees when they’re actin’ up. No allergies that I know of. Elsie says I’m as tough as an old cedar tree. She’s always been one for exaggeratin’, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removed in 1962, a history of high blood pressure that was managed with walking, and occasional ibuprofen for your knees. No known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any issues with weight loss, difficulty eating, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother, she was always a small woman, didn't eat a whole lot, but I don't recall her ever complainin’ about not bein' able to eat. My father, he was a fisherman, ate like a horse, always. Strong as an ox, he was. No, I don't recall any stomach troubles on either side of the family, really. Just good, strong folks who worked hard and ate what they needed. Elsie's family...her mother had some trouble with her digestion when she got older, but nothin' like this. It was more… gas, if you understand. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of weight loss or similar issues. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I retired about fifteen years ago, used to work at the radio station, doin’ a bit of everything. Now, I mostly take it easy. I like to walk down to the beach most days, if the weather's good. I still do a bit of carving, small cedar boxes, things like that. Elsie and I garden a bit, mostly vegetables. I enjoy a good cup of tea, and I don’t smoke or drink much alcohol. Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too wild these days. It's a pretty quiet life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fairly active lifestyle with walking and carving, and a healthy diet with vegetables. You don’t smoke, and only drink alcohol occasionally. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, Doctor. I’m used to a bit of pokin’ and proddin’, ha! Just let me know if you need me to breathe deep or anything. Elsie always said I’m a pretty easy patient.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight tenderness in the upper middle area when I press. It’s not sharply painful, just a bit sensitive. There’s no noticeable swelling or masses. Your spleen and liver feel normal in size. Alright, Mr. Obarr. Everything seems okay on initial examination, but that tenderness in your upper abdomen is something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms of early fullness, unintentional weight loss, and the tenderness I felt, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us check your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies. The CT scan will give us a more detailed look at your stomach, pancreas, and other abdominal organs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work and a scan…sounds a bit serious, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s needed, then let’s do it. Elsie will be wantin’ to know what’s goin’ on, for sure. She worries so. Will the scan…will it involve any needles or anything uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of needles, if I’m bein’ honest. And how long will it take to get the results? I'm hopin' it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr. The blood work will require a small blood sample, drawn from your arm. It’s a quick pinch, and it’s usually over very quickly. As for the CT scan, it does involve a small amount of intravenous dye to help visualize the organs better. That will require a small needle in your arm, but it’s usually well-tolerated. The radiology technician will explain the procedure in detail before it begins. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week for the blood work and scan to come back. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to go over everything in detail. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously, and we’re doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on. We’ll rule out the most common causes first, and then go from there. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: A few days to a week… alright. Elsie will be relieved to hear we’re gettin’ things checked out. And a needle, well, I suppose I can manage a little pinch. It's just… I’m not fond of hospitals or doctors in general. Never have been. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… what are you lookin’ for with the scan, exactly? Are you thinkin’ it could be somethin’ serious? I'm tryin' not to worry, but my mind's already racin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Obarr. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried when you’re facing uncertainty. The scan allows us to visualize your stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and other organs to look for any abnormalities – things like inflammation, masses, or blockages. We’re not jumping to any conclusions at this point, and it’s important to remember that many things can cause early fullness and weight loss. The scan will help us rule out more serious possibilities, such as stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, or gallbladder problems. It can also identify less serious conditions, such as gastritis or ulcers. Right now, we’re simply gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis. I will explain everything in detail once we have the results. Before you leave, I’m going to give you a referral for the blood work and CT scan. The referral will have all the necessary information, including the location and contact details for the radiology department. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to the appointment?
PATIENT: Transportation shouldn’t be a problem. Elsie drives, thankfully. She insists on takin’ me everywhere, even if I tell her I can walk. She worries too much, that woman. So, just… gastritis or ulcers… that doesn’t sound too bad. I suppose I should be thankful it's not somethin' worse, even if we don't know yet. I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly, Doctor. It helps to know what’s goin’ on, even if it’s a bit scary. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you again. I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my job to explain things as clearly as possible, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. Here is the referral information. Please schedule the blood work and CT scan as soon as possible. The radiology department will contact you to arrange a suitable appointment time. And please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Take care, Mr. Obarr.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll be sure to schedule the tests right away. And I will contact you if anything changes. Take care yourself.
