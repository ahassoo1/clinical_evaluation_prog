DOCTOR: Hi Werner, welcome in. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come get “cleared” before I go through with it. Seems a lot of fuss over a little… smoothing. I just want to get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A procedure your daughter wants you to get checked out before you proceed with it. That's very thoughtful of her. Can you tell me a little more about this “smoothing” – what kind of procedure is it, if you know?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the foggiest. She handles all these things. Something about my face… drooping, she said. It’s a waste of good money, if you ask me. I’ve lived eighty-one years with this face, it hasn’t bothered me any. But she’s paying, so… I suppose I’m here. It's some kind of lift, I think. A face lift. Don’t ask me details. I leave that to the young folks.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. It sounds like your daughter is arranging a facial cosmetic procedure for you, specifically a facelift. It’s good she’s involved and wants you to be well taken care of. To make sure you're a good candidate and to avoid any complications, I'll need to ask you a few questions about your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. This farm doesn’t run itself. Though, I suppose I'm retired now... still, a man gets used to a routine. Ask away.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Years ago. They put me on a pill for it. Been taking it regularly... mostly. Don't see the doctor much, though. Waste of time, if you ask me. Nothing else, not that I recall. I’ve always been a strong, healthy Norwegian man. Worked hard my whole life. That's good for you, you know. Better than sitting around.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That's good to know. And you feel generally healthy overall?
PATIENT: Generally. My knees ache a bit in the cold, and I get tired easier than I used to, but… that comes with age, doesn’t it? I can still manage the farm, though. Well, the important parts. My grandson does the heavy lifting these days. Don't go thinking I'm frail, mind you.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It sounds like you're very active for your age, and that's wonderful. The knee pain and fatigue are common with age, and we can certainly talk about those if you'd like. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think... appendicitis when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was helping with the barn, but that wasn't a hospital stay, just a cast. Nothing serious, nothing lately. Honestly, I avoid doctors like the plague. Always poking and prodding, telling you what you can't do.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy as a child, and a broken arm. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see... I take something for my knees, a cream. Rub it on at night. My daughter gets it for me. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take a little something for that, too. Ibuprofen, I think? The orange bottle. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. She keeps track of it all. I just take the pills when I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're using a cream for your knees and ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis. And your daughter manages keeping track of your medications. That’s good she’s so involved. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Norwegian food, mostly. Good, hearty fare. Don't go with those fancy newfangled things, though. Give me a good piece of fish and potatoes any day. And no, no allergies. Never had them. I’m a simple man, really.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he died young. Nasty habit. No thank you. Fresh air and hard work, that’s what keeps a man going. Always have, always will.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. A good Norwegian knows how to enjoy a brew, but I'm not a drinker. Just a pint or two on a special occasion. Don't go making a fuss over it. It’s not like I’m falling over every night.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pint or two occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, before we get to the physical exam, is there anything about your family history – any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had a weak heart. Died when I was still a boy. And my brother had some kind of trouble with his lungs. Smoked too much, if you ask me. My father was healthy as an ox, though. Worked until the day he died. It's all a bit of a blur, really. It was a long time ago. And we didn't talk about these things much back then. Just dealt with it. Stop making me think so hard! This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems on your mother’s side and lung issues in your brother. I understand it’s difficult to recall details from a long time ago, and that’s perfectly alright. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health and make sure you're a good candidate for this procedure, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the area where you’ll be having the procedure done. Will that work?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t go poking around too much. I’ve got things to do, you know. Farms don’t run themselves. And hurry it up, will you?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be great. Your heart sounds strong, although I do hear a very slight murmur – it’s not concerning given your age and history, but good to note. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 135/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your skin looks good overall, some expected wrinkles, of course, but no major concerns. I’m also noting a slight tenderness when I gently palpate the forehead area. Do you experience any pain or discomfort there regularly?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Hmph. Sometimes. My daughter says it’s tension. She keeps telling me to relax more. Relax! What am I supposed to do, sit around and twiddle my thumbs? I've been a farmer my whole life. It's hard work. It’s probably just… from frowning, I suppose. I don't smile much these days. Too many worries. Farms are expensive, you know. And the weather… always a problem. Don't go making a fuss over a little tenderness. It's nothing. Really. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tenderness in the forehead, likely related to tension and worry. I won’t make a fuss, but it’s good to note. Given your history of high blood pressure, the tenderness, and the fact that you're having a facial procedure, I think it would be prudent to get a baseline EKG just to make sure everything is okay. And while we’re at it, a quick blood test to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels would be helpful, too. It's just standard procedure to ensure your safety. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More poking and prodding?! Honestly! First an EKG, now blood tests? Is this necessary? My daughter will have my hide if I don’t do what the doctor says, so… fine. Do what you have to do. But I swear, if this takes all day… I'm not promising anything. Just get it over with quickly, will you? And make sure your nurse is gentle with the needle. I don't like needles. At all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I'll make it as quick and painless as possible. These tests are just a precaution to ensure everything is safe before proceeding. I’ll personally make sure the nurse is very gentle with the needle. Alright, let me get the order for the EKG and blood tests sent to the lab. It will probably take about 30-45 minutes to get those results back. In the meantime, we can discuss the procedure itself and what you can expect. Would you like to do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it. But don't expect me to remember all the details. My mind isn’t what it used to be. And if it takes longer than 45 minutes, I'm holding you responsible. Just… hurry. And speak clearly. Don’t mumble. Farms don’t wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I’ll speak clearly and slowly, and we can take as much time as you need. So, this procedure, called a facelift, is designed to lift and tighten the skin on your face and neck. It involves making small incisions along your hairline and around your ears. Through these incisions, the underlying tissues are lifted and repositioned, and any excess skin is removed. It’s typically done under local anesthesia, so you’ll be awake during the procedure, but you won’t feel any pain. It usually takes about 2-3 hours to complete. We’ll be working with a very experienced surgeon, Dr. Anya Sharma. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Incisions? Around my ears? That sounds… unpleasant. And awake the whole time? No, no, I don’t like the sound of that at all. I want to be asleep. Completely asleep. I don’t want to feel a thing. Is that possible? Surely you can knock me out for a little while. This is a modern hospital, isn’t it? Don’t tell me you’re just going to poke and prod while I’m conscious! That sounds barbaric.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. You're right to ask. While a facelift can be done under local anesthesia, it can also be performed under general anesthesia, meaning you’d be completely asleep. Given your anxiety and your preference, I absolutely think that’s a reasonable option. We would need to get a consultation with the anesthesiologist to ensure you’re a good candidate, of course, to review your medical history and make sure there are no contraindications. Would you like me to schedule that consultation for you?
PATIENT: General anesthesia… that’s what I want. Completely asleep. Yes, please. Schedule it. Immediately. And make sure it’s a good anesthesiologist. Not some young whippersnapper fresh out of school. Someone experienced. Someone who knows what they’re doing. I don't want any surprises. And tell them to give me something to calm my nerves before I go under. This whole thing is making me anxious just thinking about it. Do that, and we'll talk. But for now, just schedule the anesthesiologist. And hurry! I’ve got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll schedule a consultation with Dr. Chen, our most experienced anesthesiologist. She’s excellent and will be able to address all your concerns and discuss pre-operative medications to help calm your nerves. I’ll also make a note to let her know you’d prefer to be completely asleep during the procedure. Okay, the consultation is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. I'll have the nurse send you a reminder text. In the meantime, while we wait for those results and the anesthesiology consult, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: Nine o’clock… fine. Tomorrow morning. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my routine. No, I suppose not. Just… try to keep it as simple as possible. Don’t confuse me with a lot of medical jargon. And make sure the surgeon is good. Really good. My daughter is counting on me to make the right decision. And I don’t want to waste my money on a botched job. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I think I’ve had enough of this poking and prodding for one day. Can I go now? I've got to check on the hay bales. And tell Dr. Chen I expect a thorough explanation. No rushing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can absolutely go now. I’ll make sure Dr. Chen understands your concerns and will take her time to explain everything thoroughly. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed today, as well as the contact information for the lab and Dr. Chen’s office. Thank you for coming in today, Werner. We’ll do everything we can to make sure this procedure is safe and successful for you. If you have any questions at all between now and your consultation with Dr. Chen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, go check on those hay bales. And thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. If you’ll excuse me… .
