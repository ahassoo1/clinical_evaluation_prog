DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, actually. I’ve been feeling really tired and yellow-looking, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I didn't think that could be a thing, you know?
DOCTOR: That is interesting, Mande. Tired and yellow-looking… and it seems to correlate with eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s like… a few hours after I have them, I start to feel weak, and my skin gets this yellowish tint. It’s not every time, but most of the time. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I started to wonder if it was the beans causing it. I really like them, so I was hoping it wasn’t!
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The first time was maybe six months ago, but I didn’t really connect it to the beans then. It was just a one-off feeling unwell. But it's definitely happened three times in the last two months, and each time I had fava beans beforehand. So, probably two months consistently, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Alright, two months of consistent correlation. And besides the tiredness and yellowing of your skin, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. I’ve been a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I walk up the stairs. And I think my heart has been racing a little faster than usual. It’s not constant, but I’ve noticed it a few times. Oh, and my pee has been… darker, like a really dark yellow. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mande. Dark urine is definitely something we need to explore. Let's go through a bit more detail. When you say short of breath, is it with exertion only, or do you experience it at rest as well?
PATIENT: It's mostly with exertion, Doctor. Like, walking up the stairs or carrying groceries. I haven't noticed it when I'm just sitting or lying down. It doesn’t last long, just until I catch my breath. But it’s enough to worry me. And the heart racing… that’s maybe once or twice a week, just a fluttering feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, and no nausea or vomiting. My bowel movements have been… normal, I think. Nothing different there. Just the tiredness, the yellow skin, the dark pee, the breathlessness, and the heart fluttering. It all seems to point back to those fava beans, doesn’t it? It sounds crazy, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound crazy at all, Mande. In fact, what you're describing is raising a specific concern. Have you ever been told you have a low red blood cell count, or anemia?
PATIENT: I… I don't think so, Doctor. I've had blood tests before, for general check-ups, but no one ever mentioned anything about that. I usually just get the results sent to my family doctor, and I don’t always follow up on everything. Do you think that’s what this could be? The anemia? I don’t really know what that even is, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, anemia means you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells, and that can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, and even yellowing of the skin. What you’re describing, combined with the connection to fava beans, is suggestive of a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where people are deficient in an enzyme, and fava beans can trigger a breakdown of red blood cells. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. A physical exam and blood tests… yes, please. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. Favism… I’ve never heard of that before. It’s good to finally have some idea of what might be happening. I’m a little worried, but I’m glad we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. I'll also look at your skin and the whites of your eyes to assess the yellowing. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect at this time. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I do notice some mild scleral icterus – that’s yellowing of the whites of your eyes. And your skin has a slightly pale tone. Now, let's move on to the blood tests. I'll order a complete blood count to check your red blood cell count, and a reticulocyte count, which tells us how your body is making new red blood cells. We'll also check your liver enzymes and bilirubin levels to get a better overall picture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly okay, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough exam. So, a CBC, reticulocyte count, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels… I’ll remember that. Hopefully, the tests will give us some answers. Will I need to fast for any of them? Or is there anything I should do before I come back?
DOCTOR: Good question. Yes, for the most accurate results, I would like you to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Also, please avoid strenuous exercise the day before the test. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding fava beans completely. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. No fava beans. That’s… actually quite easy, to be honest. I’ll avoid them completely. Fasting for 8-12 hours and no strenuous exercise… I can definitely do that. Thank you for the instructions, Doctor. And for explaining everything so patiently. It’s put my mind at ease a little, knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. Here, let me just grab my purse…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. It's always best to be proactive about your health. The lab is located just down the street at [address of lab]. They don’t require an appointment, but it's always a good idea to call ahead to check their hours. Here's the requisition form, and my card with the clinic number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. We'll get these results back quickly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been wonderfully thorough. I’ll call the lab and schedule the blood work as soon as possible. And I’ll definitely call the clinic if anything comes up. Thank you again for your time and your help. It’s a relief to know what steps to take. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help. Remember, avoiding fava beans until we have the results is the most important thing right now. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out. .
