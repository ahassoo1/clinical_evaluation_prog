DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… it’s just these pains. Down low, you see. They come and go, but when they do come… well, it’s quite something. I believe I’ve been having them for a little while now, but it’s hard to say exactly when they started. My memory isn’t what it used to be, unfortunately. They mentioned something about… SLE, when I scheduled the appointment? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Glymph, I see here there's a note regarding a possible Systemic Lupus Erythematosus diagnosis. We'll certainly address that. But let's focus on these pains for now. Could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Lupus… yes, that rings a bell, vaguely. It’s all a bit of a muddle, you understand. The pains… well, they’re a cramping sort of ache. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More… a heavy pressure, really. And it feels… deep inside. Sometimes it radiates to my back, a little. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes in waves, I suppose. Though, lately, they’ve been… more frequent, perhaps? I’m not certain. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Glymph. "Cramping ache, heavy pressure, radiating to the back, intermittent, with increasing frequency." Now, when these pains occur, are you noticing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, when the pain is bad. And a little nauseous, perhaps. Not enough to be sick, just a queasy feeling. Oh, and… fatigue. I'm always tired, of course, but it seems worse when these episodes happen. I just feel… drained. And… is it normal to feel… a little anxious when this is happening? It worries me, naturally. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Bloating, nausea, fatigue… and anxiety accompanying the pain. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bowel… habits? That… that's a bit personal, isn't it? Well, let me see… I suppose… sometimes I've been a little constipated, yes. It's not regular, mind you. And other times… well, the opposite. It’s rather unpredictable, really. I haven’t been keeping close track, I'm afraid. It's just… one of those things, you know? I’m not sure if that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Glymph. Changes in bowel habits, alongside the other symptoms you’ve described, are certainly noteworthy. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you know if you’ve ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well, aside from this… Lupus, I’m quite certain I’ve had high blood pressure for some time. The doctor… someone prescribed me something for it, years ago. I think it started with an ‘A’… Amlodipine? Or something similar. I’ve been taking it on and off, to be honest. I forget sometimes. And… I had a bad bout of pneumonia, many years ago. But that was a long time ago, and I fully recovered. I don't recall anything else significant. Honestly, I wish I could remember more clearly. It’s rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, I see that listed. And a history of pneumonia. It is important to maintain consistent medication for your blood pressure, Ms. Glymph. Inconsistent treatment can lead to complications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries. Let me think… Goodness. I had my appendix out when I was very young, I believe. A very long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy. Yes, that was… sometime in my forties, I think. Perhaps thirty years ago? It was… routine, I suppose. And… I don’t believe there have been any other surgeries. I think. It's all so long ago, Doctor. I apologize for being so vague. It's not intentional, truly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a hysterectomy. Alright. Now, Ms. Glymph, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother… she suffered terribly with arthritis, you see. Very debilitating. She was in constant pain. And my sister… she had something… something with her heart. It was very sudden. She passed away quite young. I don’t recall the specifics, I’m afraid. And… my father was generally healthy, I believe. Though he did have a bad temper, which I suppose could be considered a health issue! Honestly, there wasn’t a lot of talk about illnesses when I was growing up. It was just… not something we discussed much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a cardiac event in the family. Now, Ms. Glymph, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin, years ago. A rash, I believe. But it was so long ago, it’s hard to be certain. And… I’m not fond of shellfish, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy, I suppose. It just… doesn’t agree with me. Other than that… no, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I’ve always been rather robust, really. Though lately, I haven’t been feeling very robust at all!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. We've covered quite a bit. Now, I'm going to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, palpating your abdomen, and a few other standard checks. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. I trust your judgement implicitly. Please, do whatever you feel is necessary. I'm ready whenever you are. Just… try to be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. My abdomen is rather tender at the moment.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back and relax. Breathing is somewhat diminished on the left side. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness. Abdomen is mildly distended. Reflexes are normal. Alright. I’ll need to order some blood work and a pelvic ultrasound. The ultrasound will help us visualize your uterus and ovaries. The blood work will assess for inflammation and rule out other possible causes.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. An ultrasound… and blood work. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Is it something serious, do you think? I understand you can’t say for certain, but… I'm rather anxious, naturally. Lupus… and now this… I just want to know what’s going on. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps avoid certain foods? Or… rest? Just tell me if there’s anything I can do to help.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. These tests are simply to gather more information. The possibility of Lupus needs to be investigated, certainly, and we must also rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, or even diverticulitis. For now, I recommend maintaining a bland diet – avoid spicy or fatty foods. Hydrate well, and try to get as much rest as possible. But most importantly, please avoid strenuous activity until we have a clearer picture. We'll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Glymph. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that is very reassuring to hear. Bland diet… and rest. I can manage that, I believe. And I will certainly avoid any strenuous activity. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with my… vagueness. It’s just… frustrating, not remembering things. But… I trust you implicitly. Please, do let me know as soon as you have the results. And thank you again, Doctor Gonzalezperez.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Glymph. The lab results should be available in approximately three to five business days. My staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are in. Now, if there are no further questions, you are free to go.
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll await your call. Have a good day, Doctor Gonzalezperez.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Glymph.
