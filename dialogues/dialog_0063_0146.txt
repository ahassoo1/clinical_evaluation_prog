DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, straight to it. It’s my muscles, mostly. They feel… weak. Like they’re not doing what I tell them to, if that makes sense. It’s been getting worse for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. Vague descriptions are… unhelpful, Mr. McKinnon. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Unhelpful, yeah, I get that. Sorry. Okay, let me think… It's not like a sudden thing, more like… everything takes effort. Lifting things, even just getting up from a chair. My arms and legs feel it the most, I guess. And sometimes my hands feel clumsy, like I can’t grip things properly. Does that… help? It’s definitely not a pain thing, just… gone. Like the strength’s been turned down.
DOCTOR: “Gone”, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the best way I can put it. It’s not cramping, or aching, or anything like that. Just… less. Like when a battery’s running low, you know? Everything works, but it takes more to get it going. It's mostly on both sides, not just one arm or leg. And it’s been pretty consistent, day to day.
DOCTOR: Consistent weakness… Very well. And how long precisely has this “low battery” sensation been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the middle of July. Maybe the 15th? It was gradual, so I didn’t really notice it at first. Just thought I was tired. But it’s definitely worse now than it was then. I'd say it's been steadily getting worse for about two, maybe three weeks, like I said. I work a lot, so I figured it was just stress. But it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Stress. Of course. And what exactly do you do for work, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: I’m an insurance appraiser. Auto damage, mostly. I go out to car accidents, look at the damage, figure out how much it’ll cost to fix ‘em. Lots of driving, lots of walking around looking at smashed metal. Sometimes I gotta get under cars, stuff like that. It's physical, you know? And it’s not always a nice office job; sometimes I'm dealing with… difficult people.
DOCTOR: Difficult people… and physical exertion. Do you have any family history of… neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological… uh, not that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. My dad was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be 85. No one ever talked about anything like… muscle problems, or anything like that. We weren't really a family that talked about health much, to be honest. Just, you know, dealt with things as they came. I don't think so, though. I'd remember something like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't really taken much in the way of medication, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but nothing regular. No reactions, nothing like that. I’m pretty careful about what I put in my body, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing at all. I really don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Just… nothing. I tried a multivitamin for a bit last year, but I stopped after a couple of weeks. Didn't seem to do anything. Really, nothing. I'm pretty sure of it.
DOCTOR: Let's move on. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Please sit up straight on the examination table. I’ll need you to follow my instructions precisely. First, can you grip my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, yeah, no problem. Straight to it, I get that. Here you go. Squeeze as hard as I can… I’ll try. I haven't been doing much with my hands lately, to be honest. They just feel… weak, like I said.
DOCTOR: Weak, as you say. Now, please interlock your fingers and pull against my resistance.
PATIENT: Okay… pulling… it’s… harder than it should be, I think. It's not a strong pull, if that makes sense. I feel like I should be able to do more. It feels… strained. Like something's about to give.
DOCTOR: Strained, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, strained. Like I'm using muscles I shouldn't have to. It’s not a painful strain, just… effortful. Like trying to pull something heavy, but it's not actually that heavy. It's weird. I'm used to doing this sort of thing. My job, remember? I'm always lifting and pulling things. It's just… not the same now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, relaxing… I'm not a fan of these things, to be honest. Always worried something's gonna pop. But, yeah, relaxed as I can be. Go ahead. Just let me know if it's gonna be a hard tap, alright? I'm a bit jumpy.
DOCTOR: Diminished, but present. Now, please try to stand up and walk for me. I’m looking for any instability or unusual gait.
PATIENT: Alright. Okay, walking… It feels… normal, I guess. But I'm being careful, to be honest. I don't want to trip. It feels like I have to… concentrate on each step. Like I'm trying to remember how to walk. I don't usually think about it this much. Is something obviously wrong?
DOCTOR: Subtle shuffling. We will need to run some blood work, Mr. McKinnon. I suspect there may be an underlying deficiency. I’ll also order a vitamin D level and a complete metabolic panel. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule things out. .
PATIENT: Alright, yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood work, vitamin levels… whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s just… unsettling, this weakness. It’s not like me. Okay, so what do I need to do? Where do I go? Do I need to fast beforehand? I'm terrible with these things, I always forget something.
