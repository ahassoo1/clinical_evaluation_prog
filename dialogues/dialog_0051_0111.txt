DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s…well, my skin. It’s gotten darker, and I tire easily. It’s quite bothersome, really. I expect a swift diagnosis and solution.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. We'll certainly try to be efficient. Darkening skin and fatigue... alright. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice? It feels like…a while. Months, certainly. Perhaps longer. It’s all rather muddled, you see. I do a great deal of physical labor, reinforcing iron, so it's difficult to pinpoint. I've been doing that work for…well, a very long time. It's hardly a new development.
DOCTOR: Right, reinforcing iron. That’s good to know. And has the darkening skin been all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Everywhere! It’s not as if I’ve only darkened on my elbows, you know. It’s…a general discoloration. A rather unpleasant hue, I might add. And it’s accompanied by this persistent weariness. Frankly, it’s interfering with my work. Though, I’m sure you’ll find that hard to believe; I’m a strong man. I was a strong man.
DOCTOR: I understand. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? Life changes, Doctor. The world changes. But I haven’t changed. Well, perhaps I’m a bit slower now, but that’s simply the inevitable march of time. No, nothing of significance. My wife is still…my wife. We eat the same meals. I go to work. I come home. It’s a simple life. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging the mundane?
DOCTOR: We are, Mr. Drahota. I just want to get a complete picture. Sometimes even seemingly small changes can be important. Now, let’s talk about your wife's health. Has she been well?
PATIENT: My wife’s health? What does her health have to do with my darkening skin and fatigue? This is…impertinent. She’s fine. Perfectly fine. A bit frail, perhaps, but she’s lived a long life. We don’t trouble doctors unless absolutely necessary. Are you suggesting something, Doctor? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Please don’t be alarmed, Mr. Drahota. I apologize if my question seemed out of place. I was simply trying to rule out any potential shared environmental factors or concerns. Sometimes illnesses can present similarly in family members. It's routine. Now, let’s move on to your diet. You mentioned eating the same meals. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Routine. Everyone speaks of routine. Very well. Breakfast is typically congee, with a bit of preserved vegetable. Lunch is…whatever my wife prepares. Usually rice with some sort of meat or fish. And dinner is much the same. We don't indulge in…frivolous foods. It's a practical diet. Nourishing, if somewhat bland. Are we finished yet? I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, congee, rice with meat or fish… thank you. And do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Vitamins? Good heavens, no. I get all the nourishment I need from my food. And from hard work, of course. These…modern concoctions…they’re unnecessary. A waste of money, if you ask me. My father lived to be ninety without a single vitamin in his life. I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly healthy, despite this…discoloration. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. Perhaps a quick examination would be helpful. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won’t take long. If you don't mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps take a look at your skin more closely?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with. But be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And don't poke and prod too much; I'm not made of stone. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, though a little quiet. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your breathing sounds a little shallow, and the sounds are a bit quieter than usual on both sides. Now, as for your skin, I can see the darkening you mentioned. It's quite widespread. It also feels a little cool. I'm also noting some slight dryness. Do you experience any itching or discomfort with your skin?
PATIENT: Itching? No, not really. A bit of…tightness, perhaps. Especially in the evenings. But nothing unbearable. Just…old age, I suppose. Dry skin comes with getting older. It’s hardly a medical marvel. And as for the coolness…well, I’ve always been a bit chilly. I prefer a warm room, if you must know. Are you finished poking and prodding yet, Doctor? This is quite undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Just a few more quick questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: My…bowel habits? Good heavens! Are you serious? This is…this is outrageous! I came to you complaining of darkening skin and fatigue, not to discuss my…personal matters! I refuse to answer that question. This consultation is over. I want a referral to someone else. Immediately. This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I apologize if my questions were intrusive. It seems I've upset you, and that was not my intention. I understand you would like a referral. I can certainly arrange that. Given your concerns about fatigue and skin changes, and your reluctance to discuss further details, I recommend a consultation with a dermatologist and a hematologist. They can perform more specialized tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. I will also provide you with a list of local specialists. And while we await those appointments, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as significant weakness, shortness of breath, or severe bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Mr. Drahota?
