DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become frequent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it seems to radiate a bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Numbness, you say. And primarily in the left leg, with some occasional radiation. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. More like… a pins-and-needles sensation, but duller. And sometimes just a feeling of… coldness, even when the leg isn’t actually cold. It isn’t constant, it comes and goes. It's difficult to explain precisely.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Pins and needles," a dull ache, and coldness… intermittent, you said. Right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: It started, I believe, sometime in early June. At first, it was very infrequent, maybe once a week, and I dismissed it as just sitting awkwardly. But over the last month, it’s become more regular. Now it’s almost daily, and occasionally multiple times a day. I can recall the exact dates if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, no need for precise dates at this moment. “Almost daily” is sufficient. And is there anything in particular that seems to trigger these episodes, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I've been trying to pay attention to that. It seems to be worse after I've been sitting for a long period, especially working on animation. Standing up and walking around usually helps, at least temporarily. I also noticed it’s a bit worse when I’m tired. I don’t know if those are related, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, prolonged sitting, particularly during animation work, exacerbates it, and standing and walking provides some relief. And fatigue seems to play a role as well. Do you experience any pain alongside the numbness?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… ache, deep in the thigh. It doesn't happen every time I experience the numbness, but often accompanies it. It’s usually mild, though. Nothing debilitating, but definitely noticeable. I can describe the location more precisely if you'd like.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. And can you characterize the ache – is it constant, throbbing, burning, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s located mostly in the front of my thigh, kind of in the middle. As for the character… I would describe it as a dull, persistent ache. Not sharp, definitely not burning. It's not a throbbing pain, either. More like… a heavy feeling, if that makes sense. It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. It doesn’t really feel like a muscle ache, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Dull, persistent ache in the anterior thigh, not throbbing, not burning, and not a typical muscle ache. I see. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been fairly healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant. I don't take any medications regularly, nor do I have any allergies. I had a routine check-up about two years ago, and everything was normal then. I can provide the details of my primary care physician if necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No significant medical history, no medications, no allergies. Let's discuss your family history. Are there any neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, or any other conditions affecting the nerves, in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. To my knowledge, no. My mother’s side of the family is relatively healthy, though she does have some arthritis. My father’s side… I recall my grandfather having some issues with his hands later in life, something about weakness, but I don’t believe it was ever formally diagnosed. It wasn’t a prominent part of his health history, as far as I know. I can inquire with my mother if you would like a more detailed response.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Arthritis in your mother, and some unspecified hand weakness in your grandfather. We'll keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a special effects artist and animator, primarily from home. So, I spend a considerable amount of time sitting at a computer. I try to exercise regularly—usually hiking or walking—when I’m not working, maybe three or four times a week. I don’t smoke, and I drink alcohol only occasionally, socially. I maintain a healthy diet, generally. I wouldn’t classify myself as particularly sedentary, despite the nature of my profession.
DOCTOR: Right. Primarily sedentary work, but with an attempt to maintain a healthy lifestyle through exercise. Let's perform a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with neurological assessment of your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or if you need me to adjust my position.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your leg. Reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally. Now, let's assess your strength. Can you resist as I push against your leg?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m relaxed. Yes, I can resist. I'm applying force, trying to keep my leg still. Just let me know if you need me to push harder or change anything.
DOCTOR: Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in all major muscle groups. Now, let's check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your leg with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Sensation is… intact, though slightly diminished distally in the left lower leg. Now, let's assess your gait. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is there anything specific you are looking for? I'm walking at a normal pace now. Please let me know if you want me to speed up or slow down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gait appears normal, no noticeable limp or asymmetry. However, I did note the slight diminished sensation distally in your left lower leg during the sensory assessment. Based on your history and this limited physical examination, the differential diagnosis includes peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and possibly early signs of compression. However, more information is needed. I’m going to order some blood work, including a CBC, CMP, vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid panel to rule out any systemic causes. I would also like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to assess for nerve root compression. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Blood work and an MRI seem reasonable given the information we've discussed. I'm happy to proceed with those tests. Would you like me to schedule them directly, or will my primary care physician be involved in the scheduling? Also, could you briefly explain what each test is looking for, just so I have a better understanding?
DOCTOR: Good. I will write the orders now and you can schedule them at the front desk. The CBC and CMP are standard blood tests to evaluate your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to the neuropathy. The vitamin B12 level will assess if a deficiency is present, as B12 deficiency can cause nerve damage. The thyroid panel is also important, as thyroid dysfunction can sometimes mimic neuropathic symptoms. The MRI of the lumbar spine will give us a detailed view of your spinal nerves and look for any compression or inflammation that could be causing your symptoms. It's a precautionary measure at this point, but important to rule out structural causes. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that explanation is very clear, Doctor. Thank you. I understand the purpose of each test and why you’re recommending them. I’ll schedule those at the front desk right now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave, or any precautions I should take before the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. No, there are no specific precautions before the tests, just try to remain hydrated. Once you have the results, you can have your primary care physician forward them to my office, or you can bring them with you during your follow-up appointment. I’d like to see you back in about two weeks, or sooner if your symptoms worsen significantly. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged sitting if possible, and continue with your regular exercise routine as tolerated. If you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or bowel or bladder dysfunction, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your thorough examination and clear explanations. I appreciate your time and I'll schedule the tests and follow up as suggested. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I’ll see you in two weeks. Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day as well.
