DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Farson. Nicky, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicky Farson. And please, Doctor… Overgaard, was it? Don’t bother with the “Mr.” I’m not that old, despite what these aches and pains might tell you. I just want to figure out what’s going on with all this bruising. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, bruising isn’t typically desirable. So, let’s get to the bottom of it. You say “all this bruising” – can you tell me where you're bruising, and how long it's been happening?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly on my arms, you see. And my legs, a bit. It’s not like I’m walking into walls or anything. It started… oh, I’d say about a month ago, maybe a little longer. It just… appeared. Didn't really pay much attention at first, thought I just bumped into something. But it keeps happening, even when I'm careful. It's a bit ridiculous, honestly. And it's quite dark, if that makes any difference. I used to be a very… robust man, you know. This isn’t like me.
DOCTOR: A month, consistently. And dark bruising… Right. And you’ve said you haven’t experienced any trauma that you recall?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, Doctor. I haven’t been in a fight with anyone, if that’s what you’re implying. I’m a pathologist, not a… a bouncer. I spend my days looking at slides, not throwing punches. It's just… appearing. Like someone's painting me with a bruise brush. Honestly, it's getting quite bothersome. It makes me look… unwell.
DOCTOR: A pathologist. Right. So, no recent falls, no new activities, no changes in your routine that might explain it?
PATIENT: Changes in routine? Well… my wife passed away last year. That was… a change. A rather significant one, if you ask me. But I hardly think grief causes bruising, Doctor. Unless I’m subconsciously beating myself up, which… isn’t entirely outside the realm of possibility, I suppose. But no, no physical changes. I still go to the lab, still look at the same slides. I’ve just… cut back on socializing, if that’s what you mean. It's quiet, these days. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: I understand loss is… significant. But we need to focus on the physical symptoms, Mr. Farson. Grief can certainly affect health, but bruising usually has a more… concrete cause. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Yes, well, there’s the blood thinner, of course. The doctor prescribed it after… a little episode. A clot, they said. Something to do with my legs. And… let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, but that’s about it. A small dose. Nothing… dramatic. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I eat my plain toast, I read my reports, I avoid excitement. I hardly think that’s a recipe for mysterious bruising. Is that blood thinner causing this, then? It’s always the simplest explanation, isn't it?
DOCTOR: The blood thinner is certainly a possibility, and a very relevant one. What's the name of it, and what dosage are you on?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wouldn’t know the name if it bit me. They just tell me to take one pill in the morning. A little blue one. And another little blue one at night. That's all I know. One in the morning, one at night. The dosage… it's on the bottle, I suppose. But I haven't bothered to look. My housekeeper usually manages those things. I trust her to handle it. She’s very organized. Really, you’d think they could just tell me these things when they prescribe it, wouldn't you? It's all a bit… haphazard, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to find that information, Mr. Farson. And I strongly advise you become familiar with your medications. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to assess the bruising and check for any other concerning signs. Can you roll up your sleeves and loosen your trousers a bit?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But don't expect miracles. I'm not exactly a specimen of robust health these days. And please, be gentle. My skin is rather… sensitive. Honestly, this whole thing is rather undignified. I'm a pathologist, not… a patient. Though, I suppose I am a patient, at the moment. Get it over with, Doctor. I have reports to review.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting bruising on both arms, varying in size and coloration. Some appears relatively new, some older. And on the legs… similar pattern. No signs of any recent injury or swelling. Skin is thin, as you mentioned. Capillary refill appears normal. Do you experience any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like a bruise, really. But it’s not debilitating, if that’s what you’re asking. It's mostly… unsettling. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I'm being poked and prodded like some… specimen. Which, I suppose, is ironic, given my profession. Do you think it's serious? I do have a rather important case, you know. Can’t be spending weeks recovering from a simple bruise.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present and normal. Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary exam, the bruising is concerning, but not immediately life-threatening. The blood thinner is definitely a key factor, and we need to investigate that further. I'm going to order a complete blood count , a coagulation panel , and a basic metabolic panel . The CBC will tell us about your overall blood health. The coagulation panel will assess how well your blood is clotting—specifically, the effect of the blood thinner. And the BMP will check your kidney function, as that can affect medication metabolism.
PATIENT: A complete blood… what now? And a coagulation… panel? Honestly, Doctor, you’re speaking a foreign language. Can't you just tell me why I’m bruising? Is it serious? Will I have to stop taking this… pill? I have a responsibility, you know. I can’t just… stop taking medication without knowing the consequences. This is all rather… overwhelming. Are you sure there isn't something else it could be? Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? Or… I don't know… something exotic? I did travel to Belize once, years ago…
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your concern, but I need information to make an accurate diagnosis. The tests I've ordered will give me that information. We’re ruling things out systematically. While a vitamin deficiency is possible, it's less likely given the context of the blood thinner. The Belize trip… is not immediately relevant unless you had specific symptoms while you were there. Right now, the most plausible explanation is related to the medication, and the tests will confirm or deny that. I will also order a urinalysis. We’ll check for any signs of kidney involvement. And I'm going to recommend you stop taking the blue pill until we get the results back. It’s a temporary measure, and it's better to be safe than sorry. I'm going to write you a prescription for a temporary anticoagulant if you experience any concerning symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or excessive bleeding. Here are the requisitions. You can get these done at the lab downstairs. They're open until 5 PM. Please bring the results back to me as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Stop taking the pill… just like that? What if something happens while I'm not taking it? And a temporary… what-now? Honestly, this is a disaster. Fine. Fine! I'll go get these tests done. But if anything goes wrong, I'm holding you responsible, Doctor. I suppose I should ask… how long will these tests take? And what exactly am I looking for when I bring the results back? A specific number? A color? This is all very… unhelpful. .
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. When you bring them back, the lab report itself will have a reference range listed for each value. We're looking at the PT/INR value specifically—it measures how long your blood takes to clot. The normal range is usually between 0.8 and 1.1. If your value is significantly above that, it indicates you're over-anticoagulated, and that could be causing the bruising. And, of course, any other abnormalities will be flagged on the report. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then, go to the emergency room. Here's that information. And I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. But this is a necessary process to ensure your safety. Please follow the instructions carefully.
