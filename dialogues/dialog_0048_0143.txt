DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Smith Verrall. It’s… nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it? I think that’s what the paper says. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sink. And you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well… the lady on the phone, she said something about… getting ready? Before… before a baby comes? I’m not quite sure I understand everything. It’s my… my friend, she wants a baby, and she thought I should come talk to someone first. Is that right? I feel a bit lost, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A baby?
PATIENT: Yes. My friend… she wants to have a baby. And she thought… well, she thought it was a good idea for me to come and talk to you before… before things get started. I don’t really know what “getting started” means, exactly. She said something about making sure everything is okay… for the baby? And… and for me, I suppose. It’s all a bit new.
DOCTOR: So, let me get this straight. Your friend wants a baby, and she’s sent you to see me?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds about right. She… she wants a baby with someone else, you see. And she thought I should come. She said… something about… family history? And… and making sure I’m healthy enough. I’m not sure why she sent me specifically. I just… I want to be supportive. I hope that makes sense. I don't want to cause any trouble, or be a problem.
DOCTOR: Right. So you’re here as… a potential relative?
PATIENT: Potential… relative? I… I suppose so, yes. She’s a very close friend. We’ve known each other a long time. She just said it was best if I talked to a doctor first. She worries a lot. I… I don’t understand why I need to see a doctor, though. Is it normal to see a doctor before a baby is even… happening? I thought doctors were for when you were sick, or… or when the baby was already born.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, this is rather… unusual. Are you aware of any genetic conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Genetic… conditions? Hmm. That’s… a good question. My family… they came from Kurdistan, a long time ago. I don’t… I don’t really know much about family medical history. My parents… they didn’t talk about things like that. And I haven’t… I haven’t really kept track, I’m afraid. Old country, you see. Things were different then. I just know… my grandmother, she had trouble with her bones, maybe? And my uncle… he was always sick, but I don’t remember what with. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Vague family history. Alright. Let’s try this another way. Do you have any medical problems?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I get a bit tired sometimes, but that’s just from getting older, I think. And my knees ache a bit in the cold weather. Nothing serious, though. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I mostly just try to stay active and eat healthy. I don’t take any medicines regularly. I try to avoid them, if I can. Does that make sense? I'm not sure what you're looking for exactly.
DOCTOR: So, no significant medical history, and a very limited understanding of your family's health. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that are concerning you?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not really. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little forgetful, as I said, but that’s just age, isn't it? And sometimes I get a bit… winded, if I climb too many stairs. But that’s it, really. I feel… okay. I don't want to waste your time, Doctor. I'm starting to wonder if my friend sent me to the wrong place. Maybe she thought I was someone else?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, this is… a peculiar situation. It appears your friend is seeking pre-conception counseling, and has inexplicably sent you. Given your lack of relevant medical history, and the unusual nature of this request… I'm not entirely sure what I can do for you. Perhaps your friend should be the one attending these appointments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I think I'm starting to understand. She sent me because… maybe she thought I had some kind of… information she needed? About my family, or something? But I don’t! I feel terrible. I just wanted to be helpful. You're right, she should be here. She's the one who… wants the baby. I'm so sorry I've wasted your time. Is it okay if I tell her to come herself? I feel like I'm making things very confusing. I apologize, Doctor. Truly. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verrall. That would be the most sensible course of action. Please advise your friend to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And frankly, perhaps a referral to a genetic counselor would be beneficial for her as well. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
