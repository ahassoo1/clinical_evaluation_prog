DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, um… a letter. Something about a pet, I think? Honestly, my ex-husband handled most of that stuff. I just need a piece of paper to… prove I can have one, I guess. It’s for the apartment complex. They’re being difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you need documentation related to pet ownership for your apartment complex. While that’s not typically something handled within a medical setting, I'm happy to see if I can assist in any way I can. To clarify, is this documentation specifically related to a medical need – perhaps an emotional support animal, or a service animal?
PATIENT: Emotional…support? Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. It’s just a dog. A lovely little poodle mix. Perfectly healthy, I assume. He doesn’t need a doctor. I just… they want a letter from a doctor, saying I’m responsible enough to have a pet. It’s ridiculous, really. He’s better behaved than most people I know.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the apartment complex requires a letter confirming your ability to responsibly care for a pet, and they're requesting it from a medical professional. That’s… unusual, but I can see how it’s causing a challenge. Just to be certain, and for my records, could you confirm your date of birth for me, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with those. Let me think… um… July 14th. 1981, I believe. Yes, that sounds right. Though, honestly, don't quote me on that. It's been a while since anyone asked.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wrye. July 14th, 1981. I have that noted. Now, while I usually provide medical care, and this request is outside of that scope, I can certainly offer some perspective. To help me understand the situation a little better, and perhaps draft a letter stating you are of sound mind and capable of responsible pet ownership – though please understand this is not a standard medical document – could you tell me a bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: Oh, "living situation"... Well, it's an apartment. A nice one, actually. Two bedrooms. Plenty of space for the little guy. It’s… quiet. Mostly. The neighbors are… present. I keep to myself, mostly. I'm divorced, so it's just me now. He's good company, you know? Keeps me from being lonely.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you’ve created a comfortable home for yourself and your dog. To clarify, have you experienced any recent significant life changes or stressors, aside from the divorce, that might impact your ability to provide consistent care for your pet?
PATIENT: Stressors? Well, the divorce was a stressor. Still is, sometimes. And dealing with the apartment complex is definitely stressful. They’re… particular. Beyond that… no, not really. I’m retired, thankfully. So I have plenty of time. I just wish they’d leave me alone about the letter. Honestly, it’s insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. It does sound quite irritating to have to jump through hoops like this. To ensure I have a comprehensive understanding, and to be able to draft a letter that is both helpful and accurate, could you briefly describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Routine? Well... I wake up, usually around 8. Coffee, of course. Then I take the dog for a walk. He likes a good long walk. After that, I might do some reading, or watch a bit of television. I like documentaries. Or call my sister. She lives in Atlanta. Evenings are pretty quiet. Cook dinner, relax with the dog. It's... uneventful, mostly. Is that what you needed? It's not very exciting, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like a peaceful and stable routine, which is good. Now, just to rule out any potential underlying factors that might be relevant, even if you don't perceive them as significant, have you had any recent changes in your memory or cognitive function?
PATIENT: Memory? Well, I forget things. Everyone forgets things, don't they? Like... what I had for breakfast yesterday. Or the name of that actress… you know, the one who’s always in those rom-coms? It’s not bad, just… normal. I wouldn’t say it’s changed recently. Just... getting older, I suppose. My ex-husband used to say I was always a bit scatterbrained.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. Occasional forgetfulness is common, especially as we age. It sounds like your memory is generally consistent with what you'd expect. To be thorough, and just to ensure there aren't any other contributing factors, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Mood? Hmm... well, the apartment thing is annoying, so I'm a bit grumpy about that. But overall... I'm fine. I'm a bit lonely sometimes, but the dog helps with that. Energy levels... good enough. I don't run marathons, if that's what you're asking. But I can walk the dog, and do my grocery shopping. It's not like I'm spending all day in bed, if that's what you mean. Honestly, I'm just tired of having to explain myself.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your openness, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you're managing well, and that you've created a comfortable life for yourself, despite some understandable frustrations. Based on our conversation today, it does not appear that there are any medical concerns that would prevent you from responsibly caring for your pet. I can draft a letter stating that you are of sound mind, capable of making informed decisions, and appear to be fully capable of providing adequate care for your dog. However, please be aware that this letter is not a standard medical document and the apartment complex may still require additional documentation. Would you like me to proceed with drafting that letter?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Thank you. Honestly, just having something in writing might be enough to make them leave me alone. And... thank you for listening. It’s nice to be able to just talk about it, really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. This letter states that you are of sound mind and appear capable of providing adequate care for your pet. I've also included a sentence mentioning that you do not appear to have any cognitive or mental health concerns that would impact your ability to care for an animal. Please review it to ensure it accurately reflects our conversation. I’ll also provide you with a copy for your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
