DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’m not really sure why I had to come in. It's just…this diarrhea. It won't stop. I've tried everything the drugstore sells, and it's still happening. It’s been going on for…well, too long. And frankly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's definitely frustrating when something like that persists, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It is something we can help with. “Too long” is a little vague – could you give me a rough estimate of how many days this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Let's see…about ten days, maybe? I lost track after the fifth, to be honest. It’s not like I'm keeping a calendar for bathroom trips. And it's not just a little upset stomach, you know? It’s…bad. Several times a day. I'm just…tired of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten days of frequent diarrhea. That is significant. And I appreciate you being honest about how disruptive it is. Has there been anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well, nothing makes it better. Nothing I've tried, anyway. As for worse…spicy food, obviously. Dairy doesn't help. I tried cutting out gluten, didn't change a thing. Honestly, it feels pretty random. I eat something plain, and sometimes it's still awful. It’s just…unpredictable, and that's what’s so annoying.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no real dietary triggers that you’ve been able to identify consistently. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…weak. And thirsty, obviously. I’m constantly trying to rehydrate, but it just…goes right through me. I haven’t had a fever or anything. No stomach cramps, just…emptiness, and then that. It's just this constant…rush. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cramping, just weakness and increased thirst with the diarrhea. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Really? You have to ask me that? Of course I’ve looked. No, no blood. It’s just…liquid. A lot of it. I'm not an idiot, Doctor. I know what’s normal and what’s not, and this is definitely not normal. Do we have to go through every single detail? It’s embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Woodring. It’s important to rule out certain things, and I don’t mean to imply anything. I understand this is uncomfortable to discuss, and I assure you, it’s all part of trying to figure out what's going on. It's just standard procedure. Let’s move on. Have you had any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Just…this. I haven’t thrown up, but I feel sick to my stomach sometimes, just…a general queasiness. Like I might, but it never happens. And I haven't had a fever, like I said before. I’m just tired of being glued to the bathroom, that's all. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. No vomiting, just occasional nausea alongside the diarrhea. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Now we get to that. Honestly, it's not much. I was healthy, perfectly healthy, until my husband…well, until he passed. Stress, I guess. But I haven’t been to a doctor in…years. I don’t really have any conditions. No allergies, nothing. And I don’t take any medications. Just…this. And the grief, obviously. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy prior to your husband's passing, no known allergies or medications, and you attribute the start of this to stress related to grief. Grief certainly can manifest physically. And just to confirm, you haven't had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I've been perfectly healthy. Look, I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but I really think it’s just…a bad reaction to stress. Maybe I need a vacation. Or a really strong cup of tea. Can we just…rule that out and give me something to stop it? I'm sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. I understand your desire for a quick resolution, Ms. Woodring, and I certainly want to help you feel better. However, given that this has been going on for ten days, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, even if it is related to stress. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your abdomen and checking for dehydration. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t poke around too much. And please tell me you washed your hands. I don't need a cold on top of this. Honestly, it’s just ridiculous. All this fuss over a little…stomach trouble. But hurry up, okay? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Woodring. And I understand your frustration. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. Your abdomen sounds…slightly hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. And your skin does seem a little less elastic than it should be, indicating mild dehydration. I don’t feel any obvious tenderness or masses. I think it would be a good idea to run a stool sample, just to rule out any infections or parasites. And a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function. Would you be able to collect a sample before you leave?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You’re going to make me collect…that? Look, I already told you, it’s just stress. I don’t need a lab test to tell me I’m stressed. But fine. If you insist. Where am I supposed to…do this? And is there somewhere I can wash my hands afterwards? This is just…humiliating. I really think you’re overreacting. But get it over with, okay? I want this done as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for having to ask. There’s a bathroom just down the hall, and we have collection kits available. The lab will provide specific instructions. It's a standard procedure to rule out other potential causes, and it will give us a clearer picture. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend an oral hydration solution to help replenish your electrolytes. And a bland diet – things like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast – to give your digestive system a break. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. Just…get me the kit. And tell me how long this is going to take. I have things to do, you know? And honestly, I think I just need a good night’s sleep and a strong cup of tea. This is all very…unnecessary. But fine, I’ll do the test. Just hurry up. I want to get out of here as quickly as possible. And please don't ask me any more…personal questions. It's embarrassing enough as it is. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please follow the recommendations I’ve given you regarding hydration and diet. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or signs of severe dehydration – please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
