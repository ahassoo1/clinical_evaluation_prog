DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. Why don't we start with you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… uh… I want to know more about where my people come from. My grandkids, they ask a lot of questions, you see. About before, long time ago. I think… a test? To see where we come from, with the… the spit? I hear they can do that now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestry, and you've heard about ancestry testing – the one using saliva, I presume. That’s certainly something a lot of people are curious about these days. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any health concerns that brought you in today, or is this solely to explore your family history?
PATIENT: No, no health problems, Doctor. Just… curious. My grandkids, they live in America now, far away. They want to know about the islands, about our story. I want to tell them good story, you see? Not just… old man stories. Real stories. The spit test… that’s what I heard. Will it tell me where my people really come from?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s wonderful. It's great you want to connect with your grandchildren that way. The ancestry tests, also known as direct-to-consumer genetic tests, can provide information about your ethnic origins. They analyze your DNA and compare it to reference populations from around the world. However, it’s important to understand what those tests can and cannot tell you. They can give you a percentage breakdown of your likely ancestry, but it’s not always completely accurate, and it doesn’t give you a complete picture of your family's history. The reference populations they use aren't exhaustive, especially for specific island nations like the Marshall Islands. It can be a good starting point, but it’s not a substitute for traditional genealogical research and oral histories. Before we talk about potentially ordering a test, let’s talk a little about your family history as you know it. Do you know where in the Marshall Islands your family is originally from?
PATIENT: That… that’s good to know, Doctor. I didn't think about… not being perfect. Just want to know something. My father… he was from Majuro, I think. Big island. Mother, she was from… smaller island. Arno, maybe? It was long time ago, you see. I was just a boy. We moved around a lot. Fishing. My father, he was a fisherman. I don’t remember much about the islands, really. Just… warm water and lots of stars. And stories. Old stories. But they… fade, you know? That's why I want the test. Help me remember. Help me tell the grandkids.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. Memories do fade, and it’s wonderful you want to preserve what you can for your grandchildren. Majuro and Arno, those are beautiful islands. It’s common for families to have roots in multiple islands within the Marshall Islands. So, to clarify, you’re hoping the test will provide a more concrete understanding of your ancestry, perhaps identifying specific islands or groups your family originated from?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is right. Concrete… that’s a good word. Something I can show them. A map, maybe? Or a list of places? Not just… old man talking. You understand? And… is it expensive, this test? I don't have much money, you see. Medicare… will it pay for it?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Scobie. You want something tangible to share with your grandchildren, and that’s a very reasonable desire. Regarding the cost, these ancestry tests generally range from around $100 to $300, depending on the company and the level of detail they provide. Unfortunately, Medicare typically does not cover the cost of ancestry testing, as it’s considered a recreational, not a medically necessary, service. However, before we proceed with ordering a test, I want to make sure you understand its limitations. It can provide some insights, but it won’t give you a complete family history. Also, the accuracy for populations from the Marshall Islands might be limited due to the smaller sample sizes in their reference databases. Would you be open to exploring other resources, like genealogical websites or cultural organizations that specialize in Marshallese history and genealogy?
PATIENT: That… that is a problem. Three hundred dollar… that is a lot of fish. And you are right, Doctor. I don’t want to spend money on… not real story. Tell me… about the websites. Can I see a map on the website? Learn about Majuro? Maybe see pictures of the old houses? That… that would be good. Better than just spit, maybe. And… is it free? Or… cheap?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Scobie. Websites are a great place to start, and often they are free or much less expensive than the ancestry tests. There are several resources that focus on Marshallese history and culture. One excellent website is the Marshall Islands Project . It has a wealth of information, including historical articles, photographs, and oral histories. Another good resource is the Pacific Digital Library , which has a collection of digitized documents and images related to the Pacific Islands, including the Marshall Islands. You can find maps, photographs of traditional houses, and information about the history of Majuro on both websites. I can also provide you with a list of cultural organizations that specialize in Marshallese history and genealogy. They may have additional resources and be able to help you connect with other Marshallese families. These resources are generally free to access, although some organizations may offer paid services, like genealogical research assistance. Would you like me to print out a list of these websites and organizations for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be very good. Websites… I can look at websites. Maybe… maybe my grandkids can help me with the computer. They are good with computers. Thank you, Doctor. You… you are very helpful. Not just… sell me spit test. That is good. I think… I think this is better. Real story… not just numbers.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to explore all options, and it sounds like the websites and organizations might be a great starting point for you and your grandchildren. I’m happy to answer any further questions you might have as you explore these resources. Do you have any other health concerns I can address today, or are you all set for now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Just the websites. Thank you again. You are a good doctor. And… tell you what? If I find a good story on the websites, I will come back and tell you. About Majuro. About the old days.
DOCTOR: That sounds wonderful, Mr. Scobie. I would very much enjoy hearing your stories. Please do come back and share them with me whenever you’re ready. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy exploring those websites with your grandchildren. .
