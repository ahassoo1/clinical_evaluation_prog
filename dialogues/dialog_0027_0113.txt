DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Fazzina, you say? Hmm. Well, it's... the bathroom. I keep going to the bathroom. More than I used to, you know? It’s a nuisance, really. It interrupts things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? I go more often. That’s it. I don’t... I don’t know all the fancy medical words you doctors like. It's just... a lot. My wife, bless her heart, keeps telling me to write things down, but I forget what I was even going to write down. Honestly, it's probably just old age. Everything goes when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're here to get it checked out, regardless. And you’re right, changes can happen with age, but we want to make sure everything is as it should be. When you say “more often,” about how many times a day would you say you’re going to the bathroom now, compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. Let me think. A month ago… maybe twice before breakfast? Now… now it feels like… every hour, or close to it. My wife says I'm exaggerating, but she’s always been a practical woman. Doesn't understand a man’s discomfort. It’s just… a bother, really. I used to have more important things on my mind, managing the farm and all. Now it's just… bathroom breaks.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significantly more frequent. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. It’s not… uncomfortable, exactly. It's just... urgent. Like I have to go, even if I just went a little while ago. Makes it difficult to get anything done. I'm a farmer, Doctor. I need to be able to, well, be out there, not running back and forth. It’s embarrassing, frankly. Especially when I'm showing young folks how things are done. They think I’m losing my touch.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be frustrating and concerning. So, no pain, just a strong urge to go frequently. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Now you're asking things I don't pay attention to! I look at it, of course, just to make sure everything is... normal. But I don’t go sniffing it, Doctor. Goodness, no. And I don’t compare colors. It’s… yellow, usually. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on what I've been drinking, I suppose. My wife makes me drink plenty of water, always has. She worries about my kidneys, you see. Old family history. But I don’t think it’s kidneys, it's just… this bothersome urge. It's probably just my age, like I said. Everything slows down, everything gets… weaker.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll do a quick examination, just to rule out a few things. And I'd like to do a simple urine test, if that's alright with you. It will help us understand what's going on a little better. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine me? Oh. Well, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have things to see to, you know. And a test? Just… little cup, I presume? My wife always said I have a good bladder, strong from years of hard work. But if you think it's necessary… go ahead. Just be quick about it, Doctor. I don’t like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of the county fair.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. We'll be as quick and thorough as possible. It will be a simple physical exam of your abdomen, and yes, just a sample in a cup. I'll explain everything as we go. Let's start by having you lie down on the examination table, if you're able. And I'll get the nurse to bring a specimen cup for the urine sample. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A table, you say? My knees aren’t what they used to be. sighs It’s probably just old age. But fine, a table it is. Get it over with, I say. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can get back to… well, whatever it is I was doing. My wife will have a fit if I'm gone too long. She always makes me chamomile tea when I get back from the doctor. Says it calms my nerves. Though I don’t feel particularly nervous. Just… impatient. Get that nurse, Doctor. And be quick with that examination.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. Just relax, and we'll get through this quickly. Nurse Anya! Could you please come in and assist us with a urine sample and help Mr. Segretto onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Goodness, now another person. Well, alright. Just... don't ask me to take off my boots, I'm warning you. I've had these boots for years. Best boots a man could ask for. They're broken in just right. And don't poke around too much, Nurse Anya. I don't like being fussed over. Just get it done, please. My wife is a wonderful woman, but she worries so. The less time I spend in here, the better. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. Dr. Fazzina has instructed me to assist you with a simple urine sample and help you get comfortable. We’ll be quick, and I understand your concern about being fussed over. We'll only do what's necessary. Here's a cup, and I'll leave you a little privacy to provide a sample when you’re ready. Just let us know when you’re finished. Do you need any assistance getting onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination table… groans Alright, alright. No, I can manage. Just a little help boosting myself up, perhaps. My knees, you know. They aren’t what they used to be. And please, try not to stare. A man’s modesty, you know. It's a delicate thing. Just… let me get this over with. Hurry up and wait, I suppose. Honestly, all this fuss for a little bathroom trouble. My wife will never let me live this down. Just... get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. Take your time. We’ll be right outside when you're finished. Let us know if you need anything. Alright, Mr. Segretto, are you finished?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, yes, I'm finished. Honestly, all this waiting… it makes a man need to go even more. Here. Take it. And please, don’t hold it up to the light. A man’s dignity, you know. Just… get it to the doctor. I want this over with. Honestly, I’ve had worse days at the county fair. But this… this is a close second. Just get it over with, please. My wife is probably making that chamomile tea already. And I hate chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I understand. I’ll take this to the doctor right away. Dr. Fazzina will be in shortly to do a quick abdominal examination. He will listen to your abdomen and gently press on it to check for any tenderness. It won’t take long at all. Alright, Mr. Segretto, Dr. Fazzina is here now. He'll be right with you.
PATIENT: Here we go again. sighs Fine, examine away, Doctor. Just… be gentle. My insides aren’t as tough as they used to be. And don’t expect me to jump when you poke around. I'm an old farmer, not a spring chicken. Just get it over with, please. Honestly, I've had more comfortable experiences getting poked by a cow. Just… hurry. My wife will skin me alive if I'm gone much longer. And I really don’t want that chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then gently press on it to check for any tenderness. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain. Hmm… everything sounds normal so far. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just… a little pressure, maybe? Like a full belly after a good meal. But nothing serious. I've had worse pressure from a stubborn mule, honestly. Just… poking around. I don’t like being poked around. My insides aren’t meant for this. Just… hurry up, Doctor. I have things to do, you know. And my wife is probably already brewing that… that tea. Just get it over with, please. Honestly, I’ve had more comfortable experiences wrestling a pig. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Everything seems normal on the examination, but I'd like to review the urine sample results before we discuss a plan. Just one moment, please. Okay, the urine sample shows a slightly elevated level of white blood cells, which could indicate a mild urinary tract infection. It's not severe, but it could explain your frequent urination. Do you have a fever, or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No, no fever. And no chills. I’m as warm as a summer day, thank you very much. Just a little… bothered, maybe? Bothered by all this fuss, you know. Infection? That sounds serious. Is it… contagious? My wife wouldn’t like that. She’s a practical woman, but she worries easily. Infection… sighs Just another thing to worry about. Is it going to require… pills? I hate pills. They always make me feel sluggish. Just… what does this all mean, Doctor? Honestly, I’ve had better days shoveling manure. Just… tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, it’s good it’s not severe, and no, it’s not contagious. It’s a mild infection, easily treatable with antibiotics. Yes, it will require pills, but it’s a short course – usually about seven days. They may make you feel a little sluggish, but we can discuss ways to manage that. The good news is, we caught it early. The antibiotics should clear up the infection and resolve your frequent urination. I’m going to prescribe you a medication called Nitrofurantoin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Nitrofurantoin? Sounds like something you’d use to polish furniture, not… fix a man. But fine, if that's what you recommend. Seven days, you say? Well, alright. As long as it gets rid of this bothersome problem. And no, I don’t want to hear about side effects. I don’t need more things to worry about. Just… get me the pills, Doctor. And hopefully, they won't interfere with my chamomile tea. My wife would skin me alive if I couldn’t have my tea. Just… get me the pills. Honestly, I’ve had better days getting bitten by a mosquito. Just… get me the pills. And can I get a note for the farm supply store? I need to restock my manure spreaders. It's a long story.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’ll write you a prescription for Nitrofurantoin, and I’ll include a note explaining that you may experience mild side effects like nausea. You can take it with food to help with that. And yes, I’ll write you a note for the farm supply store. Here’s the prescription and the note. The nurse will give you instructions on how to take the medication. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… get me out of here before my wife sends out a search party. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle with the instructions. I'm an old man, not a scholar. And tell her to… sighs just keep it simple. Honestly, I’ve had better days cleaning out the chicken coop. Just… get me out of here. And remind me to thank you for not asking me to take off my boots. That would have been a disaster. Just… get me out of here. And one last thing... can I get a refill on my chamomile tea prescription? My wife will skin me alive if I run out. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I'll make a note for the nurse to provide simple instructions, and I’ll add a refill for your chamomile tea to your record. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad we could address your concerns. Get well soon, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.
