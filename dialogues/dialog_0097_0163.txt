DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s a bit of a…foolish matter, really. I’ve been experimenting with a new diet, shall we say, and I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I…go any further. It’s rather restrictive, and at my age, one tends to be a bit more cautious.
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all, Mr. Vantine! It's always wise to be cautious, especially when making changes to your diet, and even more so at 85. Restrictive diets can sometimes cause unintended consequences, so you’re right to check in. Can you tell me a little more about this diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was advertised – online, naturally – as the “Vitality Reset.” It’s… well, essentially only boiled chicken and steamed asparagus for fourteen days, followed by the gradual reintroduction of… one single green vegetable per day. The advertisement claimed remarkable results, quite frankly. Lost weight, increased energy… all rather sensational claims. I thought I’d give it a try, but after five days of chicken and asparagus, I'm starting to feel… less vital, and more just… tired. And surprisingly hungry.
DOCTOR: I see. The “Vitality Reset,” interesting. Online diets can be… ambitious, to put it mildly. Five days of just chicken and asparagus is quite restrictive, and it’s not surprising you’re feeling tired and hungry. That’s not a balanced intake at all. It sounds like your body is definitely telling you something. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your energy levels before you started the diet?
PATIENT: Well, before, I was… fairly active for my age, I believe. I still do a bit of work on miniatures—I used to work on special effects, you see—and that requires a fair degree of concentration and dexterity. I’d potter about in the garden, and take a walk most days, though not a brisk one, mind you. I wouldn’t say I was brimming with youthful energy, but certainly not… listless. I suppose a normal level for an older gentleman. I hadn't been feeling particularly unwell before starting, just… thought a bit of a ‘reset’ might be beneficial. I do enjoy a good glass of sherry in the evenings, you understand, and thought I might curb that a little.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Vantine. So, a fairly active lifestyle with some normal age-related energy fluctuations. And you started this diet hoping to improve things a bit, perhaps scale back on the sherry… perfectly understandable. It sounds like you were generally well before you started, which is good. Now, besides the tiredness and hunger, have you noticed any other changes since you began the diet?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My… digestion hasn’t been entirely regular, if you follow me. A bit… sluggish. And I’ve been feeling rather cold, even indoors. My wife – my ex-wife, rather – always said I had poor circulation, and this certainly hasn’t helped, I suspect. Not to mention a general feeling of… irritability. I find myself snapping at the television, which is most unlike me. Small things, really, but noticeable. Oh, and my sleep has been… fitful. Waking up several times a night.
DOCTOR: Okay, sluggish digestion, feeling cold, irritability, and fitful sleep… those are all potentially connected to a significant dietary change like this one, and a lack of sufficient nutrients. It sounds like your body is definitely reacting. To get a more complete picture, let's quickly go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate removed – oh, must be twenty years ago now – and I take medication for slightly elevated blood pressure, a small dose, mind you. The doctor – Dr. Abernathy, lovely man, retired now – said it was nothing to worry about, just keeping an eye on it. Other than that… a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is hardly surprising at my age. And I used to suffer from rather terrible migraines, but those haven’t troubled me for years. That's about it, I believe. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Right, prostatectomy twenty years ago, controlled blood pressure, and a history of migraines that have thankfully resolved. Good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not to my knowledge. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had a particularly violent reaction to anything, thankfully. My ex-wife did have a rather severe allergy to cats, which was… inconvenient, let’s say. But that was her problem, not mine.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications besides the one for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for blood pressure, Doctor. A small, white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast… or used to take it with my breakfast, before my current… culinary experiment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and just a brief look at your overall condition. Do you mind if I take your temperature as well?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I'm quite used to these things, I assure you. Years of check-ups, you see. Though, admittedly, they’ve become rather less frequent in recent times.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70, but not concerning given your history and recent dietary changes. Pulse is steady at 72. Lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a bit of tenderness. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Reflexes are normal, and your gait is stable. Overall, everything seems within acceptable limits, but your body is definitely telling you this diet isn't agreeing with it. It's likely a combination of insufficient calories and nutrient deficiencies causing the fatigue, irritability, and sluggish digestion. The feeling cold could also be related to a lowered metabolic rate.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, in a way, to hear you say it’s not anything serious. Though I must confess, I suspected as much. I've always believed in listening to one's body, and my body is currently telling me to eat something other than boiled chicken.
DOCTOR: Exactly! And that’s very good intuition, Mr. Vantine. Your body is trying to tell you something, and we should listen. Here's what I recommend. We absolutely need to stop this diet immediately. It's far too restrictive and isn't sustainable, especially given your age and medical history. We'll focus on gradually reintroducing a balanced diet. Start with small, easily digestible meals, focusing on protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Things like fish, chicken, vegetables, and whole grains. I also recommend a multivitamin to help replenish any lost nutrients. I'd like to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and vitamin D levels. This will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and guide us in creating a tailored nutrition plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… eminently sensible, Doctor. Stop the diet immediately – I can certainly agree with that. And the blood work sounds… thorough. I confess, I've always been rather averse to needles, but I understand it's necessary. A gradual reintroduction of normal food – yes, that appeals to me greatly. And a tailored plan… well, that’s far better than relying on online advertisements, certainly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll get that blood work ordered right away. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it should be relatively quick. We’ll need a fasting blood sample, so you'll need to refrain from eating or drinking anything except water for 8-12 hours beforehand. I’ll also give you a referral to a registered dietitian. They can work with you to create a personalized meal plan that takes into account your preferences and nutritional needs. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A registered dietitian, you say? That sounds… excellent. Someone who understands the intricacies of food, rather than just recommending boiled chicken. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve been most thorough, and I feel considerably relieved. Though I suspect my ex-wife will be rather pleased to hear I've finally abandoned this… folly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m glad I could help, Mr. Vantine. And a good dietitian will be invaluable in getting you back on track. I’ll print out the lab requisition and the referral information for the dietitian. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the blood work results and review your progress. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as severe fatigue, dizziness, or chest pain. Here are the instructions for the fasting blood work and the dietitian’s contact information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s quite all. You’ve been exceedingly helpful, and I appreciate your thoroughness and… common sense. I daresay I should have consulted you before embarking on this foolish venture, but one does occasionally succumb to temptation, you see. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It's never too late to seek medical advice, and I’m glad you came in. Remember, listening to your body is the most important thing. Have a lovely day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I'll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
