DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, to put it plainly, I’d like to… stop smoking, if that’s possible. I’ve been at it for… a very long time, you see. Perhaps too long.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knoch. It’s excellent that you're taking this step. It is possible, and we can absolutely work together to create a plan. How many years have you been smoking, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I started when I was seventeen, back in Lithuania. That would make… sixty-odd years. Sixty-two, to be precise. It was quite common then, you understand. Everyone smoked. It was a… a different time. Now, it’s just… a habit, a bad one, of course. But a long-standing one.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two years is a long time, you are right. And it’s completely understandable that it’s become deeply ingrained as a habit. Have you tried to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, several times. Mostly after my sister, God rest her soul, got sick. Lung trouble, you see. I’d manage a week, maybe two, then… the cravings would get to me. I’d tell myself, “Just one,” and then… well, you know how it goes. Patches, gum… I’ve tried a few things. Nothing really stuck. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, and you shouldn’t feel discouraged. Those cravings are incredibly powerful, and it sounds like you’ve already shown a lot of willpower trying different methods. Approximately how many cigarettes do you smoke a day, currently?
PATIENT: About a pack and a half, Doctor. Maybe a bit more if I’m… agitated. I used to smoke more, when I was working at the factory. It was a stressful job, you see. Now that I’m retired… it's more for comfort, I suppose. Old habits, dying hard. It’s… a rather unpleasant thought, admitting that, but it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open, Mr. Knoch. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. We can definitely explore different options. Before we discuss those, could you tell me if you have any other medical conditions, like heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from getting old. My doctor, the one back at Saint Luke’s, always said I had a strong heart. He passed away a few years ago, good man. No, nothing major. Just the knees. And the… the smoking, of course. That’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And I'm glad to hear you've been generally healthy. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers for your knees?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, Doctor, when the knees are acting up. Nothing regular. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. Sometimes not even that. I try to manage with stretching and… gentle exercise. It helps a little. I’m not one for taking pills if I can avoid it, you see. Always worried about the side effects.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about side effects, Mr. Knoch. That’s very sensible. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I've eaten… all sorts of things in my life, travelled a bit, you see. Never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though that didn’t stop me from getting addicted to these… these cigarettes. A bit of irony, wouldn’t you say? A strong stomach, but a weak will when it comes to smoking.
DOCTOR: It's not about a weak will, Mr. Knoch. Nicotine is a very addictive substance. Before we discuss potential quitting methods, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had lung cancer, heart disease, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, my father… he smoked as well, you see. All his life. He died of… something in his chest, when I was quite young. I don’t recall the details exactly. The doctors didn’t explain things much back then. It wasn’t lung cancer, I don’t think. More… a cough that wouldn’t go away. My mother… she lived to be ninety, very strong woman. Never smoked a day in her life. And my sister… she had emphysema, that’s why I tried to quit before. A sad story, really. She warned me about this… this dependence. But it’s too late now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s never too late, Mr. Knoch. While your sister’s experience is concerning, and your father’s illness is something we should keep in mind, it doesn’t mean quitting is impossible. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your current living situation and if anyone else smokes in your home?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor, in a small apartment downtown. It's… cozy, I suppose. And no, nobody smokes in my apartment. I wouldn't allow it. I used to date a woman, a lovely lady, but she… disliked the smell. Quite understandable, really. I smoke on the balcony, always. I try to be considerate. It's… a solitary habit, mostly. Just me and the cigarettes, looking out at the city. A bit sad when you say it like that, isn’t it? But that’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That gives me a very complete understanding of your situation. Now, let’s talk about options for quitting. We could discuss nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges – or prescription medications like bupropion or varenicline, which can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. There are also behavioral therapies, like counseling or support groups, that can provide strategies for coping with triggers and staying motivated. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve tried the patches before, as I mentioned. Didn’t seem to do much good. The gum… I didn’t much care for the taste. To be honest, the thought of taking more pills… it doesn't appeal to me. I’ve never been one for medication. Perhaps… the counseling? Talking to someone… that might be helpful. I’ve kept a lot bottled up for a long time, I suspect. But… would that really make a difference? It seems… a rather large undertaking, stopping after all these years.
DOCTOR: It is a large undertaking, Mr. Knoch, and it’s perfectly normal to feel hesitant. Counseling can be very effective, providing you with tools and support to navigate the emotional and behavioral aspects of quitting. We have a wonderful counselor here at the clinic, Ms. Evelyn Reed, who specializes in addiction. Many patients have found her sessions incredibly helpful. We can also explore alternative therapies, like mindfulness or acupuncture, if you’re interested. Before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure – to ensure there are no immediate health concerns that need to be addressed before starting a quitting program. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A check-up couldn’t hurt, I suppose. And Ms. Reed… a counselor, you say? Yes, perhaps that would be the best place to start. I’ve never spoken to anyone about this before, always kept it to myself. A bit foolish, really. But… I suppose it’s time. Yes, let’s do the check-up, and then perhaps… we can arrange a session with Ms. Reed. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to ask for help, and I commend you for taking this step. Please have a seat on the examination table, and I'll get started. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear, but there is some diminished airflow, which is not unexpected given your smoking history. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. We’ll want to monitor that as we proceed. Everything appears stable enough to proceed with a quitting program, but it’s important to keep these findings in mind. I’ll make a note to schedule you for a follow-up appointment in a month to check your blood pressure and assess your progress. Now, let me see about getting you scheduled with Ms. Reed…
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A month, you say? I suppose that’s fair. I’m… a bit nervous, to be honest, about the counseling. But I trust your judgement. Diminished airflow… yes, that doesn't surprise me. I’ve felt it, a bit of a tightness in my chest sometimes. But I’ve always just… ignored it. A foolish habit, I suppose, that as well. Yes, please, schedule me with Ms. Reed whenever she’s available. I’m… ready to try. Finally. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I feel a bit lighter, just having this plan. A bit of hope, perhaps.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Knoch. I’m glad you feel a bit of hope. Ms. Reed has some availability next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at two… yes, that would be perfect. Thank you. I… I believe that will do for now. I suppose I should… be going. It was very kind of you, Doctor, to spend so much time with me. I’ve… felt a weight lifted, truly. Thank you once again, Doctor Panjoj. And… thank you for not judging me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It was my pleasure. Remember, quitting smoking is a journey, and there will be ups and downs. But I’m confident that with Ms. Reed’s support, and your determination, you can achieve your goal. Here's a summary of our plan: You have an appointment with Ms. Reed next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you with me in one month to monitor your blood pressure and progress. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with some informational pamphlets on smoking cessation and contact information for support groups. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, you’re not alone in this. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Knoch.
