DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I gotta be quick. Got a thing later. It's about this exam. For the… the army. They want me to get checked out first. Seems silly, but, you know. Gotta do what they say.
DOCTOR: Right, the army physical. Understandable. It's good you're getting it done. Okay, so this is just a general check-up to ensure you meet their requirements. To start, can you tell me a little more about what specifically they want checked?
PATIENT: Honestly? No clue. They just handed me a list of stuff. Height, weight… usual things, I guess. Vision, hearing… all that. Didn't really say why they needed each thing, just… do it. Seems like a waste of time if you ask me, but… they're paying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a standard physical. We can certainly do that. It's good they're covering all the bases. Let's start with some basics. You mentioned height and weight – I see we have 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms on file. Is that current information?
PATIENT: Yep. Still that. Haven't… shrunk or gotten fatter, thankfully. People always ask about that, like it's some big shocker. I'm a skinny guy, alright? Always have been. Doesn't mean I'm weak.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not. Body size doesn't equate to strength, and I understand your frustration. It's good to know those numbers are accurate. Okay, let's move on to vision and hearing. Have you noticed any changes in either recently?
PATIENT: Nope. See fine, hear fine. Always have. Maybe a little trouble with high-pitched noises sometimes, but who doesn't? Wife yells loud enough, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any pain in either ear?
PATIENT: No dizziness. Ringing… not really. Sometimes after a loud noise, maybe, but it goes away quick. Pain? Nah. Never had ear pain. Look, is this gonna take long? I really need to——keep to my schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, let's quickly go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Healthy as a horse, always have been. Never even broken a bone. Always been careful, I guess. Wife worries too much, if I’m honest. Says I should get a check-up every year, but… what for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No previous diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Never needed 'em. Always been lucky, I tell ya. Some folks are always in and out of the hospital. Not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries either. Now, quickly, any major illnesses in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… that’s a long story. Dad… he had something with his heart, I think. But he smoked, drank, the whole thing. Not a good example. Mom was… well, she just got old. Everything stopped working, you know? Nothing specific. It’s not like I’m gonna get what they got.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart issues with your father and general decline with your mother. Do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single pill. Don't believe in 'em, if I'm honest. Just a waste of money. Wife tries to get me to take something for my… well, never mind. It’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, are you allergic to anything – medications, food, insect stings, anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Bees sting me sometimes when I'm working in the garden, but nothing happens. A little swelling, maybe, but it goes away quick. Tough skin, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness, that’s helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to finish up. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, vision and hearing, and a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Will that work?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t take too long, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your heart and lungs. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright, whatever. Just get on with it. Deep breaths… right. Is this gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt at all. Just listening. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good breath sounds, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let's check your vision. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed 'em. See just fine, always have. Though things are a bit blurry up close sometimes. But that's just… getting older, I suppose. Doesn't bother me much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just quickly check your distance vision, then. Could you stand about ten feet away and read the smallest line you can make out on the chart?
PATIENT: Ten feet… right. Ugh, these letters are tiny. Okay… E… F… P… T… Uh… is that a V? No… L… I think. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see you're having some difficulty with the smaller letters. Your distance vision is approximately 20/30 in each eye. Now, let's check your hearing. I'm going to put these headphones on you, and you'll tell me when you hear a tone in each ear.
PATIENT: Ugh, more stuff. Fine. Just get it over with. My hearing's fine, alright? I can hear perfectly well. But go ahead, waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness, I'm going to play some tones at different frequencies. Just tell me when you hear something, even if it's very faint. Starting with your right ear… Okay… and now the left ear… Alright, hearing is within normal limits, though slightly diminished at higher frequencies in both ears. Now, I'll just quickly take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. This will just confirm everything looks normal.
PATIENT: Just hurry up. I hate things in my ears.
DOCTOR: Ears appear clear, no signs of infection or cerumen impaction. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Alright, Mr. Hartness, everything appears to be normal. Overall, you’re in good health. Now, regarding your army physical, based on this quick exam, you meet most of the basic requirements. However, your slightly diminished distance vision and high-frequency hearing may require further evaluation by an optometrist or audiologist to ensure you meet their specific standards. I'm going to write a referral for those tests, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Referrals, huh? More appointments. Fantastic. So I'm not totally useless, then? Good. Look, can I just get a note saying I passed something? Just so I can show the army folks? They'll probably want something official.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can certainly provide a summary of our findings for your records. Here you go. This summarizes that you have completed a physical examination on August 2nd, 2025, with generally normal findings, noting slightly diminished distance vision and high-frequency hearing that I've recommended be evaluated further. It also states that you are currently medically cleared for the vision and hearing evaluations. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Nah. I think that's it. Just… hopefully those other tests don't take too long. Thanks, I guess.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Hartness. I've included the contact information for a reputable optometrist and audiologist in the area. Please don't hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or need assistance scheduling those appointments. Have a good day.
