DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well… it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to be cleared for it, I understand? It's… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and things feel… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's completely normal to feel a little overwhelmed when talking about medical things, especially surgery. Don’t worry about explaining it perfectly – we’ll get there together. And it's good you mentioned your memory – we can take things at your pace. To start, can you tell me what kind of surgery you’re hoping to have?
PATIENT: It’s… cosmetic, I believe? My late husband… he wanted me to have it done. Something about… improving my appearance. It’s been a while since we discussed the specifics, and frankly, I don’t recall the name of the procedure. It involves… my stomach, I think? Perhaps some lifting? Oh dear, I apologize. It’s all so vague. I just know he arranged consultations, and I’m meant to be getting this done.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Mackenzi. It sounds like this is a sensitive topic, and it's been a while. We'll figure it out. So, it's a cosmetic procedure involving your stomach… lifting is a good clue. Let's see if we can narrow it down. Do you recall where you had these consultations?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult one. I believe it was a clinic… not too far from here, actually. A rather modern building, I recall. Lots of glass. And… there was a fountain in the lobby. A small one, with cherubs, I think. But the name… it escapes me. I've been to so many appointments lately, it all blurs together. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not unhelpful at all, Mackenzi. Details like the fountain are actually very helpful! It sounds like it might have been "Aesthetic Serenity," just off of Elm Street. They specialize in body contouring and lifts. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Aesthetic Serenity… yes! That is it! That’s the place. Oh, thank goodness. You’ve saved me a great deal of stress. Yes, I had several appointments there with… a different doctor. Before… everything. That’s where the arrangements were made. They said I needed clearance before proceeding. It's a relief to finally remember something concrete.
DOCTOR: Excellent! That’s great we’ve pinpointed that. So, they’ve already done some initial assessment and believe you're a candidate, and now they need my clearance. To help me understand the situation better and ensure your safety, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Of course. Well… I’ve always been relatively healthy, I believe. I enjoy gardening, so I’m quite active. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. I do… have a bit of trouble with my cholesterol, I think? My previous doctor mentioned it, but I don’t recall the specifics. And… my blood pressure can be a little high sometimes, especially when I’m stressed. But other than that… I believe that’s all. I take a small medication for my nerves, just as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Gardening is wonderful – good for the body and the mind! And good that you don't smoke and rarely drink. You mentioned cholesterol and blood pressure, and a medication for your nerves. Let’s start with the cholesterol. Do you know what your numbers were, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I’m afraid not. I have the paperwork at home, I believe, but… it’s been a while since I’ve looked at it. I know it was… slightly elevated, but I don’t recall the exact figures. My previous doctor wanted me to… watch my diet, and perhaps take something for it, but I haven't been very diligent, I confess. I’ve been rather preoccupied lately. I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright. These things happen, especially when life gets busy. And what about the medication for your nerves?
PATIENT: It’s… a small blue pill. I only take it when I feel particularly anxious. It helps me calm down. The name… escapes me again. I believe it was prescribed after my husband… passed. It’s not something I take regularly, thankfully. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. I truly wish I could be more helpful with the details. It’s frustrating to feel so… foggy.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mackenzi. It sounds like it's a medication for situational anxiety, and that’s helpful to know. It’s common to have memory lapses, especially during times of stress or grief. Let's see if we can access your records from Aesthetic Serenity to get a clearer picture of your medications and previous cholesterol levels. Just one moment…
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience very much. It’s a relief to know you’re taking such good care of me. I do hope we can get to the bottom of this. I simply want to be sure everything is safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve pulled up your records from Aesthetic Serenity. It looks like you’ve had a consultation with Dr. Ramirez regarding a tummy tuck – abdominoplasty – and liposuction. Your previous cholesterol reading was 220, which is slightly elevated. Your blood pressure was averaging around 135/85, also a little on the higher side. And you are currently prescribed Lorazepam 0.5mg as needed for anxiety. It also notes that you have a BMI of 30.5, which puts you in the obese category. Have you been told about your BMI before?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I don’t recall being told about my BMI specifically. Thirty-point-five… That does sound… concerning. I’ve always been… a bit larger, I suppose. My husband… he never minded. He said I was… robust. I haven't weighed myself recently. It’s difficult to… focus on such things. Is that… a problem for the surgery?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a problem, Mackenzi, but it does increase the risks associated with any surgery, particularly with abdominoplasty and liposuction. Things like wound healing, infection, and blood clots are more common in individuals with a higher BMI. It's good you're aware of it now. Before we proceed, I'd like to discuss some strategies to mitigate these risks. Would you be open to a consultation with a nutritionist to help you optimize your diet and potentially lower your BMI before surgery?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will make the surgery safer, then I am certainly willing. I haven’t focused much on my health lately, and perhaps it’s time I did. A nutritionist… that would be very helpful. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll go ahead and write a referral for you to a registered dietitian, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. She’s excellent and specializes in pre- and post-operative nutrition. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course. And… I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. Nothing major. Oh! And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered fully. As for illnesses… I’ve always been quite lucky, I believe. No serious conditions, thankfully. My late husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was quite a few years ago. Does that information help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No significant medical history on your end is good to know. And it’s good to be aware of your husband’s heart trouble, as there can be a genetic component to some conditions. What about family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think. And my father… he passed away from a stroke, quite suddenly. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure, like me. As for my husband’s family… I didn’t know them very well. He didn’t speak about them often. Does that provide enough information, Doctor? I feel rather helpless remembering all these details.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mackenzi. Knowing about the diabetes, stroke, and high blood pressure in your family is important. It helps us understand your risk factors and monitor your health accordingly. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I find it… quite repulsive, actually. My late husband tried it once, many years ago, but he quickly stopped. He said it was… unpleasant. I’ve always been very careful about my health, in that regard. I believe a healthy lifestyle is very important.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only… occasionally. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. I don’t drink regularly, and certainly not to excess. It’s… a small indulgence. I rarely drink alone. I prefer a cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements, besides the Lorazepam?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I do take a multivitamin, every morning. Just a standard one, to keep my energy up. And… I occasionally take fish oil capsules, for my joints. They help with the arthritis in my hands, a little. Other than that… no, I believe that’s all. I try to stay natural, if possible. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mackenzi. So, you take a multivitamin, fish oil, and Lorazepam as needed. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any abnormal lung sounds. Good. Next, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated, as we discussed. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. It's a little soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. And finally, I'll check your reflexes and neurological function. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We'll need to monitor that closely. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds… reasonable. I'm not surprised about my blood pressure, given what we've discussed. It does tend to rise when I'm anxious, and I confess, I’ve been quite stressed lately. I suppose it's a relief that everything else appears normal. Does this mean… I’m a suitable candidate for the surgery? Or do I need to address my blood pressure first? I'm a little confused, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid question, Mackenzi. It's not a simple yes or no. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and BMI, proceeding directly with surgery would carry a higher risk. Ideally, we’d like to get your blood pressure under better control and optimize your weight before surgery. This could involve lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – or potentially medication, if needed. I also recommend a cardiology consult to get their opinion on your overall cardiac risk. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… makes sense. It's a little disappointing, of course, but I understand the need for caution. So, I need to see a heart doctor, and… work on my diet and exercise. And perhaps lose some weight. It feels… overwhelming, to be honest. But if it will make the surgery safer, then I am willing to do whatever is necessary. What would you recommend as a first step? Should I schedule the cardiology appointment first? And what about the nutritionist?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, it does feel overwhelming, and it’s perfectly okay to feel that way. You’ve already taken the biggest step by being willing to address these concerns. I recommend scheduling the cardiology appointment first. They’ll perform some tests to assess your cardiac health and provide a more tailored plan. I’ll write a referral for Dr. Chen – she’s excellent. Then, we can schedule an appointment with Ms. Rodriguez, the nutritionist, to help you create a healthy eating plan. And finally, let’s start with small, achievable exercise goals. Even a 30-minute walk a few times a week can make a difference. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That does sound… manageable. Cardiology first, then the nutritionist. And small exercise goals. I can do that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel much more… hopeful now. What about the Lorazepam? Should I continue taking that as needed? I don't want it to interfere with the surgery, or the anesthesia.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad you feel more hopeful. It’s important to address your concerns and proceed with caution. Regarding the Lorazepam, it’s best to be transparent with the anesthesiologist about it. They’ll need to know what medications you’re taking to ensure your safety during surgery. It could interact with the anesthesia, so it's important to discuss it with them during your pre-operative evaluation. I’ll make a note in your chart. I'll also give you a list of pre-operative instructions and a referral to Dr. Chen and Ms. Rodriguez. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience and kindness. I feel much better prepared now, and I’m grateful for your guidance. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. Remember, take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I'll see you back here after your appointments with Dr. Chen and Ms. Rodriguez. Have a good day, and take care of yourself!
