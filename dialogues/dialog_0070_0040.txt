DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, my side, my flank, it’s been giving me trouble again. And I seem to be getting those water infections... UTIs, the nurse called them... more often than I'd like. It's been going on for a while now, and I thought it best to get it checked properly. It’s something to do with my kidneys, I believe.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. You suspect it may be related to your kidneys, and you're right to be proactive in getting this checked. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a bit more about this flank pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s usually on my right side, a bit higher up, you understand? It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Sometimes it’s just a discomfort, other times it’s quite bothersome. It comes and goes, I suppose. It doesn't come after anything specific, not that I've noticed. And it can last for a few hours, or a few days. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on the right flank, intermittent in nature, lasting hours to days. And you haven’t noticed anything that specifically triggers it?
PATIENT: No, nothing I can put my finger on, Doctor. I drink plenty of water, I think. I haven’t changed my diet, not recently. And I’m not doing anything particularly strenuous these days. It just… comes on. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. I always worry it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes and seeking medical attention. Let’s talk about these UTIs you mentioned. How often would you say you’re getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, it's become rather frequent, Doctor. Perhaps three or four times in the last six months? I used to get them very rarely, years ago. Now they seem to be coming every few weeks. The nurse always tells me to drink lots of water, and I do, but it doesn’t seem to stop them. It's usually burning when I go to the toilet, and sometimes a bit of discomfort afterwards.
DOCTOR: Three or four times in the last six months, with burning during urination and post-void discomfort. That is a significant increase in frequency. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… now that you mention it, yes. Just a little, once or twice. It wasn't a lot, just a tinge of pink, you understand? It frightened me a bit, so I tried not to dwell on it. It didn’t happen every time I had an infection, just a couple of times. I thought it might be something I ate, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Mr. Espinueva. It's important information. And it’s good you brought it up. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with these infections or flank pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t felt properly sick, you understand? No shivering, no being sick. Sometimes a little tired, perhaps, but that could be just getting older. And I might feel a bit weak when the pain is bad, but no proper fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Just the flank pain, recurrent UTIs, intermittent hematuria, and some fatigue. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Many years ago, the doctor told me I have something to do with my kidneys… polycystic kidney disease, that's what she called it. I've had it for a long time, and it hasn’t bothered me too much until recently. I haven’t seen a specialist about it for years, to be honest. Just my regular doctor, who passed away a few years ago.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease. That's important information, Mr. Espinueva. And you haven't been following up with a specialist for it?
PATIENT: No, not for a long, long time, Doctor. Like I said, my regular doctor handled it for years, and when he passed away… well, I just never got around to finding another one. It wasn't causing me any problems, so I didn’t think it was urgent. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to put things off when you're feeling well. But given your history of polycystic kidney disease, and these new symptoms – the flank pain and recurrent UTIs – it's definitely time to re-evaluate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if you don’t mind. And I’ll also want to order some lab tests, including a urine analysis and blood work. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical examination and some tests… yes, that’s fine. I trust your judgement. I’d just like to get to the bottom of it, and hopefully get some relief.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the physical examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently palpate your abdomen, paying particular attention to your flanks and kidneys. Please let me know if anything is painful. Now, I'm going to gently press here, on your right flank... Any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s a little tender, Doctor. Not terribly painful, but I can feel it. A sort of dull ache, like the one I’ve been describing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about here… any discomfort when I press on this spot?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit more there, Doctor. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s definitely… uncomfortable. It feels a bit like a pressure, really. It makes me want to take a deep breath.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm also noticing a slight fullness in your right flank, though it's difficult to assess definitively. Based on the examination, and your history, it does seem likely that your recurrent UTIs and flank pain are related to your polycystic kidney disease. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a more accurate diagnosis, we definitely need those lab tests. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urine analysis with microscopy and culture. I'm also going to order a kidney ultrasound to visualize your kidneys and assess the size and condition of the cysts. Would you prefer to do those tests here at the clinic, or would you prefer to go elsewhere?
PATIENT: Here at the clinic would be much easier, Doctor. I don't like travelling too far these days. As long as it's convenient, that would be best. I’ll do whatever you think is best, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can certainly do them here. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It’s best to try and provide a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. Once we have those results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, as you've been doing, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had any problems with medications before. Just the usual… a little bit of drowsiness sometimes, but nothing serious. I do take a small tablet for my blood pressure, but that’s all. Lisinopril, I think it's called.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure. That’s good to know. So, to recap, we've discussed your flank pain, recurrent UTIs, history of polycystic kidney disease, and your current medication. We’re going to get some lab tests done – blood work and a urine analysis – and an ultrasound of your kidneys. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I'm just relieved to finally be getting to the bottom of it. I’m very grateful for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. We'll take it one step at a time. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and come up with the best plan for managing your condition. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, please just relax. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor.
