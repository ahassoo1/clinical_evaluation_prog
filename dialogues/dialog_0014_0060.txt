DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Osterholm. It’s…family history, really. My mother’s side. A lot of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s always something with them. I just want to make sure I’m not heading that way, you know? Preventative measures, that sort of thing. I’m still young, but…better safe than sorry, I always say.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Family history is… important. Though, frankly, people worry too much about these things. Still, we can certainly look into it. “Heart stuff” is rather vague, though. Was anyone actually diagnosed with anything specific?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… yes, a few. My grandmother had… something with the valves, I think. And my aunt, on that side, she had… well, she had a stroke. A pretty bad one. And then my uncle… he had lung cancer. Smoker, though, so… that's different, I guess. But still, it feels like it runs in the family, you know? Even my cousin has high blood pressure, and she's barely forty. It just… worries me. A lot.
DOCTOR: Right, right. A valve problem… stroke… lung cancer… High blood pressure is…common these days. Look, genetics are only part of the picture, you know?
PATIENT: Exactly! It's not like I'm just going to automatically get sick because my family is prone to it, right? It’s the lifestyle choices too, isn’t it? I eat pretty well, mostly. And I try to exercise, though…work gets in the way. Still, I’m not completely reckless, if that makes sense. I just want some reassurance, a check-up, maybe some tests to see where I stand. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Reassurance… people always want reassurance. We can certainly do a basic physical exam and some blood work. Standard cholesterol, blood sugar, that sort of thing. Don’t get your hopes up about getting a detailed genetic predisposition analysis, though. Those tests are… often inconclusive, and frankly, most people can’t handle the information they get back. Now, let's start with your personal medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had chickenpox as a kid, obviously. And I broke my arm when I was… ten, maybe? Nothing that would be relevant now, I don’t think. I’ve always been… pretty healthy, to be honest. Which is why I’m a little paranoid about this whole family thing. It feels like it's just… waiting to happen. Do you think… stress could play a part? I mean, worrying constantly can't be good for you, right?
DOCTOR: Stress… everyone blames stress these days. It's a convenient explanation. Still, it’s not nothing. Alright, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven't really had to take much medication in my life. A few antibiotics here and there, for colds, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. Oh, wait! I had a reaction to a mosquito bite once, a really bad one. Swelled up pretty badly. Does that count? It was years ago though. Probably irrelevant.
DOCTOR: A mosquito bite… marginally relevant. Now, what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I figure if my body needs something, it'll tell me. I’m a firm believer in letting the body do its own thing, you know? Less interference, the better. So, where are we with these tests? Are we going to get anything done today, or…?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Let's do a basic exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a quick look at your throat. And we'll order some blood work. Standard panel. Don’t expect miracles, though. It’s just a baseline. If you’ll just have a seat… and try to relax. Even though, frankly, I doubt it will make a difference.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Honestly, I just hope this doesn't take too long. I have a lot on my plate. Just… try to be quick, alright? I’m not exactly a fan of doctors, if you haven’t already gathered that.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's get this over with. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is… regular. A little fast, perhaps, but not alarming. Blood pressure is… 128/82. Not bad. Take another deep breath. And… exhale. Lungs sound clear. A little wheezing, possibly, but that could be nothing. Pupils are… reactive. Throat looks… unremarkable. Generally, you seem… perfectly fine. Which, frankly, is what I expected. We'll get the blood work ordered, and you can follow up with me next week to discuss the results. Don’t hold your breath, though. They rarely tell us anything useful. Any questions?
PATIENT: "Perfectly fine"? That’s it? After all my worrying? That seems…dismissive, frankly. Well, what about the wheezing? You said "possibly." What does that even mean? And what about my family history? Does anything concern you? I came here for a reason, you know. I didn’t just come here to be told I’m “perfectly fine.” Is there anything I should be worried about? Be honest, please.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Theriot, I understand your anxiety. But honestly, you are a young, relatively healthy male. A little wheezing could be anything – a mild allergy, a bit of irritation. It's not indicative of a serious problem. And your family history… well, family history is just that – history. It doesn't dictate your future. We’re ordering the blood work as a precaution, to get a baseline, but I highly doubt it will reveal anything alarming. Frankly, you're wasting my time, and your own money, worrying about things that are unlikely to happen. I'm telling you, you’re perfectly fine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And please, try to relax. Worrying won’t help. .
PATIENT: "Wasting her time." Honestly. Perfectly fine… as if that’s a diagnosis. I knew it. Doctors… they never take anything seriously. Fine. Blood work, then. But I’m getting a second opinion, no matter what the results say. .
