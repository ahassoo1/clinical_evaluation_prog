DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, uh, it's for life insurance. They sent me here for a check-up, something about medical underwriting. I just want to get it over with, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Life insurance, right. Standard procedure, I suppose. Lots of companies are fussy these days. Just a routine check-up then. Don’t expect a thorough examination; they only need the basics. We’ll do some vitals, listen to your heart and lungs, quick blood work… you know the drill. Before we start, are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? And my knees ache a bit when it rains… old age, I guess. Nothing serious, though. Nothing that keeps me from working.
DOCTOR: “Tired” and “aching knees”... remarkably unhelpful descriptions. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Just… tired. Like, I could sleep for a week and still be tired. And the knees… they just feel stiff, especially in the mornings. Like they need to be… oiled, maybe? I don't know, I'm not a doctor. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: "Oiled," right. Look, Mr. Putney, vague complaints get vague results. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not usually. Maybe when I'm walking up a really steep hill, but I live on a pretty flat island, so… not often. I work at the hotel, mostly behind the desk. Lots of sitting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Never had chest pain. Everything feels… normal, I guess. Besides the tiredness and the knees. Seriously, is this going to take much longer? I got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just get through the basics. Do you have any history of diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, but I don't remember what exactly. We didn’t talk about medical stuff much back home. He was a fisherman, you know? Hard life. I don’t think anyone had diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't really take much medicine, honestly. A painkiller now and then for a headache, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just the basics—heart, lungs, blood pressure, weight… don’t worry, it won’t be anything extensive. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated. And I hear a murmur, but it’s faint. We’ll need to repeat it a couple of times. Now, breathe deeply for me...
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My mother's blood pressure was always high too. Just hurry, please. I really need to get back to work. Is this murmur… serious?
DOCTOR: It can be. Elevated blood pressure, especially with a family history, needs to be monitored. As for the murmur… it's not immediately alarming, but it’s something we should investigate further. It could be nothing, but it could also indicate a valve problem. I’m going to order a basic blood panel – complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, cholesterol – and an EKG. And I'd like you to see a cardiologist just to be safe. It’s best to rule things out, alright?
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Wait a minute… you’re saying something’s wrong with my heart? I feel fine! I just need this insurance exam… this is getting way too complicated. Can’t you just… sign off on it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, the insurance company wants a medical assessment. That's what we’re doing. And I am obligated to provide an accurate one. I can’t simply "sign off" on it if there are potential concerns. The elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur warrant further investigation. Look, I understand you’re concerned about work, but your health is more important. A cardiologist will perform an echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a clear picture of what's going on. I'll write the referrals. And I recommend scheduling these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram… Fine. Okay. But can you at least… tell me if this is something really serious? Is my heart going to… stop? And will this insurance thing be delayed because of all this? I really need that insurance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I cannot tell you definitively whether or not your heart will “stop.” That would be irresponsible. The purpose of the echocardiogram is to rule out any serious problems. It’s a precautionary measure, alright?
PATIENT: Okay… So, what do I do now? Just… make appointments? And how long will it take? I got shifts… and I really need that insurance. This is a mess.
DOCTOR: Yes, just schedule appointments with one of these cardiologists as soon as you can. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we'll know what's going on. As for the insurance, it’s likely it will be delayed until they receive the results of the evaluation. I’ll make a note on the paperwork explaining the situation, and you can contact the insurance company directly to inquire about the process. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication, to start controlling it while we await the specialist’s assessment. We can adjust the dosage as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies… This is just… great. More appointments, more waiting… Okay, fine. I’ll schedule the appointments. But I’m telling you, I feel fine. This is all just a waste of time. Is there anything else? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Just take the medication as prescribed, and schedule those appointments promptly. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. I have a waiting room full of patients, Mr. Putney. You are free to go now. Here's a printout of the medication instructions as well.
