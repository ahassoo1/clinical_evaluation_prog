DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Shely. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I'm here today regarding… well, it’s about the masks at work. My job, Protective Services… we’ve started requiring them again, and I’m having a difficult time with it. I'm hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps find a suitable alternative.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I understand. It’s important to address any concerns that are impacting your ability to perform your duties safely and comfortably. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe what difficulties you're experiencing with wearing the masks?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… a bit hard to explain. It isn’t that I can’t wear one, exactly. It’s more a feeling… a tightness in my chest, a bit of trouble breathing, and a general sense of… unease. It’s been happening since they started requiring them again, and it makes focusing on the job… difficult. I’ve never had these feelings before the masks, and I'm a large man, Doctor, so it's… concerning to feel this way. It’s like the air isn’t quite enough, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Knabenshue. And it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. It’s important to investigate these symptoms, especially since they began with the mask requirement. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through some details. First, can you tell me a bit more about when these symptoms occur?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. They start almost immediately. Within five minutes of putting the mask on, I begin to feel the tightness. It builds gradually, and within fifteen to twenty minutes, it’s enough to be distracting. It doesn’t go away until I remove the mask, then it slowly eases. I’ve tried different types of masks – the paper ones, the cloth ones, even those N95s – and they all seem to cause the same problem. It’s… consistent, unfortunately. It doesn't seem to matter which mask it is.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Knabenshue. That's very helpful. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the chest tightness and breathing difficulties?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is something else. It’s… a bit difficult to describe. I get a sort of… lightheadedness, a little bit of dizziness, especially if I’m moving around a lot. It's not severe, but noticeable. And… well, I’ve also been more irritable lately, quicker to frustration. I don’t typically lose my temper, but I’ve found myself a bit on edge since this started. It’s all… connected, I believe. It all seems to happen when I'm wearing the mask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Lightheadedness, dizziness, and increased irritability in conjunction with the chest tightness and breathing difficulties… that gives us more to work with. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anxiety?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve always been a healthy man, as far as I know. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like asthma or COPD. My heart has always been strong, and I’ve never had any issues with anxiety. I’m a pretty… grounded individual, I suppose you could say. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a few years, admittedly, but the last one showed everything was in good working order. I lead a fairly active life, working outdoors quite a bit. I've never needed to see a specialist.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Knabenshue. And thank you for being so forthcoming. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I broke my arm as a boy, playing on the reservation, but it healed cleanly with a cast. Aside from that, I've been fortunate enough to avoid any serious injuries or illnesses that would require hospitalization. I’ve always been… careful, I suppose. And a bit lucky. I’ve managed to stay out of the hospital all these years.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any instances of heart disease, lung problems, or anxiety disorders in your immediate family – your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. My mother lived to be 87, and she was as strong as an ox right up until the end. My father passed away younger, from an accident, but he had no known health problems. I have one sister, and she’s perfectly healthy as well. We haven’t had any history of heart disease, lung problems, or anxiety in the family as far as I know. We're a fairly stoic people, if that makes any sense. Don't complain much, even when things are bad.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with medications. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years for minor infections, but never had any side effects. I haven't got any known allergies to speak of. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications at all. Not even over-the-counter things like pain relievers. I prefer to let things heal naturally whenever possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. I try to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest. I avoid medication when I can. I’ve always believed in the body's natural ability to heal itself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. That gives me a good baseline understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your current condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. I understand the need for a proper examination. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and I'll take a look at your chest as well.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Take your time. I’m not in any particular hurry.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to being in the clinic, or simply nerves. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart rhythm is regular, although I'm hearing a slight murmur, which we may want to investigate further down the line. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. No tenderness noted upon palpation of the chest wall. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Oxygen saturation is good at 97%. Now, can you take a deep breath and hold it for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm holding it... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten. There you go. It wasn't particularly difficult, but it's… a little tight in the chest, even without the mask.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. I noticed you did seem to strain a bit holding your breath. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple maneuver. Could you please stand up and take five deep, rapid breaths, followed by a sustained exhale?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Alright, here we go. One... two... three... four... five... whoosh... There. I’m a bit lightheaded now, if I’m being honest. The chest feels… constricted. Perhaps it’s the air in here, Doctor. It feels rather stuffy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. I did notice a slight wheezing sound when you exhaled, and I understand you’re feeling lightheaded. That’s valuable information. Based on the physical exam and your reported symptoms, it seems there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The elevated blood pressure, the slight heart murmur, and the wheezing suggest we should investigate potential underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. However, the fact that these symptoms are specifically triggered by mask wearing is also significant. It’s possible that the mask is exacerbating a pre-existing condition, or even triggering a psychological response. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few further tests. We should start with an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and look for any abnormalities. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. Finally, I think it would be beneficial to perform a spirometry test, which measures your lung function. Would you be comfortable with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very sensible. I trust your judgment completely. I'm happy to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary to get to the bottom of this. I’d like to know what’s going on, and I’d like to be able to do my job without feeling… unwell. So yes, please, let's proceed with the EKG, chest X-ray, and spirometry test. When can we schedule those?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad to hear that. I can schedule the EKG and chest X-ray for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM here at the clinic. The spirometry test can be performed by the respiratory therapist, Ms. Evans, tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that schedule works perfectly. 8:00 AM for the EKG and chest X-ray, and 2:00 PM for the spirometry test. I will make a note of those times. And… just out of curiosity, Doctor, would it be alright if I wore a mask during the EKG, just to see if it has an impact on the results? I understand it may not be ideal, but it might give you some further information.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful suggestion, Mr. Knabenshue. Yes, absolutely. We can certainly try wearing a mask during the EKG to see if it affects the readings. It could provide valuable insight into whether the mask is directly contributing to any changes in your heart rhythm. We will document that carefully. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding mask wearing as much as possible until we have the results of these tests. It’s important not to exacerbate your symptoms further. Are there any questions you have for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate your thoughtful approach and your willingness to listen to my concerns. I feel much better knowing we're taking these steps to figure out what’s going on. I’ll be here tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM for the EKG and chest X-ray, and then again at 2:00 PM for the spirometry test. Thank you again for your time and attention, Doctor Shely. I look forward to seeing you then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow as well. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before then. Have a good rest of your day, and I'll see you tomorrow. .
