DOCTOR: Hi Margret, good morning! It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. My name is Margret Kilton. I… I have been having trouble with my breathing. A little bit of wheezing, you see. It is not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Margret, I understand. Trouble breathing and some wheezing. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It happens mostly when I… when I walk fast. Or if I try to lift something heavy. It is not all the time, but it is enough to worry me a little. I used to be very strong, you see. I am an athletic trainer. Or was, before my… before. But the breathing… it makes me tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be brought on by exertion – walking quickly or lifting things. And it’s making you feel tired. That’s good information. When did this start happening, Margret?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started, maybe… three months ago? It was very slow, at first. Just a little bit out of breath. I thought it was just getting old, you see. But it is getting worse. Not very fast, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months ago, starting slowly and gradually getting worse. And you said it’s making you feel tired. Besides the tiredness and shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Sometimes, my chest feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing it. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And I cough a little bit, but not a bad cough. Mostly just when I try to sleep. It’s a dry cough, you see. No… nothing comes up.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness and a dry cough, especially when you’re lying down. That’s helpful. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma… no, I don't think so. Never been told. My mother… she had a cough a lot when she was old, but I don't think it was asthma. Bronchitis… maybe once, when I was a young girl. Very long time ago. I was sick for a week. Pneumonia… no, never had that. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat good food and walk every day, when I can.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold or the flu – leading up to when this breathing trouble started?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. I had a bad cold in… February, I think. It lasted almost two weeks. A very bad one. I was in bed for many days. But I thought I got better. It was just a cold, you see. But maybe… maybe that is connected to the breathing?
DOCTOR: Possibly. A cold can sometimes trigger things like this. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, pollen, animals?
PATIENT: I don't think so. I eat everything! My husband… he was allergic to peanuts, very bad allergy. But I never had any problems. I like cats, but I don't have one. I don’t take many medicines either. Just a little something for my knee sometimes, you see. It gets sore when the weather is cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just something for your knee occasionally. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions you do have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my knee, like I said. Arthritis, the doctor told me. And… I had a problem with my heart many years ago. Not a serious problem, they said. Just a little flutter sometimes. They gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them a long time ago. They said it was okay. I don't go to the doctor very often, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis in your knee and a history of a heart flutter that was treated and resolved. We’ll make a note of that. Do you have any family history of heart disease, lung problems, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had a very bad heart. He died when he was young, from a heart attack. And my sister… she had asthma when she was a child, but she grew out of it. And my mother, she had… I think she had emphysema, the doctor said. She smoked many cigarettes, you see. It was very bad for her.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, asthma, and emphysema. That's important information. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I do not smoke. My husband smoked, very bad habit, but I never liked it. I always told him to stop, but he never did. I always liked fresh air, you see. Very important for the lungs.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Not very much. Maybe two glasses a week. It helps me relax, you see. I don't drink very often. And I don't drink hard liquor, never liked it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little wine occasionally. And finally, do you work, or are you retired?
PATIENT: I am retired now. I was an athletic trainer. For many years. I helped many people. But my breathing… it makes it hard to do much now. I try to walk every day, but it is not the same, you see. I miss it very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Margret, thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and maybe check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just want to be able to breathe easier, you see. It is very important for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a few deep breaths in and out for me, please. I'm going to listen to your lungs first. Okay… I am hearing some wheezing on both sides, but more pronounced on the right side. And your heart sounds a little bit fast, but regular. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little bit low, but not critically low. Based on what you've told me and what I've heard, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – possibly related to your history of a cold and your family history. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I want to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: COPD… that sounds… serious. My mother had something like that, I think. A bad cough and trouble breathing, you see. A chest X-ray and a… what did you call it? A pulmonary function test? Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. If that is what we need to do to find out what is wrong, then yes. I just want to feel better, you see. It is hard to breathe, and it worries me. When would we do these tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Margret. It’s good we’re being proactive. COPD can be serious, but it's also very manageable with treatment. The pulmonary function test is just a breathing test that measures how well your lungs are working. It’s completely non-invasive. We can get the chest X-ray done today, right here at the clinic. And I can schedule the pulmonary function test for you next week, at the hospital. Does Tuesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes, that sounds good. I am free on Tuesday. The hospital is not very far, is it? I can drive myself, you see. I still have my license. And… what will happen if they find something? What is the treatment for this… COPD? Is it… painful? I worry about being in pain, you see. I have always been very healthy, and I don't like being sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday afternoon it is. The hospital is about a 15-minute drive from here. Now, if the tests confirm a diagnosis of COPD, the treatment typically involves medications – usually inhalers – to help open up your airways and reduce inflammation. There are different types of inhalers, and we’ll find the one that works best for you. Sometimes, pulmonary rehabilitation – a program of exercise and education – is also recommended. The treatment itself isn’t painful. You might experience some mild side effects from the medications – like a slightly faster heartbeat or some shakiness – but those are usually temporary and manageable. We'll discuss all the potential side effects and how to manage them. The goal of treatment is to help you breathe easier, improve your quality of life, and prevent the condition from getting worse. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inhalers… that sounds… not so bad. Better than being in pain, you see. And exercise… I still like to walk, when I can. Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. I am ready to do whatever it takes to feel better. I trust you to take good care of me. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. When should I expect to hear about the results of the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. The radiologist usually gets the X-ray results back to me within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as I've reviewed them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please don't hesitate to call the office. I'm also going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to use in the meantime, just to help relieve some of your wheezing. It's a rescue inhaler, so you only use it when you're feeling short of breath. I'll send that prescription to your pharmacy now. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A rescue inhaler… that sounds good. Something to help me when I need it. Yes, that is good. And you will send it to the pharmacy? I use… Green Valley Pharmacy, on Main Street. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better knowing that we are doing something about this. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Margret. I’ve sent the prescription to Green Valley Pharmacy. They should have it ready for you later today. It was my pleasure. I'm happy to help. Remember, we'll get the chest X-ray done, then we'll schedule the pulmonary function test for next week, and we'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any trouble walking to your car, or would you like me to call someone to give you a ride?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, thank you. I can walk perfectly fine. Just a little slow, sometimes, you see. I still have my independence. Thank you again for everything. You have been very kind and helpful. I will see you next week. Have a good day.
