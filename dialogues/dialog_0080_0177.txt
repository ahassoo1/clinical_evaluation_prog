DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s embarrassing, really. Something’s… leaking. Down there. It started a few days ago, maybe? I don’t keep good track of things these days. It’s not… pretty. And it smells funny. That’s why I came. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things happen, and we're here to figure it out. It’s good you came in. “Leaking,” you said, and it started a few days ago. Can you tell me a little more about the leakage?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a… a flood, you know? Just… drops. Sometimes more than others. And it’s… yellowish. A little sticky, too. I tried wiping it, but it just keeps coming back. Honestly, I don't know why it’s happening. I haven't… well, it’s been a long time since… anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, a little sticky, and intermittent. That helps. And you mentioned it’s been a long time since any sexual activity, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A very long time. Before… before my husband passed. That was… oh, goodness, twenty years now? More? It doesn’t matter. I haven't been with anyone since. So it can’t be from that, can it? It must be something else. Something… old.
DOCTOR: No, it definitely doesn't sound like a sexually transmitted infection then, Jimmi. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Sometimes these things are related to changes over time. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmmm… let me think. Well… it itches sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… when I move around too much, I guess. And it feels… sore. Like a little scrape, maybe? It’s not a bad pain, just… annoying. And I’ve been… a little tired lately, but who isn’t, these days?
DOCTOR: Okay, itching with movement and a sore feeling, like a scrape. And you've been feeling a little tired. Let's talk a bit more about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, my knees ache something awful. Been that way for years. The doctor told me it’s just… old age. Arthritis, he said. I take some pills for it, but they don't help much. And I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really get sick. Just the aches and pains of getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and a gallbladder removal in the past. And you generally feel pretty healthy otherwise. Have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I’ve broken a bone or two in my life, falling mostly. But those healed up just fine. I'm tough, you know? Chamorro women are strong. We have to be. But this… this leaking is just… undignified.
DOCTOR: You are tough, Jimmi, I can tell. And I understand your frustration. Okay, let’s talk about your family. Is there a history of any medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother had diabetes. She lost her legs, poor thing. And my father… he had heart trouble. A lot of heart trouble. They both… passed away a long time ago. My brother’s still alive, but he lives on Guam. We don’t talk much anymore. He’s a stubborn one. Other than that… not really. Mostly just… old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of diabetes and heart trouble in your family. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, and also any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. For my knees, I take… hmm. Ibuprofen, I think. The little white pills. Sometimes two, sometimes three. I don't really keep track. And… that’s it. I don’t take much. As for allergies… well, I think I’m allergic to bee stings. I got stung when I was a little girl and swelled up something awful. But that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung since.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees, and a bee sting allergy. Thank you. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your social habits, if that's alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, since my husband passed, maybe? It didn't sit right with me after he was gone. And drugs? Heavens, no. I’m a church lady, Doctor. We don't do those things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Jimmi. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to take a look at the area you're concerned about. We’ll also check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. It's not something I want to do, but I want to find out what’s wrong. Just be quick about it, please. And gentle. It’s… a sensitive area.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle and quick as possible, Jimmi. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. We'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, could I take a look at the area of concern?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. Just… try not to stare, please. It’s embarrassing enough as it is. And be quick, like I said. This is… not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just taking a look now. I do see some mild redness and a small amount of yellowish discharge. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling or open sores, which is good. I’m also going to gently palpate the area to check for any tenderness or masses. There is some mild tenderness to touch, but no obvious masses. Based on what I'm seeing and feeling, it could be a mild case of vulvovaginitis – an inflammation of the vulva and vagina. It's common, especially as we get older. It can be caused by a variety of things, including changes in hormone levels, irritation from soaps or detergents, or even just dryness. To be sure, I’d like to do a simple test to check for a yeast or bacterial infection. It involves a quick swab. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Oh, dear. Is it… painful? I don't like things poking around down there. But if it'll help figure out what's wrong… alright. Go ahead. Just be quick about it, please. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will explain everything as I go. It’s a very quick and generally painless procedure, Jimmi. I’m just going to use a small cotton swab to collect a sample of the discharge. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. Okay, I’m just going to insert the swab gently for a few seconds to collect a sample… There. All done. Now we’ll send this sample to the lab, and it should take a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding harsh soaps or douches in that area, and wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No harsh soaps... alright, I can do that. I mostly use that Ivory soap, is that okay? It’s gentle, I think. And cotton underwear… always. I wouldn’t wear anything else. It’s just… uncomfortable. A couple of days, you said? That seems like a long time to wait. What if it gets worse?
DOCTOR: Ivory soap is a good choice, Jimmi, it’s generally very gentle. And yes, cotton is always best. A couple of days is a bit of a wait, I know. But it’s the fastest way to get a definitive answer so we can treat the problem correctly. If it does get worse – if you experience increased pain, itching, or a foul odor – please call the office right away, and we’ll get you seen sooner. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend a topical cream to help soothe the irritation and relieve some of the discomfort. It’s a mild steroid cream, and it’s available over-the-counter. Do you have a preference for a particular brand?
PATIENT: A cream… alright. I don't really have a preference, as long as it doesn’t smell too strong. I can’t stand those overly perfumed lotions. They give me a headache. Something plain, I guess? Like… Cortisone 10? Is that a good one? I think I’ve used that before for a rash.
DOCTOR: Cortisone 10 is a perfectly good choice, Jimmi. It's plain and generally well-tolerated. You can find it at any pharmacy. Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice a day for a week. And if the symptoms don't improve after a week, let me know. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… a couple of days, you said? I hope it’s not something too serious. I'm getting too old for all this trouble. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results are back. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Alright. You have a good day too, Doctor. And thank you again. I'll call if anything changes. .
