DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Blim. So, let's get right to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. And how long precisely is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably about three or four months now. At first, I didn’t really pay it much attention, honestly. I just figured it was something temporary, maybe from lifting something heavy. But it hasn’t gone away, and if anything, it feels… a little bigger now.
DOCTOR: Right. And has it been causing you any pain, discomfort, or any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. More like… a dull ache sometimes. It’s not constant, and it’s not severe. And no other symptoms that I've noticed. No fever, no changes in my bathroom habits, nothing like that. Just the lump and the occasional ache.
DOCTOR: I see. And your weight has been stable, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty stable. I'm about 129 pounds, and that hasn't changed much in the last few months. I try to eat fairly healthily, and I walk most days. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost or gained any noticeable weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of this mass. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to palpate your abdomen. Try to relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I will do my best to relax. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Now, I am going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness or discomfort at any point. Hmm. It appears to be approximately three centimeters in diameter, slightly firm, and mobile. Not acutely tender to the touch. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any serious underlying pathology. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work seem like a good idea to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Do you know roughly when I can expect the results?
DOCTOR: The lab work should be available within 24 to 48 hours. The CT scan… well, the radiology department is quite busy. Let’s say within three to five business days. We'll review them together then. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden onset of pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, you are to present to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand completely. Lab work in a couple of days, CT scan within a week, and go to the emergency room if I experience sudden pain, fever, or nausea. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your thoroughness. Is there anything else I should be doing or watching out for in the meantime?
DOCTOR: No. Simply monitor for any changes in symptoms. Avoid strenuous activity that might exacerbate discomfort. I trust you are capable of recognizing if something is amiss. We will discuss the results when they become available. Do you have any other questions before I have other patients waiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything so clearly. I will keep an eye on it and contact you if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the necessary lab requisitions and CT scan order. Have a… satisfactory day, Mr. Raghunathan. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
