DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my sight. It’s not what it used to be, naturally. One expects some decline at my age, but this feels… faster than it ought to be, if you understand what I mean. It’s rather inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Alcorta. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Faster than it ought to be” is a very helpful description. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, can you tell me more specifically what you’ve been noticing?
PATIENT: Well, things just aren’t… sharp. You know? Like looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps. And at night… driving has become a real ordeal. The glare from other vehicles… it’s quite distracting. It’s not a complete blur, mind you. I can still see, it’s just… diminished. I suppose. It’s hard to explain without resorting to technical terms, and I don’t pretend to be a medical man.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. “Diminished” and the dirty window description are very helpful. And the glare at night is important. Is this something that has come on gradually, or did you notice a sudden change?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, as I don’t spend a great deal of time meticulously observing my vision, if you catch my meaning. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe longer. It’s not like I woke up one morning and couldn’t see at all. Just… a slow fading, like an old photograph. It’s rather frustrating, honestly. A man relies on his senses, doesn't he?
DOCTOR: He certainly does. Okay, so gradual onset over roughly six months. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. No pain, no floaters, no… flashes of light or anything dramatic like that. Just the… fuzziness, and the increased sensitivity to bright lights. Though, now that I mention it, I seem to be bumping into things a bit more often. Perhaps I’m just becoming clumsier in my old age, though. It’s difficult to say. My wife always said I had no spatial awareness, but she’s… well, that’s another matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no floaters, no flashes, increased sensitivity to light, and some increased bumping into things. That's good information. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Bifocals. Have for… oh, fifteen years, at least. The prescription hasn’t been changed in quite some time, though. I suppose I should have been more diligent about getting them checked, but I've always been a man who avoids unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. And when was the last time you had a comprehensive eye exam – meaning not just a prescription check, but a full exam of the health of your eyes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t tell you. It’s been… a long time. Perhaps ten years ago? More? I simply go to the optical shop for new lenses when the old ones become scratched or the prescription feels outdated. I’ve never bothered with a “comprehensive” exam. Seemed rather… excessive, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do. Okay, so it’s been quite a while since a full exam. That’s alright, we can get that done today. To get a better overall picture, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I’ve always been a fairly robust individual. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. As I got older, I developed hypertension – high blood pressure – about twenty years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for the most part. I also had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back, but that resolved with antibiotics. Beyond that, nothing of significant note. I don’t smoke, and I drink only occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension controlled with medication, and a history of diverticulitis. That’s helpful. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. And I also take a low-dose Aspirin, just as a preventative measure. My doctor recommended it a few years ago. And… that’s it, I believe. I pride myself on taking only what is absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and low-dose Aspirin. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’m not particularly prone to allergies in general, thankfully. A bit of a sniffle with hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced any eye problems, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she developed cataracts in her later years, I believe. She had surgery for them, and seemed to regain most of her sight afterward. My father had… well, he had some sort of… general failing health in his old age, but I don’t recall anything specific about his eyes. My siblings… I don't believe so. We weren't particularly close, to be honest, and medical details weren't often discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had cataracts. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your eyes. It won't be overly involved, just a basic assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. I understand it’s necessary. Though, I must confess, I’ve always been a bit… apprehensive about anything involving bright lights and close proximity to one’s eyes. But proceed as you see fit. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. First, I'm going to check your visual acuity – that's your ability to see at different distances. Just read the smallest letters you can on this chart. Starting with both eyes together, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Let me see… E… F… P… T… Oh, goodness. It’s rather small, isn’t it? L… and… is that a D? Yes, I believe so. L…D… That’s about as far as I can discern. It’s… blurry, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives us a starting point. Now, let’s check each eye individually. Cover your left eye with your hand, please. And again, just read the smallest letters you can. Don't strain, just tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Alright. E… F… P… T… L… I can make out the L. And… perhaps a D? It’s… slightly clearer than with both eyes, but still not particularly sharp. Yes, definitely a D. Though, I confess, it requires considerable effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, cover your right eye and we’ll check your left eye.
PATIENT: Alright. Let me see… This is… E… F… P… I can’t quite make out the T. Perhaps a V? No… it’s too blurry. Definitely not the T. It’s… significantly less clear than the other eye. I’m having a rather difficult time with this one, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I'm going to have you focus on this point here , and I’ll gently move something into your field of vision from the side. Just tell me when you see it. We'll start with both eyes open.
PATIENT: Very well. I am focusing on the point, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I must confess, this all feels rather… disconcerting. I do hope it’s not indicative of something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m moving something into your field of vision now... Can you see anything?
PATIENT: I… I believe I can perceive something on the left side… very faintly. It’s… a blur, more than a distinct object. And… it’s rather late appearing. It’s not immediate, Doctor. It takes… a considerable effort to register it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I’m going to switch to your right eye.
PATIENT: Proceed, Doctor. I am concentrating on the point. This… is not a comfortable experience, I must say. My eyes are beginning to feel strained.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you see anything now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I can’t perceive anything at all. It’s… completely dark on the periphery. It's as if a curtain has been drawn. This… is rather worrying, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Alcorta. Now, I’m going to check the front of your eyes with a light and a magnifying instrument. It won't be painful, but I’ll need to get fairly close.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. Though, I must reiterate, I am not particularly fond of things being placed near my eyes. It triggers a rather unpleasant reflex. But I trust your competence. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax and look straight ahead. I'm looking at your optic nerve and your retina now... Okay. I see some mild lens changes consistent with your age, but nothing overly concerning there. Your optic nerves look relatively healthy, though I do note some narrowing of the peripheral retinal vessels in both eyes. It’s subtle, but it’s worth noting. Given your symptoms – the gradual vision loss, the glare sensitivity, the peripheral vision loss, and what I’m seeing during the exam – I’m concerned about possible glaucoma or early cataracts. The narrowing of your retinal vessels also warrants further investigation to rule out any vascular issues.
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Cataracts? Vascular issues? Good heavens. Those sound… rather serious, Doctor. I always suspected something was amiss, naturally, but I hadn't anticipated… this. What… what does this mean, precisely? And what do we do about it? I trust there are options available, aren't there? I'm not quite ready for… well, for complete blindness, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Alcorta. It's good you're taking this seriously. Let's break it down. Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure inside the eye. If left untreated, it can lead to vision loss. Cataracts are clouding of the natural lens of the eye, which is common as we age. And the narrowing of the retinal vessels could be a sign of underlying vascular disease, which can also affect vision. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, though. These are possibilities based on my initial examination. To get a definitive diagnosis, we need to do some further testing. I’m going to order a visual field test – that will assess your peripheral vision more precisely. I also want to measure the pressure inside your eyes – that’s called tonometry. Finally, I’d like you to see an ophthalmologist – a specialist in eye care – for a more comprehensive evaluation, including a dilated eye exam and possibly an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan, which provides detailed images of the retina. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A visual field test… tonometry… an ophthalmologist… It sounds… rather extensive, Doctor. And frankly, quite daunting. But I suppose there’s no avoiding it, if it’s necessary to ascertain the extent of the problem. Yes, proceed with the testing. Schedule the appointments, whatever is required. I trust you’ll guide me through the process. And… perhaps you could provide me with some literature on these conditions? I prefer to be… informed, if you understand. It helps to alleviate the anxiety, naturally. And, if you wouldn’t mind, please let me know the cost of these procedures beforehand. I’m… not particularly well-insured, as you may have gathered.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I completely understand your concerns and your desire to be informed. I'll have my assistant schedule the visual field test for you as soon as possible – it usually takes about 30-45 minutes. And I’ll send you a referral to a very good ophthalmologist in town. I will also have the assistant print out some information packets on glaucoma and cataracts for you. Regarding cost, I’ll have the assistant call both the testing center and the ophthalmologist's office to get you an estimate. Since you’re uninsured, we can also explore options for financial assistance or payment plans, if needed. In the meantime, it's important to remember that early detection and treatment can significantly improve the outcome. Try not to worry too much, and we'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That… is reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for the comprehensive explanation and the offer of assistance. I do appreciate it. Just one question, if you don’t mind. If… if it is glaucoma, as you suspect, is it… progressive? Will my vision continue to deteriorate, regardless of treatment? I understand this may be a… difficult question, but I prefer to be prepared, if you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Alcorta, and I appreciate you asking it directly. Glaucoma can be progressive, yes. However, with early detection and consistent treatment, we can often slow down or even halt the progression of the disease. The treatment typically involves eye drops to lower the pressure inside the eye. In some cases, laser therapy or surgery may be necessary. It's also important to understand that the rate of progression varies from person to person. Some people experience very slow progression, while others may progress more quickly. The key is to follow the treatment plan diligently and to have regular check-ups to monitor your vision. We’ll work closely together to manage the condition and to preserve as much of your vision as possible. Does that help clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that… is somewhat reassuring. Slowing the progression is… preferable to unchecked deterioration, naturally. Regular check-ups and consistent treatment… I can certainly commit to that. I'm not one to shirk responsibility, Doctor. Very well. Please proceed with the scheduling. And thank you again for your time and your… candor. I’m grateful for your assistance. I suppose I’ll… wait to hear from your assistant regarding the appointments. Unless there’s anything else you require of me at this time?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Alcorta, that’s all for today. My assistant will be in touch shortly with the appointment details and information about costs and financial assistance. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and we’ll get this sorted out. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And… thank you again for your time and your… expertise. Good day.
