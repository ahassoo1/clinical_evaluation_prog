DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been noticing a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… there. And it’s a little concerning.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A mass in your lower abdomen, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It's… hard to describe the size. Maybe a little bigger than a golf ball? It’s not growing quickly, I don’t think so, but it hasn’t gone away either.
DOCTOR: Okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is this located?
PATIENT: If you don’t mind me being specific, it’s sort of… to the left of my belly button, and a little bit down. It's not right on the surface, you have to feel for it. I wasn't sure if it was just something I was imagining at first, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. So, left lower quadrant, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right, the left lower quadrant. I… I don’t know much about anatomy, but that seems to be where it is. I apologize if I’m not being very precise.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, you’re doing just fine. Let's get a better understanding of this. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this mass?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the strange thing. No pain, no changes in my bowel habits, no fever… nothing else. I’ve been feeling my usual self, otherwise. It just… feels different, you know? A little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, I understand. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Let’s go through some general health questions, and then I’ll need to examine you. Have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never needed anything like that, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I try to stay healthy – eat well, get some exercise when I can with my work, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what sort of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a choreographer. Mostly dance, some theatrical movement pieces. It keeps me busy, and on my feet. It’s a lot of physical work, surprisingly. Though not always consistent, depending on projects, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, a choreographer. Physically demanding, certainly. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… some issues with her stomach, when she was older. Nothing diagnosed specifically, just… digestive problems, frequently. My father was healthy as could be, lived a long life. I don't know much beyond that, to be honest. My family isn’t really one for talking about medical history. It’s a bit of a taboo topic.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. I’ve only taken over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches, and never had any issues with those. I’m generally quite healthy, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to try and get everything I need from my diet, if possible. I’ve never been much of a pill-taker. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven't been consistent with it lately. It's been months, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Raghunathan, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then palpate it – gently feel around – to get a better sense of this mass. Please lie back on the exam table, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I trust your judgment, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, regarding the mass... yes, I can feel something firm in your left lower quadrant. It’s approximately the size you described, maybe a little larger. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, which is good. There doesn't appear to be any guarding or rebound tenderness, either. Is it painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt, actually. It’s just… noticeable. Like a solid lump. It’s not sharp pain, or anything like that, just… something is there. It feels more internal than surface-level, if that makes sense. It’s a little strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. It does feel deeper, yes, that's consistent with what you're saying. Well, Mr. Raghunathan, based on the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what this mass is. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a benign cyst, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An abdominal ultrasound would be a good starting point to visualize the mass and determine its characteristics. We may also need a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I trust your expertise, and I want to get to the bottom of this. An ultrasound and blood tests… absolutely. Do you have everything you need to order those? Should I schedule something with the front desk?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can get the orders sent over electronically to the lab and imaging center. The front desk will contact you to schedule the ultrasound and blood draw. I’ll also want to review your results as soon as they’re available, so please let them know you’d like me to be notified. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and thorough examination. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. I'll be sure to let the front desk know to notify you with the results. And I will contact you immediately if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. You’re welcome. I’m glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this, don’t worry. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I'll see you when the results are in. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You as well.
