DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Oh… well, it’s… something with my waterworks, I suppose. It keeps… bothering me. It’s been happening on and off, you see. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, to be honest. It feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, alright. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, it… it burns when I go to the toilet. And I have to go very often. More often than I should, I think. It’s… disruptive. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining. It’s just… a feeling. A bad feeling.
DOCTOR: A burning sensation and increased frequency. Okay. Is there any pain between bathroom visits, or just when you're actually going?
PATIENT: No, not… not really between times. It’s mostly when I… when I need to go. A little ache sometimes, but not… not a bad pain. Just… a warning, I suppose. It's hard to say, you know? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any blood in your urine, or have you noticed any changes in the color or smell?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen. It looks… normal, I suppose. As normal as it ever does. And the smell… I haven’t really paid attention to the smell, I’m afraid. I just… I just want it to stop bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don’t believe so. I haven't felt warm, and I haven’t been shivering. And my back… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know? I can’t say it’s worse than usual. It’s just… a general ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you had any urinary problems in the past?
PATIENT: Urinary problems… Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I think I had something like this a long time ago. Years and years ago. Maybe… maybe with my late husband? I don’t remember the details, I’m afraid. It was a very long time ago. Perhaps I went to a doctor then, but I honestly couldn't tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history in general. Do you have any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic… Oh, my. Well, the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, years back. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to make much difference, and I didn’t like taking pills. Aside from that… no, not that I know of. I used to be very healthy, very active. Now… well, now I’m just old.
DOCTOR: And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had any trouble with… anything. I eat most things. I used to love shellfish, but I haven’t eaten that in years. Not for any allergy reason, just… didn't fancy it anymore.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can. I used to take something for my joints, but it didn’t help much, so I stopped. Just… nothing at all. I prefer to let things… sort themselves out, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your abdomen and back, and then I'd like to do a quick urine test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a test? Yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do, you see. A little listening and a little… sample. Yes, alright. Just… be quick, please?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to the touch. Your back feels… a little tight, as you mentioned, but nothing alarming. Now, if you could just provide a urine sample for me. There’s a cup in the restroom. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy.
PATIENT: Right. A sample… Yes, alright. A mid-stream… Oh dear. I remember being told that years ago. Yes. I’ll… I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, let's see what this tells us… It appears you have a urinary tract infection, Claudene. That explains the burning sensation and frequent urination.
PATIENT: An infection…? Oh. That's… unpleasant. Is it… serious? What does that mean, Doctor? Will I have to… stay here? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately serious, Claudene, but it does need treatment. If left untreated, it can become more problematic. No, you won't need to stay here. We can treat it with antibiotics. It's a simple course of medication you'll take at home. I’m going to prescribe you Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day for seven days. It’s a common antibiotic for UTIs. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… seven days. Yes, alright. I’ll try to remember. Twice a day… morning and evening? And… what if I do feel better after a few days? Should I stop then? I really don’t like taking pills, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Claudene, do not stop if you feel better after a few days. The infection needs to be completely eradicated, or it can come back, and it can become resistant to the antibiotic. Seven days, twice a day. Morning and evening. Understand?
PATIENT: Morning and evening… for seven days. Even if I feel alright. Yes. Alright. I understand. It’s just… a lot to remember. Will it… make me feel unwell? Do I have any side effects to look out for?
DOCTOR: Some people experience mild nausea or a loss of appetite, Claudene. It's usually nothing serious. If you develop a rash, severe stomach pain, or difficulty breathing, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or go to the emergency room. But those are rare side effects. It's more likely you’ll feel better after a few days on the antibiotics. I’ll also recommend drinking plenty of water—at least eight glasses a day—to help flush out the infection. Avoid caffeine and alcohol while you’re on the medication. And… try to urinate frequently, even if you don’t feel the urge. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Plenty of water… no caffeine or alcohol. More frequent… alright. That’s… a lot to keep in mind. No, I don’t think so. Just… try to remember everything. The pills, the water, no… drinks. I suppose that’s all? Can I go home now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Claudene, you can go home now. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of your medication and instructions for you to take with you. If you don’t feel any improvement after three days on the antibiotics, or if your symptoms worsen, please contact the clinic immediately. And, honestly Claudene, I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a month just to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Do you have any transportation arranged?
PATIENT: Follow-up… oh dear. Another appointment… I think my daughter can take me. Yes, she usually does. I suppose I should ask her to schedule it. Alright. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that’s everything. And thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Claudene. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Goodbye. Thank you again. Pills… water… no drinks… follow-up… oh dear.
