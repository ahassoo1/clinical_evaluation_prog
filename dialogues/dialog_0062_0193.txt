DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor DeCosta. It is... a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I am having a problem with... passing gas. A lot of it. More than usual, you understand? It is causing me some... discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s definitely not something to be embarrassed about – digestive issues are very common. "More than usual" is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it happens… almost all the time now. After I eat, certainly. But also… just sitting, or walking. It doesn’t seem to matter. And the… smell is not always pleasant, if I may be so frank. It’s been going on for maybe… two weeks now? Perhaps a little longer. I am not sure of the exact date. It is a gradual thing, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been going on for around two weeks, gradually worsening, and it’s happening regardless of eating or activity. And you're noticing a change in the odor. That's helpful information. Aside from the discomfort and odor, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No… no pain, exactly. Sometimes a little… bloated feeling, after a meal. But not always. And… no change in my… bowel habits, if you understand. Everything else is… normal, I suppose. I have not lost my appetite. And… no fever, or anything like that. Just the… gas. It is mostly just… inconvenient, and… a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no changes in bowel movements, no loss of appetite, no fever – just bloating sometimes, along with the increased gas. That helps me narrow things down. Now, let’s talk a little bit about what you’ve been eating. Has there been any change in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Change in diet… not really. I eat mostly the same things. I work at the… the burger place, you see. So, sometimes I have a little of that for lunch. But I always have… I eat a sandwich most days. And… soup, sometimes. I drink… water. I do not drink much soda. I have not tried any new foods recently, no. Nothing at all, I believe. It is quite… routine, my eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine diet… mostly sandwiches and soup, with occasional lunch from work. And you drink water. That's good to know. Now, sometimes these things can be related to medications or supplements. Are you currently taking any vitamins, over-the-counter medications, or anything prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. I take… Medicare, you understand. They give me a little… pill for my blood pressure. A small, white one. I take it every morning. And… sometimes, for my joints. They ache a little, you see. A brown one. Just when they are bad. But that is… not very often. I do not take anything else, I believe. Just those two. And… the Medicare gives me some vitamins, sometimes. A small, orange one, I think. But not every month.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking a pill for blood pressure daily, a brown pill for joint pain as needed, and occasionally an orange vitamin from Medicare. That's helpful. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, or anything else related to your digestive system?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history. I… I had pneumonia, when I was younger. A long time ago. And… my joints, you see. That is why I take the brown pill. But… no. No, I do not believe I have ever been told I have any problem with my… stomach. Or my intestines. No irritable… what did you say? No lactose… I drink milk, sometimes. It does not bother me. I have never been told I have any of those conditions, no. The doctor… he just said my joints are old. It is to be expected, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pneumonia, and some joint issues. No prior diagnoses related to your digestive system. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… Ah, yes. When I was a boy, I had my… my tonsils out. A long time ago. And… when I broke my arm, I had a cast. But no… no other surgeries. Nothing else at all, I believe. Just the tonsils. And the cast. It was many years ago, you understand. Not recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm that required a cast. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with similar digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or Celiac disease?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother… she had a little trouble with her… stomach, sometimes. But I do not know what it was. She just… ate slowly, and complained a little. And my father… he was a strong man. He never complained about anything. I do not think anyone in my family had… what did you say? Irritable… No, I do not believe so. No one had any serious trouble with their stomach, no. They all ate… normally, you understand. Not any special diets or anything like that. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some general stomach complaints, but no specific diagnoses. And your father had no digestive issues. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in any regular exercise?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And… I do not drink alcohol. It does not agree with me. And… exercise. Well, I walk to work. And… I stand a lot at the burger place. Is that exercise? It is… not strenuous, you understand. But I am on my feet for many hours. That is all. I do not… go to the gym, or anything like that. Just walking. And standing. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Walking and standing count as activity, definitely. Alright, Jammal, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope and gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness or bloating. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I want to find out what is causing this… discomfort. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they sound active, which is good. I'm feeling your abdomen now… there's a little tenderness when I press here but no significant bloating or masses. Overall, it doesn’t seem to be anything alarming, but the tenderness is worth noting. It's likely related to gas, but we’ll want to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Yes, that is… a little uncomfortable. Just there, you see. It is not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It comes and goes, you understand. Perhaps it is just the gas. But I am glad you checked. It is reassuring to know you have examined me. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I worry, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jammal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it's unlikely to be anything serious. The most common cause of increased gas and discomfort, especially with a change in odor, is related to diet or changes in your gut bacteria. It could be something as simple as a temporary imbalance. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order a few tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count to rule out any infection. Also, I’d like to check a stool sample for any bacteria or parasites that might be causing the gas. Finally, we can do a simple breath test to check for lactose intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth . Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help to determine the cause, then I am happy to have them. A blood test, a stool sample… and a breath test. I do not mind. What will these tests involve? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it is not too long. I would like to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood test will just involve a simple needle prick, and we’ll take that right here in the office. For the stool sample, I’ll give you a kit and instructions to collect a small sample at home – it’s very straightforward. And the breath test involves breathing into a bag at specific intervals after drinking a special solution. We’ll schedule that for another day. The results typically take about 3-5 business days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying a few things to see if they help. First, try avoiding foods that are known to cause gas, like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and carbonated drinks. Second, try eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. And third, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water. If you experience any worsening symptoms, like severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool, please contact me immediately. Does that all sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. No beans, broccoli, or cabbage. Smaller meals, and plenty of water. And I will contact you if anything… worsens. The tests sound… a little unpleasant, but I understand they are necessary. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… patience. It is reassuring to have a doctor who listens. When can we schedule the breath test, do you think? And… is there anything else I should be doing, in the meantime? Perhaps a specific… over-the-counter remedy?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jammal. I’m glad I can help. We can schedule the breath test for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Next Tuesday at 10:00 AM is… perfectly suitable. That gives me time to… prepare. And to avoid the… offending foods. Thank you for accommodating me. I believe that is everything for today, then? I have no further questions at this time. I await the results with… anticipation.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, we’re all set for Tuesday at 10:00 AM. I’ll have the nurse give you the instructions for the stool sample and the breath test, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. In the meantime, if you find over-the-counter remedies helpful, simethicone can help reduce bloating and gas. Just follow the instructions on the label. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Jammal.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor DeCosta. Thank you again for your… kindness and attention. I will follow your instructions carefully, and I will be in touch if… necessary. I appreciate your… professionalism. Have a good day. .
