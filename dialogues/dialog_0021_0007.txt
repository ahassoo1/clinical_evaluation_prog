DOCTOR: Well, hello Lakiya. Nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is…pain. A lot of pain. In my back. It started…well, I remember exactly when, July 14th. It hasn’t gone away. I work hard, you see. Fence work. It’s…heavy.
DOCTOR: Right, July 14th. That’s…a little while ago now. Fence work, heavy lifting…okay. And is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s…mostly constant. Worse when I move. Bending is…difficult. Lifting, even lighter things, is painful. There are times, when I am resting, it is…less. But it never truly goes away, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant, worsened with movement, better with rest. And bending and lifting are particularly troublesome. Is the pain localized to one spot, or does it radiate anywhere – like down your legs, perhaps?
PATIENT: It stays mostly in my lower back. Sometimes…a little ache in my hip. But not down my legs. No. I’ve felt pain in my legs before, from other things, and this is…different. It's a sharp ache. Not a shooting pain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A sharp ache, localized to the lower back, with some hip discomfort. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. I take…what they sell at the store. For aches. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. And I…try to rest when I can. It helps a little, but not much. It doesn't last. I need to work. Bills, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, over-the-counter pain relievers…and rest. Okay. Now, have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No numbness. No tingling. Just…the pain. And it makes it hard to sleep. I toss and turn a lot. I haven’t had a good night’s sleep since…well, since July 14th. It is…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. No numbness or tingling, difficulty sleeping due to the pain. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, osteoporosis, or had any serious back injuries before?
PATIENT: No. Never been told I have arthritis. My grandmother had it, but…not me. And no injuries. Just…usual aches and pains from work. I’ve fallen a few times, nothing broken. Just…bruised. Nothing serious. Medicare pays for most things, you see. I go for checkups. They haven’t said anything about my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses of arthritis or serious back injuries, just typical work-related aches and pains. And Medicare checkups with no mention of back issues. Now, are there any other medical conditions you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure. It runs a little high. I take a pill for it. Small white pill. Doctor gave it to me. Been taking it for…five years, maybe? It’s…under control, usually. It hasn't bothered me with the back pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. Good. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I’ve taken a lot of things over the years. Nothing has ever…bothered me. Not like this pain, anyway. I can’t remember ever being allergic to anything. I’m pretty sure, anyway. I would remember, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table for a moment. We'll check your range of motion and see where the pain is most pronounced.
PATIENT: Alright. That…sounds fine. Just…be gentle, please? It hurts to move. I will…try to tell you where it hurts the most. Is there a gown I should put on?
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s a gown in the changing room. Feel free to change, and then lie down on the table when you’re ready. We’ll take it slow. Just let me know when you're ready.
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll…go change. It’s…in there, right? I’ll be right back. Just…don’t start without me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m…ready when you are. It feels…awkward in this thing.
PATIENT: Okay. Let's get this over with. I'll lie down. Just…tell me what you need me to do. And…be gentle, remember? It's hurting already just from moving.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm just going to feel along your spine, checking for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I'll have you gently bend forward, backward, and to each side. We'll see how far you can comfortably move. Don't push yourself to the point of severe pain, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. I will…try. It's already sore just lying here. Start…wherever you need to. Just…be quick, if you can. This is…uncomfortable. I’m not used to this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gentle pressure. Hmm. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes! That…that spot. Right there. It hurts when you push. A sharp pain. Not a dull ache. And…it feels tight. Like a knot. Can you…feel it? It’s hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some muscle tension there. There’s definitely tenderness to palpation. And how about bending forward now?
PATIENT: Ow! Oh, that’s…bad. I can’t go very far. It feels like…something is blocking me. That’s all I can do. I can’t go any further without…serious pain. It's hurting my legs a little now, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, stop there. No need to push it. And bending backward…how about that?
PATIENT: Same thing. Can’t go far. It’s…tight. Like a board. It’s…not good. I haven’t been able to move like this in weeks. It’s getting worse just from trying. I think…I think that's enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region, limited range of motion in both flexion and extension. I'm also noting some reported discomfort in your legs with movement. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you're experiencing a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by the heavy lifting from your fence work. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a disc issue or nerve compression, I'd like to order some imaging. A lumbar X-ray would be a good starting point. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Imaging? An X-ray? What…what will that show? And will it…hurt? I’m not…keen on having things done if it’s not necessary. I just want it fixed. Is there…something else we can try first? Maybe some stronger pain pills? I need to work, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. An X-ray would help us visualize the bones in your lower back and rule out any fractures or structural abnormalities. It's a relatively simple procedure, no more uncomfortable than a standard dental X-ray. As for pain medication, I can certainly prescribe something stronger than over-the-counter options. However, it’s important to address the underlying cause of the pain, not just mask the symptoms. The X-ray will help me determine the best course of treatment. We can also discuss physical therapy if it shows a muscle strain. Would you like me to go ahead and order the X-ray?
PATIENT: Physical therapy…that sounds…difficult. I work all day. But…if it will help me get better, maybe. But the X-ray…will it take long? And will I have to…go somewhere else? I don’t want to drive all over. I’m…getting tired just thinking about it. Perhaps…perhaps the stronger pills first. Just to see if that helps. If it doesn't…then we can talk about the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your hesitation. While I still recommend the imaging to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I can prescribe a short course of a stronger pain reliever – a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. But please understand this is a temporary solution. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, it’s crucial that we proceed with the X-ray. And you'll need to follow up with me then. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week…that sounds…reasonable. As long as it helps. And if it doesn’t…I’ll come back. Write down the name of the pills, please. And how often I should take them. I write things down…sometimes I forget. A lot. But I remember the date. July 14th, you see. I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day with food. And I’ll write down the instructions clearly here. Take it with food to avoid stomach upset. And if you experience any stomach pain or bleeding, stop taking it immediately and contact me. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just…thank you. For the pills. And for listening. I just want to get back to work. I need to. July 14th…that’s when it all started. Hopefully, these pills will help. I think…I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I hope they do too. And if you do have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. And remember, if the pain worsens, or doesn't improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Take care, Lakiya.
