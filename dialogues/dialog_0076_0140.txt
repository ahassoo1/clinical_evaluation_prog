DOCTOR: Right. Antoine Schieber, 41. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… embarrassing. But my wife insisted. It's a bit of a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see. It's quite bothersome, and frankly, unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Unprofessional, yes, I understand. A white coating… right. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a week, maybe? It doesn’t hurt, precisely. More… irritating. It’s just… there. And it doesn’t go away no matter how much I brush. I assure you, I maintain excellent hygiene.
DOCTOR: Hygiene is…often overstated. A week, hmm. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No, absolutely not. I don’t get fevers. I'm a very healthy man. I work outside, you know. Physical labor. Builds resilience. Though, perhaps a bit of a chill last night. But that was the air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Resilience. Right. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty? No. I eat… normally. Steak, mostly. Though sometimes, it feels… rough, going down. But that’s probably just the cut of meat. Not a delicate man, you see.
DOCTOR: So, a rough sensation… occasionally. Any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Look, I’m a faller. I expect aches. Muscle soreness, yes. But not… in my mouth. It’s just… unpleasant. And it’s affecting my concentration. Important work, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Finally. Get it over with quickly, if you please. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. White coating on the tongue… and some on the buccal mucosa. No obvious lesions. Appears to be thrush, likely. Not life-threatening, obviously. Probably stress-related, or perhaps a minor dietary imbalance. Do you take any antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? No. I don’t take… pills. I’m a strong man, I rely on my constitution. My wife is always suggesting some remedy or another, but I refuse. Honestly, it's a bit ridiculous. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Look, this isn't a matter of "strength". It's a fungal infection. I'll give you a prescription for a mouthwash – Nystatin. Use it twice daily after meals. And try to reduce stress. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients.
PATIENT: “Stress”? Preposterous. I’ll… consider it. Thank you. Though frankly, I doubt it will do much good. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Good day. .
