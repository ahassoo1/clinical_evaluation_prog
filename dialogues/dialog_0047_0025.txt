DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to know… about my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do… a test? With spit? To find out.
DOCTOR: A test… with spit?
PATIENT: Yes, spit. My niece, she told me. She said you take a little bit of spit, and you can find out where your family come from, before… before everything. Like, a long, long time ago. Is that right? I’m Laury, by the way. Everyone calls me Laury.
DOCTOR: Right. Laury, it’s good to meet you. Your niece is likely referring to genetic ancestry testing. It's becoming quite popular. It can give you some information about your family's origins, but it’s not quite as straightforward as just taking a bit of spit and getting a definitive answer. It looks at your DNA, and compares it to databases of populations around the world. It estimates where your ancestors may have come from, based on those comparisons. It's not a perfect science, and the results can sometimes be… ambiguous. Now, are you experiencing any health concerns today, or is this purely for genealogical interest?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Not… perfect. That’s okay. I just want to know. My family, we always on the islands. But before that… I don’t know. No health things, Doctor. Just… curious. Like finding a piece of a puzzle, you know? I feel old, and I want to know where I from before… well, you understand. Medicare will pay for this, yeah? My niece said something about that too.
DOCTOR: Well, Medicare coverage for genetic ancestry testing is… complicated. Generally, they don’t cover it when it’s solely for curiosity’s sake. It needs to be medically necessary – for example, if there was a family history of a genetic condition we were trying to identify a predisposition for. It's unlikely to be covered in your case, Laury, but we can certainly look into it. Before we go any further with that, however, I’d like to get a basic medical history, just to ensure everything is as it should be. You mentioned no health concerns currently, but it’s always good to have a complete picture. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No diabetes. No, nothing like that. My blood pressure… sometimes a little high, but not too bad. Old age, you know? The doctor on the island, he gave me a little pill, white one, but I don’t take it every day. Sometimes I forget. My heart… feels okay. Gets a little tired when I walk up the hill to the store, but… that’s it. I build models, you see. Little boats, little houses. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. A white pill for blood pressure, taken intermittently. We'll need to get the name of that medication, if possible. And building models is excellent! Keeps the mind active. Now, have you been hospitalised for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… Let me think. When I was a young man, maybe. A bad fever, I think. On the island, they didn’t have good medicine then. But… a long time ago. And… that's all. No hospital since then. Just the usual… colds and things. Old man things. I don’t like hospitals. They smell bad.
DOCTOR: A fever in your youth, no hospitalisations since. Good to know. And I understand your aversion to hospitals, Laury. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, no surgeries. Never. I'm a strong man, you see. My father, he said we Marshallese people, we strong. We don’t need surgeries. Just… small cuts, little things. Nothing big. Never been cut open. Never.
DOCTOR: Very well. No surgeries. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: My family… big family. Lots of brothers and sisters. Most of them… gone now. Old age, mostly. I have a few nieces and nephews still on the islands. They have children, grandchildren… I don’t see them much. Islands are far away. My mother, she made beautiful mats. Woven from the leaves. My father… he was a fisherman. A strong fisherman. We always lived near the water. That’s all I really know about them, Doctor. Just… fishermen and weavers.
DOCTOR: Alright. And were there any particular illnesses that ran in your family?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hmm. Old man sickness, I think. They just… got weak. And… some of them had trouble breathing. But that’s just old age, yeah? Maybe… maybe some had trouble with their stomachs? But not like a sickness, just… upset sometimes. It’s hard to say, Doctor. We didn’t have doctors on the islands, not good ones. They just… faded away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. So, no significant family history of illness that you’re aware of. Now, just to finish up this basic medical information, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. I eat everything. Fish, fruit, anything. My mother, she always said a strong man needs strong food. No, no allergies. Never been sick from anything I ate. Maybe a little stomach ache sometimes, but that’s just from eating too much.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from the white pill for your blood pressure that you take occasionally?
PATIENT: Just the white pill. And… sometimes I take something for my joints. They get stiff, you know? Old age. It's a little brown pill. My niece, she sends it to me. I think it helps a little. Sometimes. I forget the name. Lots of pills. Not important. Just old man things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. So, a white pill for blood pressure, taken intermittently, and a brown pill for your joints. We’ll need to get the names of both of those. It’s important to know what you’re taking, even if it’s just ‘old man things’. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask you about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoke. Bad for you, you know? My father, he said smoke steals your strength. No, never smoke. I drink… sometimes. A little bit of beer, with my friends. But not much. Just on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, occasional alcohol. Now, do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What kind of exam? Will it hurt? I just want to know about my people, Doctor. About the test. Will the test tell me where my family really come from? Will it tell me… who I am? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Laury, the physical exam is routine. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won’t hurt. As for the test… well, as I explained, it’s not a definitive answer. It’s an estimate based on your DNA. It can provide some clues, but it won't tell you "who you are". Your history, your experiences, that is what makes you who you are. However, to ensure you’re healthy enough to potentially proceed with genetic testing – which, again, may not be covered by Medicare – I need to do a basic assessment. Will you allow me to do that?
PATIENT: … Okay. If you think it’s important. But… be gentle, Doctor. I’m an old man. And… promise you’ll still try to find out about my people, even if I’m not… strong enough for the test? Just a little bit of spit… that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. I promise I'll be gentle. And I promise we’ll discuss the genetic testing options further, regardless of the exam results. Now, if you could just follow me over to the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Lead the way. But… maybe you can tell me a little bit about the test while you examine me? It will make me feel better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Laury. While I listen to your heart and lungs, I can explain the process in more detail. Basically, it involves collecting a saliva sample – a bit of spit, as you say – and sending it to a laboratory. They analyze your DNA and compare it to databases of populations around the world. The results will give you an estimated percentage breakdown of your ancestral origins. It’s important to remember that the accuracy of the results can vary, and it’s not a substitute for a thorough genealogical investigation. Now, if you'll just lean back… Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon at your age. I'm detecting a slight murmur, which is also fairly common, but we should monitor it…
PATIENT: Murmur? Is that bad, Doctor? My mother… she had a weak heart too. Is it like hers? And… what if the test says I'm not Marshallese? What if it says I come from… somewhere else? Somewhere far away?
DOCTOR: The murmur is mild, Laury. It doesn't necessarily mean it's the same as your mother’s condition. It simply means there’s a slight extra sound when your heart beats. We’ll need to monitor it over time to see if it changes. As for the test results… well, ancestry is a complex thing. People migrate, cultures blend… It’s entirely possible your ancestors traveled from different regions. Even if the test indicates origins outside of the Marshall Islands, it doesn’t diminish your heritage or your connection to your community. It simply provides a more nuanced understanding of your ancestral history. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Now, let's check your blood pressure… Relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: …Nuanced? What does that mean, Doctor? I just want to know where I come from. Simple. Is my blood pressure high? I forget if I took my white pill today. My niece says I need to write it down… but I forget.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Laury, but not alarmingly so. It’s understandable given your anxiety and the fact you may have missed your medication. “Nuanced” simply means it’s not always black and white. Ancestry isn’t a single, clear-cut origin. It’s a mix of different influences and migrations over time. The test may reveal ancestors from various regions, rather than just one specific place. Now, let's take a look in your ears… Open your mouth for me, please… and say “Ahhh”…
PATIENT: … It’s confusing, Doctor. I just want to know my story. My mother… she told me stories about the islands, about the ocean, about the stars. But she didn’t know… before that. She didn’t know where we came from before the islands. Is my ear okay? I can’t hear very well anymore.
DOCTOR: Your ears have some wax buildup, which is common at your age, and may be contributing to your difficulty hearing. We can address that if you’d like. And I understand your desire to know your story, Laury. It’s a natural and important thing to want. The genetic testing may provide some clues, but it’s important to remember it won’t tell you everything. It's a fragment of a larger puzzle. Now, let's check your throat… Say “Ahhh” again…
PATIENT: … It feels like chasing a shadow, Doctor. Always reaching for something just out of reach. My niece, she says it will give me closure. But what if it doesn’t? What if it just… opens more questions?
DOCTOR: You’re right, Laury. It might open more questions. And it’s perfectly valid to feel anxious about that. Closure isn’t always guaranteed, and sometimes the search for answers can be more challenging than we anticipate. Before we discuss whether or not to proceed with the genetic testing, I want to make sure you’re feeling comfortable and informed. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: … Will you help me understand the results, Doctor? If I do the test… if it says something complicated… will you help me piece it all together? Not just give me numbers and percentages… but tell me what it means? That’s all I ask. Just… help me understand my story.
DOCTOR: Yes, Laury. I will. If you decide to proceed with the testing, I will absolutely help you understand the results. I won't just give you numbers and percentages. I'll take the time to explain what they mean, and we can discuss any potential implications together. We can explore resources for genealogical research, and I can help you connect with relevant cultural organizations. It's important to remember, however, that this is a journey, not a destination. And sometimes, the most valuable discoveries are found not in the answers, but in the questions themselves. Now, let’s talk about the practicalities of the test. It involves a simple saliva sample, which can be collected at the clinic or mailed to a laboratory… Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: … Yes, Doctor. Please. Tell me everything. Maybe… maybe this shadow isn’t so scary after all.
DOCTOR: "First, we'll need to fill out a consent form, outlining the purpose of the test and your rights as a patient. Then, we’ll collect a saliva sample using a kit provided by the laboratory. It’s a simple process, involving spitting into a small tube… The kit is sent to the laboratory, where they analyze your DNA and compare it to their database of populations around the world. The results are typically available within four to six weeks. They'll provide an estimated percentage breakdown of your ancestral origins, broken down by geographic regions. It’s important to remember that these are estimates, based on statistical probabilities. The accuracy of the results can vary depending on the size and diversity of the database. The cost of the test varies depending on the laboratory and the level of detail you require. I can provide you with a list of reputable laboratories and their pricing options. Now, it’s also important to understand the limitations of the test. It won’t tell you everything about your ancestors. It won’t reveal their names, their occupations, or their personal stories. It’s simply a tool for gaining a broader understanding of your genetic origins. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: … So, it’s like… a map, but not a complete map? It shows me where they might have been, but not who they were? And it costs money… how much money, roughly? My niece didn’t say anything about money.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good analogy, Laury. It’s like a map, but not a complete one. It shows you potential regions of origin, but doesn’t reveal the full story of your ancestors. As for the cost, it varies depending on the laboratory and the level of detail you choose. A basic ancestry test, providing a broad overview of your origins, typically costs around $100 to $200. More detailed tests, offering insights into specific ethnic groups or migration patterns, can cost upwards of $300 or $400. I have some brochures here with information about different laboratories and their pricing options. It's important to note that Medicare typically doesn’t cover the cost of ancestry testing unless it's deemed medically necessary. But we can certainly explore other options, such as payment plans or financial assistance programs, if needed. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: … $200… that’s a lot of fish. But… maybe it’s worth it. If it helps me understand my story. I don’t need all the details, just… a starting point. What if I don’t like the results, Doctor? What if it says I’m not Marshallese? What if it says I come from somewhere… scary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Laury. It’s okay to be worried about the possibility of unexpected results. But I want to assure you that whatever the results may be, they won’t change who you are. Your identity is shaped by your experiences, your culture, and your community, not by your genetic origins. If the results do indicate origins outside of the Marshall Islands, it simply means that your ancestors may have migrated from different regions. It doesn't diminish your heritage or your connection to your community. It simply adds another layer to your story. And if the results do suggest origins from a region that you perceive as “scary,” we can explore that together. We can learn about the history and culture of that region, and understand why you might feel that way. I will be here to support you every step of the way, regardless of the results. We can discuss your concerns, explore your options, and help you make sense of whatever you discover. Now, if you’re ready to proceed, we can fill out the consent form and collect a saliva sample. But there’s absolutely no pressure. You can take your time, review the information, and make a decision that feels right for you. Do you have any other questions before we move forward?
PATIENT: … Okay, Doctor. Let’s do it. Let’s find out what’s hiding in the shadows. But promise me you’ll be there to help me understand. Promise you won’t let me face it alone.
DOCTOR: I promise, Laury. I will be here every step of the way. We'll face it together. Now, let's fill out this consent form. It outlines the purpose of the test, your rights as a patient, and how your data will be protected. It's important to read it carefully before signing. Take your time. I’ll be right here if you have any questions. And remember, whatever we discover, it won't change who you are. It will simply add another layer to your story.
