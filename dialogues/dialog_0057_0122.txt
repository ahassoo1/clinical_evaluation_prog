DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My blood pressure has been… difficult. And lately, I have been… forgetting things. Small things, usually. But it worries me. I am Venus Alvara.
DOCTOR: It’s good to meet you too, Venus. “Difficult” blood pressure and some memory concerns… Okay. Let’s start with the blood pressure. How long have you noticed it being difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Perhaps… five years? It goes up and down. My husband, he… he always kept track of it. Now… now I try. But I forget to write it down sometimes, or I write it in the wrong place. It is frustrating. He passed last year, you see. He always managed everything.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband, Venus. That must be incredibly difficult, especially managing things on your own now. It’s completely understandable that things feel a bit more challenging. So, five years of fluctuating blood pressure… Do you happen to know what your readings typically are, even roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… yes. When it is good, maybe… 130 over 80? But other times… it goes much higher. 160, even 180 over… I don’t know, 100? Sometimes higher. I do not remember the second number well. It depends on the day, what I eat, if I am stressed. It is… variable. I take a pill, a white one, but sometimes I forget if I took it this morning. Very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, 130/80 as a lower reading, and occasionally going up to 180/100 or higher… and that’s with a white pill you take sometimes, but you're unsure if you took it today. That’s helpful to know. And just to clarify, you said you're not always certain if you’ve taken the pill?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… correct. Some days I find it on the counter and I think, “Did I take it?” And other days, I simply… do not remember. It is a small pill, easy to overlook. My husband, he had a chart for everything. He would remind me. Now… now I rely on my memory, and it is… failing me, it seems. It is not the large things, you understand. It is keys, or what I ate for breakfast. Small things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so small memory lapses—forgetting keys, what you’ve eaten—along with the fluctuating blood pressure and uncertainty about taking your medication. We need to get a better handle on all of this. First, let’s talk about the pill. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No, I do not. He always filled it. The bottle is… blue, I think. Or perhaps dark green? I am not certain. It is small, white, and I take it with water in the morning. I apologize. I should know these things. It is just… so much has changed in the last year. He handled all the details. I am not good with names, even. Not for people, not for pills.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Venus. As you said, a lot has changed, and it’s completely understandable you’re not focused on every detail right now. We’ll figure it out together. Since you don’t know the medication name, and you’re unsure if you took it this morning, let’s do a quick check of your blood pressure now, and then we’ll talk about some other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Checking the pressure is a good idea. And then… what other things? Will you be asking me many questions? I hope they are not too difficult. I get… flustered easily now.
DOCTOR: Just some questions to get a better understanding of your overall health, Venus. Nothing too difficult, I promise. We'll take it one step at a time. I just want to rule out other possible causes for your memory concerns and get your blood pressure under control. First, let’s get your blood pressure reading. Can you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I will sit. Please, do not hesitate to tell me if I am doing something incorrectly. I am not used to being… examined. My husband always took me to the dentist, and he handled everything. This feels… strange.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly, Venus. Just relax your arm, and try to take slow, deep breaths. You’re not doing anything incorrectly at all. This is just a routine check. …Okay. Your blood pressure is currently 168 over 92. That’s a bit elevated, as you suspected. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Let’s talk about your medical history, Venus. Have you been diagnosed with any other health conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… high. As expected, I suppose. No, no diabetes. And I do not believe I have… cholesterol. My husband always said I ate too much butter. I had a problem with my heart, many years ago. When I was younger. A valve, I think. They fixed it with… with surgery. Many years ago. It has never bothered me since. It was in… 1998, perhaps? I am not certain. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heart valve surgery in 1998. That’s important information. And you haven’t had any problems with it since?
PATIENT: No. None at all. They said it was a complete success. I saw a specialist for many years afterwards, but he said I did not need to come back anymore. That was… ten years ago, perhaps? It all feels like a very long time ago. I lived a normal life, I believe. I travelled with my husband, I gardened, I cooked. I was… happy. Until… now. The memory problems are new. And the blood pressure… it has always been a little high, but it is worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the memory concerns are relatively new, and your blood pressure has been worsening recently. That's helpful to know. Besides the heart valve surgery, have you had any other surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not that I recall. A tonsillectomy when I was a child, a wisdom tooth removed… small things. Nothing serious. I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. But it healed quickly. No other hospital stays. I have always been… healthy, I believe. Until recently. I worry about my mind, you see. My husband, he was a very… intellectual man. I fear I am losing… myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. It’s good that you’ve been generally healthy. We'll work to figure out what’s going on and address both your memory concerns and your blood pressure. Now, let’s talk about medications. Aside from the white pill you mentioned, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the white pill. Sometimes. I used to take something for my joints, when they ached. But I stopped. It did not seem to help much, and my husband said it could interact with the blood pressure medication. He was always very careful about these things. I do take a multivitamin, occasionally. When I remember. It seems my memory is failing me in all aspects of my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the white pill, sometimes, and a multivitamin occasionally. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. I eat everything. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish, but I am not. I have never had a reaction to anything. Even as a child, I did not have allergies. I am very fortunate, in that regard. Unless… dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I dust the furniture. But that is not an allergy, is it? Just… dust.
DOCTOR: Dust is a common irritant, Venus, not necessarily an allergy. That’s not a concern. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I never cared for alcohol. And I have never smoked, not even a cigarette. I find it… distasteful. And recreational drugs… that is… unthinkable. I lead a very… quiet life. I read, I garden, I cook. I used to travel with my husband, but now… now I stay close to home. It is… lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Venus. A quiet life, reading, gardening, cooking… that sounds lovely. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had heart problems, I believe. She died when I was young, from a… a weak heart. My father… he had high blood pressure, like me. He lived to be a very old man, though. He always said the secret was to stay busy. My grandmother… she suffered from memory problems in her old age. The doctor said it was… senility, perhaps? They did not have the same names for things back then. It worries me, you see. The memory problems. It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, and some memory issues. That’s helpful to know, Venus. Now, to finish up with the medical history, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What… what does that mean? I do not understand. Do you mean… do I have friends? I used to… we travelled with my husband. We had acquaintances. But… since he passed… it is mostly just me. I keep to myself. I do not go out much. I have a neighbor who brings me groceries sometimes. Is that what you mean? I am not very… social, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Venus. I apologize for using such formal language. By social history, I just meant things like whether you live alone, your level of activity, and if you have any support systems. You’ve already answered most of that. You live alone, you enjoy reading and gardening, and you have a helpful neighbor. That’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. A physical exam. I hope it will not be… unpleasant. I have never been very good with doctors. My husband always insisted on accompanying me, and he would ask all the questions. Now… now I am on my own. Please, do not hesitate to tell me if I need to do anything special. I am a little nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venus. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we’ll take it slow. It’s just a routine check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, things like that. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is it… alright? I am not breathing correctly, perhaps? My husband always said my breathing was shallow.
DOCTOR: Your breathing is fine, Venus. Perfectly normal. I'm just listening for anything unusual. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s likely related to your previous valve surgery, and doesn’t seem to be concerning at this time, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Oh. A murmur. Is that… bad? My husband always said I should be careful with my heart. I am glad it does not seem to be concerning, but… it worries me nonetheless. Checking the pressure again. Very well. I hope it is not as high as before.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Venus, a murmur can be quite common after valve surgery, and as I said, doesn’t seem concerning at this time. We’ll monitor it. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 158 over 90. It’s still elevated, but slightly lower than before. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling over the edge of the table?
PATIENT: Slightly lower… that is… good, I suppose. Legs dangling… yes, I can do that. Is there anything special I need to do? I am not very good with these things. My husband always said I was clumsy. Please, do not hesitate to tell me if I am doing something incorrectly. I am a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Venus. No need to do anything special. I'm just checking your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’d like to check your pulses. Your pulses are good and strong. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically. However, your elevated blood pressure and your memory concerns are things we need to address. Given your concerns and the family history, I would like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Also, I would like you to keep a log of your blood pressure readings twice a day for the next week. Do you think you could manage that?
PATIENT: Blood work… an EKG… it sounds… complicated. A log of blood pressure readings… twice a day… I suppose I can try. But I am afraid I will forget. My memory… it is not what it used to be. I will try my best, but I make no promises. What… what will the blood work and EKG tell you? Are they… serious tests? I am afraid of bad news.
DOCTOR: They aren’t serious tests in the sense that they’re dangerous, Venus. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check your kidney function, rule out any underlying infections, and check your cholesterol levels. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart and make sure everything is functioning properly. They're routine tests to gather more information. As for the blood pressure log, don’t worry if you forget sometimes. Just do your best to record it when you remember. It's helpful to have a general idea of your blood pressure throughout the day. I can give you a simple chart to use, and we can review it together next week. Based on your concerns and the family history, I would also like to discuss the possibility of a referral to a neurologist to further evaluate your memory concerns. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… serious. Is it… is it something bad? Am I… losing my mind? I do not want to go to a neurologist if it means… bad news. I suppose… I suppose I can think about it. But I am very worried. What… what will they do? What if they tell me something I do not want to hear? I just want to know why I am forgetting things. I just want to be myself again.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’re worried, Venus. Seeing a neurologist doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. A neurologist is simply a specialist who focuses on the brain and nervous system. They can help us determine the cause of your memory concerns and rule out any underlying medical conditions. They may ask you some questions about your medical history and lifestyle, perform a physical exam, and possibly order some imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan. The tests are not painful, and they will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s important to remember that many memory problems are caused by things that are easily treatable, such as stress, depression, or vitamin deficiencies. Seeing a neurologist is simply a way to get more information and make sure we’re addressing all potential causes. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done and keeping track of your blood pressure. We can discuss the neurologist referral again next week, after we have more information. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds acceptable. Blood work first. And keeping track of the pressure. And we can talk about the… neurologist later. I do not want to rush into anything. I need time to… to process everything. Can I have a copy of the instructions for the blood work and the pressure log? I want to read them carefully at home. And… and will you explain everything again next week, if I forget something? I am afraid of making a mistake.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venus. I will print out detailed instructions for both the blood work and the blood pressure log. And of course, I'm happy to explain everything again next week, as many times as you need. Don't worry about making a mistake – that's what I'm here for. The blood work will require a fasting sample, so you'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for 8-12 hours beforehand. I will give you a lab requisition form to take with you. As for the blood pressure log, I will provide you with a simple chart to record your readings twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening. Here are the instructions. Please take your time reading them, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review the results and discuss your concerns further. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Venus?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very kind. And patient. I am still worried, but… I feel a little better knowing that you are here to help. I will try my best to follow the instructions. And I will see you next week. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. I’m glad I could help, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. I’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
