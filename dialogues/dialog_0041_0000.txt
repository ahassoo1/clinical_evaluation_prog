DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my legs, really. They just…gave out on me. Not all at once, it started after a really bad cold a few weeks ago. I haven't been able to do much since. It’s quite inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs giving out after a cold…that’s definitely something we need to look into. Just to clarify, when you say “gave out”, did you mean they felt weak, or did you actually fall?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I didn’t fall fall. Though I nearly did a couple of times. It’s like…they just wouldn't hold my weight. Like jelly, almost. I was trying to walk to get the mail and suddenly I just…couldn’t. Had to sit down right on the steps. It’s not a good look, let me tell you. I had to have my neighbor bring it in. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frightening and frustrating. Okay, “like jelly” is a good way to describe it. And it happened after a cold… about how long after the cold did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The cold itself, it was… probably two and a half weeks ago. Maybe three. It was a nasty one, knocked me flat for a few days. Then, about a week after I started feeling better, that’s when my legs started acting up. It wasn’t immediate. It was gradual, at first. Just a little wobbly. Now, it’s…well, you heard. It's just gotten progressively worse. I'm not one for dramatics, but it's truly bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a week after the cold, gradual onset… that gives us a timeline. Have you noticed it happening with any specific activities, or is it just random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though, walking any distance definitely makes it worse. Even just getting up from a chair can be a struggle now. I used to be quite active, you know? I lead tours – walking tours of the city. Very popular, I might add. But I haven’t been able to do that, obviously. And honestly, I don't understand why. It just doesn’t make sense. I don’t do anything strenuous. I eat well, mostly. It's just… frustrating. A good pair of legs is important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Right, walking tours… that makes it even more concerning. Okay, so it's impacting your ability to work, and it seems to be worse with activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the leg weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, thankfully. No numbness or tingling. No fever, no dizziness. Just…weakness. It’s just my legs. It’s… peculiar. I’ve always been very healthy, really. I rarely get sick, and when I do, it’s usually just a mild sniffle. This is… unsettling. And frankly, I've been reading things online – you know, just trying to understand – and it's all very alarming. Though, I understand the internet isn’t always reliable. Still. It's making me anxious, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and you're right to be cautious about information you find online. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking about… that? Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t come here for a full examination. Why would my legs be connected to… that? No, everything is perfectly normal in that department, thank you very much. I simply came because I can’t walk properly. Is that so difficult to understand? I just want to know what's wrong with my legs. It feels like a waste of my time to discuss personal matters like that.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question why I'm asking, and I apologize if that felt invasive. It’s just that changes in bowel or bladder function can sometimes be related to nerve issues that could affect the legs, so it's a standard question to rule things out. It's not something I’d normally focus on unless other symptoms point that way, and I completely respect your boundaries. Let’s get back to the legs. Have you noticed any stiffness or cramping?
PATIENT: Stiffness, yes, sometimes. Especially in the mornings. It eases up a little after I move around, but it’s there. Cramping, not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I suppose I could have a little ache here and there, but I wouldn’t call it cramping. It's more like… a general fatigue in my legs. Like they're heavy and worn out. Honestly, Doctor, it's just… debilitating. I'm a very independent woman. I don’t like relying on others. This is…humiliating. Is there anything you can do to fix this? I have tours booked for next month. I really need to know if I’ll be able to do them.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and need for answers, Sharifa. It’s definitely concerning to hear about the stiffness and fatigue, and the impact this is having on your independence. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be careful. I don't want to fall in here. It’s not a pretty sight, I assure you. And don't expect a graceful performance. It's quite difficult, you know? Balancing is…challenging at the moment. Honestly, this is rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, just take your time. That’s perfectly alright. I’m here to support you. Now, could you try walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: See? It's like walking on jelly. Absolutely dreadful. I have to concentrate so hard just to keep from falling. It’s exhausting, honestly. And this is only a few steps. Imagine trying to lead a group of tourists for a few hours. It's simply…impossible. Honestly, I’m starting to get rather worried. Is it something serious? Please tell me it’s not something serious. I can’t afford to be laid up for weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. I’m noting the weakness and the tremor you’re experiencing. I don't see any obvious signs of tenderness, which is good. Your reflexes seem a little diminished, but not significantly. I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of inflammation. I also want to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. It may also be helpful to get an electromyography to assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Electromy-what-now? Honestly, Doctor, you’re losing me. All these tests… it sounds rather alarming, doesn’t it? Are you saying it could be something… serious? I really don’t like this. I came here because my legs are weak, not to be subjected to a battery of… procedures. Is there anything simpler we can try first? Perhaps some physical therapy? Or some medication? Honestly, I just want a simple solution. All this talk of nerves and… whatever an EMG is… it’s quite unsettling. And frankly, I'm not keen on having needles stuck into me. It’s bad enough having blood drawn.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa, and I apologize for using medical jargon. An EMG is a test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles. It’s not painful, though it can be slightly uncomfortable. It helps us pinpoint the cause of the weakness. You're right to ask about simpler solutions. We can certainly start with physical therapy to strengthen your legs and improve your balance. I can write you a referral for that. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions first, because we want to make sure we’re not just treating the symptoms. The blood tests are relatively simple, and will give us a lot of information. If those are normal, and the physical therapy doesn’t improve your symptoms, then we can consider the EMG. I want to be thorough and make sure we get to the root of the problem. Would you be comfortable with starting with the blood tests and a referral to physical therapy?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood tests and physical therapy, I suppose. But honestly, Doctor, if it turns out to be something…serious, I want a straight answer. No beating around the bush. I’m a practical woman, and I need to know what I’m dealing with. And if this physical therapy doesn't work, I expect you to be honest about what the next steps will be. No vague promises or…what did you call it… “pinpointing the cause.” I need concrete answers. Is that understood? And please, no more talk of “electromy-whatnots.” I'm already quite stressed as it is.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Straight answers, concrete steps, and no more medical jargon. I understand perfectly. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly along the way. I’ll order the blood tests now, and I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist specializing in neurological conditions. They can assess your strength and balance and develop a personalized treatment plan. We’ll review the blood test results as soon as they come in, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. And if the physical therapy isn’t helping, we’ll talk about the possibility of further investigations. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just…get the tests done, and hopefully, it’s something simple. I really need to get back to work. And honestly, Doctor, I expect a prompt response. I don't want to be waiting weeks for results. I have tours booked, you know. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to sit down. All this standing has quite worn me out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your tests, and I’ll personally review the results as soon as they’re available. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as we have them. Please, sit down and rest. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
