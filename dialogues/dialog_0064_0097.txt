DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Chilla. Marija Chilla. I received a letter suggesting I might want to discuss… arrangements. For the future, should something… happen. My husband thought it prudent. Frankly, I find it a bit morbid, but here I am. I believe it had to do with a form? An advance directive, perhaps? I’m not entirely sure what that entails.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, I believe I have a note about that. It’s thoughtful of your husband. An advance directive – sometimes called a living will – is basically a document where you can outline your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. It can cover things like whether or not you’d want life-sustaining treatment. It is a bit heavy, I understand. But it really is about ensuring your voice is heard, even when you can't express it. Before we get too far into that, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? Well, I am… particular about my diet. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain a very balanced regimen. I exercise… moderately. I haven’t been seriously ill in years, thankfully. Though I do find the winters here rather trying. My husband keeps telling me I need to see someone about my… circulation, but I assure you, it’s perfectly fine. Just a bit… sensitive to the cold. I don't understand why we need to discuss my health when I came here for a form. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Marija. It is standard, and it's not about doubting anything, truly. It’s more about having a complete picture. The advance directive is important, yes, but understanding your current health status helps us ensure it accurately reflects your wishes. Knowing about things like circulation – even if you feel it's just sensitivity – can be helpful in those difficult conversations. Think of it as building a foundation. We want to make sure this document is as comprehensive as possible. To start, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find this rather intrusive. My husband does worry excessively, and I have been to the doctor a few times for…check-ups. He insists. He’s always convinced something is amiss. Let me see… the doctor did mention my cholesterol a few years ago, but it was only slightly elevated. And I suppose I was told I was…pre-hypertensive, but I monitor my blood pressure at home, and it’s usually perfectly acceptable. It fluctuates, naturally. I do lead a stressful life, managing my affairs, you understand. Really, I prefer to focus on the matter at hand. The form. Can we please discuss the advance directive?
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. We can certainly focus on the advance directive. I apologize if I'm being intrusive. It’s just my nature to gather information, it's for the best possible care. Just to clarify, you mentioned slightly elevated cholesterol and pre-hypertension, and you monitor your blood pressure at home. Do you know what your typical blood pressure readings are?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall the precise numbers. My husband handles all those details. He’s very organized, bless him. I know it's within a reasonable range. I would know if something were drastically wrong. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I assure you. I really would prefer to skip this questioning and get straight to the form. I have appointments later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be delayed. Is it a lengthy document? Will I need to sign a great deal of paperwork?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija. And you’re right, we should focus on the advance directive. It's your wishes that matter most. The form itself isn't terribly lengthy, no. It outlines your preferences for things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. It’s more about understanding what’s important to you. Perhaps we can approach it this way. I can explain the different sections, and you can tell me your wishes for each one. We don’t need to delve into extensive medical history if you’re not comfortable. Before we begin, do you have any existing documents regarding your wishes – a power of attorney for healthcare, perhaps?
PATIENT: A power of attorney… My husband mentioned something of the sort. He does have a tendency to… accumulate paperwork. Let me see… Ah, here we are. I believe this is it. He handled everything, naturally. I simply signed where he directed. Honestly, Doctor, I’d rather not pore over all of this. Just… tell me what I need to know about this form. The advance directive. That’s what I came for.
DOCTOR: Very good. This is a healthcare power of attorney, naming your husband as your decision-maker. That’s helpful. Now, the advance directive itself is a little different. It outlines your specific wishes, even if your husband is making decisions. It’s essentially a conversation starter, ensuring your values are known. Let's start with resuscitation. If your heart were to stop, would you want us to attempt CPR, or would you prefer a "do not resuscitate" order?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… dreadful. I suppose… if it were inevitable… then no. I wouldn’t want to be…prolonged. All that…poking and prodding. It sounds utterly undignified. I trust my husband’s judgment, naturally. He’s a very sensible man. But if I have to state it… no, I wouldn't want resuscitation. I’ve lived a full life. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially. Is that what you needed to know? Can we move on? This is rather unpleasant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Marija. "Do not resuscitate," understood. Next, let’s talk about mechanical ventilation. If you were unable to breathe on your own, would you want us to use a machine to help you, or would you prefer to allow natural death to occur?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. No machines. No tubes. I’ve seen what that does to people. It’s… horrifying. A natural death, please. Let it happen. I wouldn't want to be a burden. And I certainly wouldn't want to be hooked up to all sorts of… contraptions. It sounds… barbaric. Is that what you need to know? Can we please expedite this process? I have a luncheon appointment, you see. With the ladies. And I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija. "No mechanical ventilation," understood. The final section concerns artificial nutrition and hydration – things like feeding tubes. If you were unable to eat or drink, would you want us to provide nutrition and hydration artificially, or would you prefer to allow natural death to occur?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we go through every single detail? It all sounds rather…grim. But if I must… no. No tubes. No artificial anything. Let nature take its course. I’ve lived a good life. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially just for the sake of it. It’s… undignified. Are we finished now? Is there anything else? I truly must be going. I have a luncheon appointment, and I wouldn’t want to be late. The ladies are expecting me. And I believe that concludes my wishes, does it not? No machines, no tubes, let nature take its course. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is perfectly sufficient. We have documented your wishes clearly: no resuscitation, no mechanical ventilation, and no artificial nutrition or hydration. We will ensure this document is readily available should the need arise. I will have my assistant make a copy for your records, and a copy for your husband. And yes, we are finished. Thank you for taking the time to discuss this, despite your reservations. It's a difficult conversation, but a very important one. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your… patience. And please, tell your assistant to be prompt. I really mustn’t be delayed. Good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. And we will certainly ensure your copy is prepared promptly. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon. .
