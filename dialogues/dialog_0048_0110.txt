DOCTOR: Right. Ms. McNabb, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Nicoletta McNabb. Though most folks just call me Nicoletta. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Sink. Look, I have quite a few patients today, so if we could just get straight to the point, that would be… helpful. What brings you in today, Nicoletta?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Well, I suppose… I’m feeling a bit old, if I’m honest. Not sick, exactly. Just… worn down. I want to feel more like myself again, you know? A bit of a reset, or a jumpstart, perhaps. I used to have so much energy, teaching all those little ones. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: “Feeling old” isn’t a diagnosis, Nicoletta. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You're right, of course. Specific… Hmm. Well, I get tired very easily. Even just walking to the mailbox. And my bones… they ache sometimes, especially when the weather changes. And I don’t sleep as well as I used to. I wake up a lot during the night. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, bone aches, insomnia. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been gradually getting worse, I suppose. But I’d say… maybe the last six months or so it’s really become noticeable. Before that, it was just little things, easily dismissed. You know, “old age” things. But now it’s starting to interfere with my daily life. I used to enjoy gardening, but I can’t do much of that anymore.
DOCTOR: And are you taking anything for this?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, if I really can’t sleep, I’ll take a half of one of those… what do you call them… sleep aids? The over-the-counter kind. Not regularly, though. Maybe once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure medication… and occasional over-the-counter sleep aids. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, I did get a bit of a rash once from a mango, but I don’t think that counts. It was probably just the mango!
DOCTOR: Right. No known drug allergies. Let’s move on. Do you have any family history of… anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother lived to be 92, very healthy for most of her life. She did have some trouble with her hips towards the end, needed a replacement, I believe. And my father… he passed away when I was quite young, a heart attack. And my brother, he had… well, he had something with his sugar, diabetes, I think? It runs in the family, perhaps. I don’t remember the details very well, it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart disease and diabetes in the family. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, bless his soul, he tried it once or twice when he was younger, but I put a stop to that right away. Very bad for you, you know. And I barely drink, maybe a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit of a difficult one, Doctor. I used to be very active, walking everywhere, gardening, playing with my grandchildren. But like I said, I’ve been getting tired so easily. Now, I mostly just… sit. I try to get up and move around a little bit, but it doesn’t last long. Maybe a short walk around the house, but that’s about it. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited activity due to fatigue. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me… There we go. A little slow, but I can manage. Please, don’t mind me, Doctor. I used to be much more nimble!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. Pulse is regular at 72. Joints feel mildly tender to palpation, especially the knees. Lung sounds are clear. Okay. Everything seems relatively normal, though your blood pressure is a little high.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? My blood pressure? I do try to watch my salt intake, but… well, I do enjoy a good island dish now and then. Is it something I should be very worried about? I always try to keep up with my checkups, so I'm hoping it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: It’s… elevated. We’ll need to monitor it. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out anything obvious. And perhaps an X-ray of your knees to get a better look at the joints. We'll see what those results say. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your activity level gradually, if possible. And continue to watch your diet and salt intake.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood work and X-rays. Very good. I trust your judgment completely. And I will certainly try to be more active, if I can. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to get started. Will the blood work require a fast? I always forget these things!
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. The lab will give you specific instructions when they call to schedule the appointment. And I’m also going to prescribe you a slightly stronger medication for your blood pressure. We’ll reassess in a month. If there's no improvement, we may need to consider a referral to a specialist. Here are your orders. And try not to worry too much. It's likely just age-related changes. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, 12 hours. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. A specialist… well, let’s hope it doesn't come to that. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor Sink. Thank you for listening to me. It’s nice to finally feel like someone is taking my concerns seriously. I think that's all for now. .
