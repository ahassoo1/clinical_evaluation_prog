DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, it's my pee. It's... orange. I don't know why. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That's certainly something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Like, how orange? Is it dark orange, light orange? It’s… pretty noticeable, you know? Not just a little bit. And it doesn’t hurt when I pee, if that matters. Just… the color is weird.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s a fairly significant orange color, not just a slight tint. And no pain or burning with urination, which is good. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me about how much fluid you’ve been drinking lately?
PATIENT: Not much, maybe. I work outside, it's hot. I drink water when I remember, but… not as much as I should, I guess. Maybe six glasses a day? Sometimes less. I drink coffee too, in the mornings. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, six glasses a day, sometimes less, and coffee in the morning. Yes, caffeine can have a diuretic effect, meaning it can make you lose more fluids. Have you noticed any other changes, like in how often you're urinating, or if you feel particularly thirsty?
PATIENT: I pee about the same, I think. Not more, not less. And I’m not really thirsty, no. Just… worried about the color. My wife said I should come see someone. She got scared.
DOCTOR: That’s good you came in, and it's smart of your wife to encourage that. It’s always best to check these things out. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes or problems with your liver or kidneys?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m usually pretty healthy. I work hard, but… no big problems. I had the flu last winter, but that’s it. No special medicines, nothing. Just… work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No pre-existing medical conditions. And you mentioned no medications currently?
PATIENT: No medicines. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. Like ibuprofen, maybe? But not often. Very rarely. Just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. That's helpful. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, the flu a while back, but nothing since. I haven’t been sick. I eat okay, I think. Sometimes my wife makes me eat more vegetables. She worries about that too. Is that important? What could make my pee orange?
DOCTOR: It’s good you have a wife who looks out for you! Okay, so no recent illnesses. As for what could cause orange urine, there are a few possibilities. Dehydration is a common one, and we’ve established you may not be drinking enough fluids. Certain foods, like beets or carrots, can sometimes cause it. Also, some medications or supplements can change urine color, though you've said you don't take any regularly. Rarely, it can be a sign of a liver or kidney problem, but given your history, that's less likely at this point. To be safe, I’d like to do a quick urine test here in the office. It will help us rule out some of the more concerning possibilities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A test is fine. I just want to know what's wrong. It's… worrying me, you know? I don’t want anything serious. Okay, what do I need to do? Do I just… pee in a cup?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You’ll just need to provide a urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions. There's a restroom just down the hall. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. This helps give us a cleaner sample. I’ll let you have some privacy, and I’ll be right here to analyze the sample when you’re done. Don't worry, we'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Okay. Mid-stream. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
