DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellowish, after I ate some fava beans. It started a couple of weeks ago, and it keeps happening whenever I have them. It’s making me quite worried.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. My mother used to make a lovely stew with them, and I had some last week…and then again a few days ago, because I forgot how it made me feel. It’s silly, really. I just…forgot. It’s not just a little tiredness either, it feels like all my energy is gone, and my skin… well, it's definitely yellow. It’s hard to explain. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a… relative term, Ms. Haggar. And forgetting things is hardly a medical anomaly. Now, this yellowing… where exactly are you noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, I think. Mostly my skin, but also the whites of my eyes… my husband pointed it out. He got quite a fright, bless him. It’s not just a little pale yellow, it’s…noticeable. It’s just… unsettling to look at myself. I haven’t been feeling well enough to really do much, to be honest. Mostly just resting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you’ve only experienced this after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Every time I eat them, within a day or so, I start to feel weak and then the yellowing begins. It doesn’t happen with anything else, just fava beans. I haven’t changed anything else in my diet, and I haven’t been sick with anything else recently. It’s…very specific, which is why it feels so odd. Is it something bad? I worry a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, I must say your case is… unusual. This sounds suspiciously like a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency—an enzyme, I believe—that causes a reaction to fava beans. Now, let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll need some blood work to confirm this, of course. Have you ever had any issues with anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I was anemic, no. I get tired easily sometimes, but I always thought that was just…me. I work a desk job, and I’m not very active, so I figured it was normal. Would that show up in a blood test? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. What does anemia even mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Anemia means you have a low red blood cell count. Red blood cells carry oxygen. Low oxygen… well, that explains the tiredness. And yes, it can be quite serious, depending on the cause. We will, naturally, determine the cause. I'll order a complete blood count and a G6PD enzyme assay to see if this confirms our suspicion of Favism. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. No penicillin, no pain relievers…nothing. My mother always said I had a strong stomach, although perhaps that’s why I kept eating the fava beans! I’m so sorry, Doctor, for being so… rambling. I just get anxious when I don’t understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen… slightly tender, but nothing alarming. Your sclera – the whites of your eyes – are indeed jaundiced, as you mentioned. We will await the lab results. In the meantime, absolutely no fava beans. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely no fava beans! I understand perfectly. It’s a bit sad, honestly. But my health is more important. When do you think the results will be back? And… what happens if it is Favism? Will I be sick forever? I know I’m asking a lot of questions, but… it’s frightening to think about.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 24-48 hours. If it is indeed Favism, it means you have a genetic predisposition to a reaction to fava beans. It's not a death sentence, Ms. Haggar, but it requires strict avoidance of certain foods and medications that can trigger a reaction. It's a lifelong condition, yes, but manageable. Now, I have other patients waiting. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you with a plan. Do you have any further questions for now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s a bit scary. I’ll just…try not to worry too much until I hear back. And I promise, no more fava beans! Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may go now. And Ms. Haggar, try to remain calm. .
