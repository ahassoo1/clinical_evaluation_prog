DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Raymonde. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… things haven't been right, I guess. I’ve been feeling awful sick to my stomach a lot, and… I don't know… just not hungry. Even a little bit of food fills me up too fast, and it doesn’t feel good. It's been going on for a bit now, and my daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come see someone. I forget how long exactly… a few weeks, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Raymonde. A few weeks, alright. We'll try to get a clearer picture of that. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Feeling sick to your stomach and a lack of appetite can be caused by many things, and it's best to investigate. Could you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a quick throwing-up kind of sick. It’s more… a queasy feeling, all the time, or coming and going. It’s worse in the mornings, I think. And it doesn’t always make me sick, just… feels like it might. It’s hard to explain. Like… a rocking boat, maybe? Does that make sense? And… I don’t know if this is important, but sometimes I burp a lot, and it doesn’t help the queasy feeling. It just… bubbles up.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Raymonde – the “rocking boat” description is very helpful. And the burping is definitely relevant. It sounds like it’s causing you quite a bit of discomfort. Now, besides the nausea and burping, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Well, I’ve been tired. More tired than usual, I mean. I always liked my garden, but I haven’t had the energy for it lately. And… sometimes my stomach feels… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. Like a balloon, almost. And… oh dear. This is hard to remember. I think… maybe I’ve lost a little weight? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t weighed myself. Honestly, I haven't been feeling up to much of anything, so I haven't really noticed things like that. Is that helpful? I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Raymonde. You’re providing very valuable information. Fatigue, a feeling of fullness, and potential weight loss are all important things to note. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a constellation of symptoms. Let's try to establish a timeline a bit better. When you say "a few weeks", can you recall anything specific that might have coincided with the start of these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Everything feels a bit… jumbled. I think… maybe around the time of my grandson’s birthday? He turned ten, I believe. That was… July, wasn't it? I baked him a cake, though I didn’t eat much of it myself. I just didn't have much appetite even then. But… that might not be when it started, exactly. I just remember not feeling great at his birthday. Before that… I honestly can’t say. I spend a lot of time with my animals, and… things just sort of blend together. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. It's common for things to become less distinct with time, especially when you're not feeling well. July is a good starting point. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, a long time ago. And… oh, dear. This is difficult. I was diagnosed with… something… a few years back. Cancer, I think. But it was… early stage, they said. They did some treatments, and then… well, they said it was okay, mostly. I've been having regular check-ups since then, with Dr. Henderson. But he… retired, didn't he? Yes, he retired. And I haven't seen a doctor regularly since then, until now. I forget what kind of cancer it was, exactly. Something with the stomach, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I try not to dwell on it. It’s all a bit of a blur. Does that help? I feel terrible for not remembering more.
DOCTOR: It does help, Raymonde, and please don't feel terrible about not remembering. It’s understandable to try and not dwell on difficult experiences. Having had cancer, even early stage, is very important information. And the fact that you were being followed up is good to know. I can access your records from Dr. Henderson's office. That will help us clarify the type of cancer and the treatment you received. While I'm doing that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are acting up. But not every day. Just when they hurt. And… oh! I take vitamins. A multivitamin, and something for my eyes. I get them from the drugstore. I can't remember the names of them, I'm afraid. They're all in a little pill organizer, in the kitchen. I’m not very good at keeping track of things anymore. My daughter helps me with it, mostly. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Raymonde. That's helpful. Multiple medications, even over-the-counter ones, are important to note. We'll get a complete list from your pharmacy records as well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any problems with anything, not in a long time. I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in years. And… no, I don't think I have any food allergies. I eat pretty much anything, although my appetite hasn't been very good lately, as you know. My daughter always asks me if I’m allergic to anything when she takes me to the doctor, and I always tell her no.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Raymonde. No known allergies are helpful. Okay, Raymonde, I’ve reviewed your records. It looks like you had early-stage stomach cancer five years ago, which was successfully treated. That’s very encouraging. Given your history and current symptoms – nausea, lack of appetite, fullness, fatigue – I'd like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better. It’s been… unsettling, not feeling like myself. And my daughter worries so much. So, yes, please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Raymonde. Alright. If you could sit back and relax, I'll start with listening to your abdomen, and then I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Afterwards, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. This won't take long. Bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Alright, Raymonde. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I did notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, right here. Is that where you’ve been feeling most of the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly where it hurts. Right there, in the middle. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, most of the time. Sometimes it feels like a fullness, like I’ve eaten too much, even when I haven’t. And… sometimes it radiates to my back, a little bit. Not a bad pain, but… noticeable. It's good you found that, I guess. It’s been hard to explain it to anyone.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Raymonde. That's helpful. Given your history of stomach cancer, the tenderness in your epigastric region, and your symptoms, I'd like to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll start with a complete blood count to check for anemia and inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a stool test to rule out any infection. I also want to order an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It will allow us to directly examine the lining of your stomach and take biopsies if necessary. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. An endoscopy… is that… uncomfortable? I don't remember having one before. I just… I’m not very good with things like that. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… I wish we could figure this out without so many tests. But… yes, Doctor, if you think it’s best, then please, do what you need to do. I just want to feel better. And… will those tests tell us if the cancer has come back?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious about the tests, Raymonde. And you’re right, it is a lot, but given your history, it’s important to be thorough. The endoscopy does involve inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It's typically well-tolerated, and we'll provide sedation to help you relax and minimize discomfort. Most people don’t remember much of the procedure. There is a small risk of complications, but it's very rare. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits in more detail before the procedure. The main purpose of the endoscopy is to rule out any recurrence of the cancer or to identify any other potential causes of your symptoms, such as ulcers or inflammation. We’ll take biopsies during the procedure if we see anything concerning, and the results will help us determine the best course of action. I want to assure you that we'll take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. We'll also discuss the results of the tests with you in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan if necessary. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. I think… I think I understand. Sedation… that sounds good. I don’t think I could do it without that. And… you’ll tell me everything, no matter what? Even if it’s… bad news? My daughter worries so much, and I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily until we know something for sure. I guess… I guess I’m mostly worried about the cancer coming back. It was such a scary time, and I just… I don’t want to go through that again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. And yes, absolutely. We will tell you everything, no matter what the results are. We believe in open and honest communication, and we want you to be fully informed every step of the way. We'll discuss the results in detail, answer all your questions, and work with you and your daughter to develop a plan that's best for you. It’s completely understandable to be worried about the cancer coming back. It was a traumatic experience, and it's natural to feel anxious. But remember, we're here to support you, and we'll do everything we can to help you get through this. We'll proceed with the tests, and once we have the results, we'll have a much clearer picture of what's going on. For now, I’m going to write the orders for the blood work, stool test, and the upper endoscopy. The nurse will schedule the endoscopy for you. I also want to prescribe a medication to help with the nausea. It’s called Promethazine. It should provide some relief while we’re waiting for the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. Promethazine… that sounds… helpful. Anything to ease the sickness. Thank you. And… thank you for being so patient with me. I’m not very good at remembering things, and I ask a lot of questions, I know. I guess… I’ll go home now and try to relax. But I don’t think I’ll be sleeping much tonight. I’ll try not to worry too much, though. And… I’ll let my daughter know you’ve ordered some tests. She’ll be happy to hear that you’re taking care of me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. Please don’t apologize for asking questions – it’s important to be informed and feel comfortable. And don’t worry about remembering things – that’s perfectly alright. We’re here to help in any way we can. I'll have the nurse give you written instructions about the tests and the medication. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We'll get to the bottom of this, Raymonde. And we'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and please try to rest. I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
