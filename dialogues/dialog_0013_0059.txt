DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome to the clinic. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Chriselda. It’s…nice to meet you. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure. My husband, he brought me in. He says my speech hasn’t been quite right lately. I…I feel like I’m mumbling sometimes, or not saying things clearly. It's a bit frustrating, really. I don’t recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good your husband noticed and brought you in – sometimes it’s hard to self-detect these things. And it’s very common to not pinpoint an exact start date. So, you're saying he's noticed some difficulty with your clarity of speech – mumbling, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Mumbling…yes. And sometimes, I feel like the words are just…slurred. Not always, but enough for him to be concerned. I haven’t noticed it myself, to be perfectly honest. He said it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, maybe? I truly don’t remember. Everything feels a bit…fuzzy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Adyn. Fuzzy is a good way to put it. Okay, so a couple of weeks, possibly. And it’s not constant, but intermittent slurring and mumbling. Have you noticed any difficulty understanding things when people speak to you?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so. No, I haven’t had trouble understanding folks. It’s more…what I’m saying, not what I’m hearing. Though, now that you mention it, my husband has repeated himself a few times. But that could be anything, right? He does that sometimes anyway. I’m not sure if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Right, it could very well be unrelated. Okay, so clarity of speech is the main concern, no trouble understanding others, and your husband has noticed some repetition on his end, though that may not be connected. Let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes…let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I work on construction sites, so being tired is…normal, you know? It's hard to say what's normal and what isn’t. I haven’t really noticed anything else… significant. No headaches, no dizziness, no weakness…nothing like that. Just the speech and the fatigue.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue alongside the speech changes. And you rightly point out that fatigue is common with your work. Let's explore that a bit. Is this fatigue constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s worse in the afternoons, usually. In the mornings, I feel alright. Relatively alright, anyway. But by the time I finish work…that’s when I’m really dragging. And it’s not just physical, either. It’s…mental fatigue, too. Hard to concentrate, you know? I find myself forgetting things more easily. Which is…unhelpful on a construction site.
DOCTOR: Right, mental fatigue as well as physical. That's helpful to know. Okay, Adyn, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check some basic things. It's nothing to worry about, just routine. We'll check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and do a quick speech assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Chriselda. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, Adyn, I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your arms…Good. And now your legs…Perfect. Everything seems symmetrical and within normal limits so far. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I didn’t want to squeeze too hard. I’m not very good at gauging strength, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Adyn. Very good strength in both hands. Now, I'm going to ask you to say a simple sentence – “The sky is blue.” Just speak normally, as you would in a conversation.
PATIENT: The sky is…blue. Does that sound alright? I’m trying to be careful, but it’s hard not to think about it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear that. It's understandable that you're self-conscious. I do notice a slight slurring on the 's' sounds and some difficulty with the 'b' sound, but it’s subtle. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat after me: “No ifs, ands, or buts.”
PATIENT: No…ifs, ands, or…buts. I hope that wasn’t too bad. It's definitely harder than it sounds!
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, thank you. I appreciate your cooperation. I do notice some mild difficulty with articulation, particularly with sounds requiring precise tongue movement. It’s subtle, but consistent. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that alright? I haven’t had any falls or anything, but I don’t always feel as steady on my feet as I used to. It could be the tiredness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes for about 30 seconds. Just try to maintain your balance as best as you can. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Okay. Thirty seconds…okay. I think I'm still standing.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Adyn. You did sway a bit, but you maintained your balance. Alright, based on this quick exam and what you’ve told me, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause right away. The subtle slurring, difficulty with articulation, fatigue, and mild balance issues suggest a few possibilities. One thing we should rule out is vitamin deficiencies, particularly B12. Also, considering your fatigue and subtle neurological symptoms, a thyroid panel would be a good idea. It's also possible, though less likely, that this could be an early sign of a neurological issue, but we need more information.
PATIENT: That…sounds like a lot. Vitamin deficiencies and…thyroid issues? And neurological issues? I…I haven’t noticed anything particularly worrying, aside from the speech. Is this serious? I have a job, you know? I can’t afford to be unwell. Should I be seeing a specialist?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It sounds like a lot, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. These are common things we rule out when we see symptoms like yours. Vitamin deficiencies and thyroid issues are very treatable. And it's better to identify them early. As for the neurological issue, I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s always best to be thorough. To start, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We can review the results together once they come back. As a precaution, I also think it would be wise to get a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation, just to be safe. They can perform further testing if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that…sounds sensible. If it helps rule things out, then I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Blood tests and a specialist…okay. Will the specialist involve…scans or anything like that? I'm a little claustrophobic, you see. And how long will it take to get the results back? I have work, as you know, and I need to be able to plan accordingly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan. As for the specialist, it's difficult to say definitively whether they'll order scans. It depends on what they find during their evaluation. However, if they do recommend a scan, we can definitely discuss your claustrophobia beforehand and explore options like open MRIs or medication to help you manage your anxiety. We’ll work with you to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. The blood test results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for the neurologist appointment, it typically takes a week or two to get in. I’ll give you their contact information, and you can schedule it directly. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that…that’s very reassuring, thank you. Open MRI…that sounds much better. And 3-5 days for the blood tests…okay, I can manage that. You've been very helpful, Chriselda. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So, just to be clear, I need to schedule an appointment with a neurologist, and I’ll hear back from you about the blood test results in about a week?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You need to schedule an appointment with a neurologist, and I’ll call you with your blood test results in 3-5 business days. I’m also going to write you a referral for the neurologist, just in case. Here’s the referral, with their contact information and address. And here's a summary of our conversation today and the tests we’ve ordered. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Chriselda. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll go ahead and schedule that neurologist appointment as soon as I get home. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too, Adyn. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and I hope to speak to you again soon.
