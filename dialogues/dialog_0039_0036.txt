DOCTOR: Hello, Kiwane. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the insurance. I have Medicare, and they require this before… everything is approved, I believe. A physical. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. A Medicare annual wellness exam. Perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re staying on top of things. It is a bit of a process sometimes. So, even though it's for insurance, I still want to make sure we cover all the bases. Let’s start with a little bit about what’s been going on with you generally. Have you been feeling well lately?
PATIENT: Generally… yes. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is… normal. Nothing broken, nothing hurting. I do not… complain much. Is there a form I should be filling out instead? This talking… takes time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can feel like a lot of talking. And you're right, there is a form, but it's mostly things we'll cover anyway. It's good you're generally well! That’s excellent. But just to be thorough, and to make sure nothing is being overlooked… even small things are important. Let's just go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Not… significant. Perhaps one kilogram. Maybe less. I do not weigh myself every day. It is not important to me, as long as my clothes still fit. Is this… necessary? I thought this was just a quick look to say I had it done for the insurance people.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. It should be a fairly straightforward exam for insurance purposes. And I don't want to waste your time. However, even small changes can sometimes indicate something we should be aware of. A kilogram is a relatively small change, and if your clothes still fit, that's reassuring. Let’s put that aside for now. How about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy… is fine. I work long hours. Sometimes I am tired, yes. But that is… normal for work. I do not feel weak or… unwell. Just… tired. Like anyone after a long day. I do not drink coffee, if that is what you are asking. It does not agree with me.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the coffee. No, I wasn’t specifically asking, just checking. And you’re right, tiredness after long hours is normal. It's good you're able to distinguish that from feeling unwell. Okay. Let’s move on to something else. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… perhaps in winter, when it is cold. But that is… the weather. Night sweats… sometimes. But I sleep with many blankets. It is a habit. I like to be warm. Is this… concerning? It sounds like you are asking about illnesses. I do not feel ill.
DOCTOR: No, not at all concerning. I'm just trying to be thorough. Sweating with blankets is perfectly understandable, especially if you like to be warm! I apologize if it feels like I’m asking about illnesses when you’re feeling well. It’s just standard practice. Alright. Let’s see… Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Now you are asking… personal questions. I do not discuss… these things with people I have just met. Is this required for the insurance? Because if it is, I will answer. But it feels… improper. I eat normal food. Everything… functions as it should. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, and I sincerely apologize. That was inappropriate of me to ask so directly without explaining why. It’s part of a full medical history, but completely unnecessary for a basic insurance physical. We can absolutely skip those questions. Let me rephrase. Is there anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems small or unrelated?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I told you. I work, I eat, I sleep. I do not have… problems. Perhaps you should have asked about my work. It is… physical. Lifting heavy things. Long hours on my feet. That is something that could be… relevant. Is that what you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for bringing that up. Physical work, lifting heavy things, long hours on your feet – that's very important information. So, you do that regularly?
PATIENT: Yes. Every day. Six days a week. It is… a factory. Processing food. Not… glamorous work. But it is… work. I lift boxes, I operate machines. I stand for ten hours. Sometimes my back… aches a little. But I rest when I can. I take some… pills for it. Over-the-counter. Nothing strong. Just… to help with the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. What kind of pills are you taking for the back pain?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen. Sometimes naproxen. When it is… very bad. I buy them at the… pharmacy. Like you buy aspirin. Not a prescription. I do not go to the doctor for back pain. It is… normal for my job. Everyone takes them. It is… expected. I do not want to waste your time with… worker’s problems. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly sufficient. And thank you for being so open. Ibuprofen and naproxen, as needed. That’s good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t be extensive, given this is primarily for insurance, but I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a quick look at your back, if you don't mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. As long as it is quick. I have things to do after this. I do not like being… poked and prodded. But if it is required… then do it. Blood pressure, pulse… I do not understand these things. Just tell me when it is finished.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. That’s within a normal range. Now, if you could just stand up and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, could you bend forward and touch your toes, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: There. Finished. It hurts a little. My back… it is not young anymore. I told you I lift heavy things. Is that enough poking and prodding? Can we be done now? I have… responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's enough. I appreciate your patience. I do feel some muscle tension in your lower back, which is consistent with the physical demands of your job. It doesn't seem to be anything serious at this time, but it's something we should be mindful of. Okay, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I have lived a long life without… problems. Dust bothers me sometimes, in the factory. But that is… normal. Everyone coughs. It is not an allergy. Just… dust. It is… unpleasant. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking. No known allergies, just some dust irritation at work. Good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the ibuprofen and naproxen?
PATIENT: No. Only the pills for the back. I do not like taking… many pills. It makes me feel… weak. I try to avoid the doctor as much as possible. It is… a waste of time. I prefer to rest when I need to. And take the ibuprofen. That is all. Can we be finished now? I really must go.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finished. That was all I needed. Thank you for coming in today, and for being so honest. So, to summarise: You're a 28-year-old male working in a food processing factory, lifting heavy objects and on your feet for long hours. You take ibuprofen and naproxen as needed for back pain, have no known allergies, and are generally in good health. I'll submit this information to Medicare for your wellness exam. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. You have everything. I am grateful you did not… poke and prod too much. And that it was quick. Now, if you will excuse me… I have a life to get back to. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiwane. I understand. And you take care of that back! If the pain gets worse, or you develop any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to come back and see me. Have a good day, and be safe. .
