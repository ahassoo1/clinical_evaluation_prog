DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain exactly. I just haven't been feeling right, you know? Mostly it's my stomach. I get sick to my tummy a lot, and I don’t… I don’t eat much before I feel full. It’s been going on for a bit now. I don't rightly recall when it started, though. Everything feels a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: "Sick to your tummy," you say. And you’re feeling full quickly. Do you mean you experience nausea, perhaps even vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes I do throw up. Not always, but when the sickness comes on strong, it happens. It's not…pleasant, of course. And the fullness…it’s like, just a few bites of food and I feel like I’ve eaten a whole feast. It’s just…not normal, is it? I used to be able to eat a good plate of food, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t normal to feel full after only a few bites. And experiencing nausea and vomiting alongside that is concerning. Has this impacted your weight at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I’ve lost weight, I think. My clothes feel…looser. I don't weigh myself regularly, but my daughter, bless her heart, she mentioned it when she visited. Said I was looking…thin. It’s hard to keep track of these things, you know? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. Weight loss is definitely something we need to investigate further. And you mentioned your memory isn't what it used to be... Is this a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been gradual, I think. Years, really. Little things at first – forgetting where I put my glasses, you know. Now… well, now it’s harder to remember things from just yesterday sometimes. It's frustrating, but I manage. My daughter says it’s just old age, but… I don’t know. It's all a bit of a muddle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll address both of these concerns. Let’s start with your stomach. Besides the fullness and nausea, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… discomfort. A queasy feeling, mostly. Sort of a dull ache, high up in my belly, sometimes. It comes and goes, you know? It’s not constant. And it's not so bad that I can't do things, but it's… unsettling. It makes me not want to eat, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A queasy feeling and a dull ache high up in your belly. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this—things like heartburn, bloating, changes in your bowel movements, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think. Heartburn… not really. Bloating, maybe a little, sometimes after I do manage to eat something. And my… well, my bowel movements haven't been regular, no. More… stopped up, if you understand. And no, I haven’t seen any blood. No, thank goodness. That would be frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Ms. Kelder, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her the same thing. I eat pretty much everything. Used to, anyway. Not so much lately. It's just…hard to enjoy food when you feel so sick.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a quick abdominal exam, if that’s alright with you. Just so I can get a better sense of what’s going on. We’ll listen to your stomach and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren't as strong as they used to be, you know. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Sounds are present in all quadrants, but slightly diminished. No bruits auscultated. Mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses detected. Okay, Ms. Kelder. The exam revealed some mild tenderness in the upper part of your abdomen. It doesn’t seem to be anything acute, but it’s worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That doesn't sound too good, does it? But if it's not acute, like you say… that’s a relief, I suppose. What does that mean, though? Investigating further… does that mean tests? I don't like tests, Doctor. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: It means we'll need to do a few tests to help us figure out what's causing your symptoms. I understand you're nervous, Ms. Kelder, and I’ll explain everything as we go. We’ll start with a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. We'll also do a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to rule out any bacterial infections. Finally, I'd like to order an upper endoscopy to take a closer look at your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. The endoscopy will require some preparation, but it's the most effective way to diagnose your condition. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's… a lot. An endoscopy? That sounds…serious. And preparation? What kind of preparation? And what will they do during the endoscopy? I’m getting quite worried now, Doctor. I… I don’t know about all this. I’m not sure I understand all of it, and frankly, it’s a bit frightening. Is there… is there any way we could just try something else first? Maybe some medicine?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious about these tests, especially an endoscopy. The preparation involves a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure and taking a laxative to empty your bowels. During the endoscopy, a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end is gently inserted through your mouth into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It allows us to visualize the lining of these organs and take biopsies if necessary. While medication can help manage some of your symptoms, it won't address the underlying cause. We need to determine why you’re experiencing these issues before we can effectively treat them. However, I can start you on a proton pump inhibitor – a medication to reduce stomach acid – while we await the endoscopy. It may alleviate some of your discomfort. It's important to remember that this is a common procedure, and we take every precaution to ensure your safety and comfort. Do you have any concerns about the endoscopy specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, a proton pump inhibitor… that sounds a little better than all those other tests. Reducing the acid… that makes sense, I suppose. I’m still worried about the endoscopy, though. Going down your throat like that… it sounds… uncomfortable. And what if they find something bad? Will it hurt? And what if it’s…cancer? My husband… he had cancer. It wasn’t a good experience. I’m getting so upset now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel upset, Ms. Kelder. Your feelings are perfectly valid. I understand your anxiety, especially given your husband’s experience. Let’s address your concerns one by one. The endoscopy will be performed under sedation, so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. We'll monitor your vital signs closely throughout the process. As for finding something concerning, it's true that it's a possibility. However, we won't know until we perform the endoscopy. If we do find anything abnormal, we'll discuss the results with you in detail and develop a treatment plan together. It's important to remember that early detection is key with many conditions, and the sooner we identify the problem, the better our chances of successful treatment. I want you to know that I will be with you every step of the way. We have a team of skilled professionals who will ensure your comfort and safety. We will take the time to answer all of your questions and address your concerns. Would you like me to explain the endoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… kind of you to say, Doctor. Knowing I won't feel anything during it does make me feel a little better. And knowing you’ll be there… that helps too. Yes, please. If you could explain it again, just… slowly. And tell me what happens afterward. What will I be able to eat? Will my throat hurt? I just… I'm scared. It’s silly, I know, but I can’t help it.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly natural to be scared. As I said, you’ll receive sedation through an IV – usually a mild sedative to help you relax. You’ll be monitored closely by a nurse and myself throughout the entire procedure. You’ll be lying on your left side, and we’ll gently insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your mouth and into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The tube doesn't block your airway, and you'll be able to breathe normally. The entire procedure usually takes about 15-30 minutes. During this time, we'll carefully examine the lining of these organs for any abnormalities – inflammation, ulcers, or growths. We may take small biopsies – tiny tissue samples – for further examination under a microscope. These biopsies are generally painless. After the procedure, you’ll be monitored in a recovery area until the sedation wears off. You may experience some mild bloating or a sore throat – which is normal and should resolve within a day or two. You'll start with clear liquids and gradually advance to a normal diet as tolerated. We'll give you specific instructions on what to eat and drink. You may also experience some gas, but that can be alleviated with over-the-counter medications. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the biopsies and develop a treatment plan if necessary. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Not pleasant, but manageable. A sore throat… I can handle a sore throat. And clear liquids… that's not so bad. What about driving home? Can I drive home after the sedation? My daughter usually takes me to these appointments, but she has a work thing that day. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Kelder. Absolutely not, you cannot drive home after receiving sedation. Even a mild sedative can impair your judgment and reflexes, making it unsafe to drive. It’s crucial that you have someone drive you home and stay with you for a few hours afterward. Since your daughter is unavailable, we’ll need to arrange alternative transportation for you. Do you have any other family members or friends who could drive you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not really. Most of my friends are… well, they're not very mobile anymore. I’m afraid I'm on my own with that. Could… could the clinic help? Do you have a… a service that could take me home? I wouldn't want to bother anyone. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed again.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Kelder. We understand these things can be difficult. Yes, we do have a patient transportation service that we can arrange for you. It’s a paid service, but we can help you with the details. We also have a social worker who can assist you with finding alternative transportation options if needed. Let me see… I’m contacting the transportation service now to check their availability for your appointment date. One moment, please. Alright, good news. They have a driver available to pick you up after the endoscopy. We’ll schedule the pickup time to coincide with your discharge. I’ll have the paperwork ready for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. That takes a huge weight off my mind. No, I think that’s everything… for now. I’m still a little scared, but I feel… better prepared, I suppose. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. You’ve been very kind. I suppose we just… wait for the appointment now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my job to make sure you feel as comfortable and informed as possible. And yes, we just wait for the appointment now. I’ll have my nurse schedule a pre-endoscopy appointment for you to review the procedure in more detail and answer any further questions you may have. Remember, if you have any concerns or questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. I look forward to seeing you at your appointment.
