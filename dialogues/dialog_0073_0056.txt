DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s…well, it’s the students. Always the students. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge anymore. It’s…exhausting. And truthfully, I haven't the time for lengthy discussions about…feelings. Is there a quick way to resolve this? I have papers to grade, you see.
DOCTOR: Exhaustion…and difficulty with students. I see. While I appreciate you’re a busy man, Mr. Schlatterer, these concerns don't quite align with typical medical complaints. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms related to this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. Let me think…well, my back aches. It always aches. Old age, you understand. And I suppose I haven't been sleeping particularly well. But that’s likely the racket those youngsters make. It's a general…discomfort. Really, it’s more a matter of principle. They simply lack respect. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. Back pain and disrupted sleep. Let's explore those a bit further. When did the back pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years ago, I should imagine. Decades, perhaps. It comes and goes. It's…a general stiffness, you see. It flares up when I have to…deal with them. Honestly, pinning down a precise date is rather…beneath me. Are we going to discuss the students or my…ailments? Because frankly, the former is the root of all this trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration with the students, but I am a physician here to address your health concerns. It's difficult to determine the cause of your back pain without more specifics. Does anything specific trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Trigger? Yes, a poorly written essay, naturally. Or a student questioning a perfectly sound historical analysis. Honestly, the very act of teaching these days is…triggering. But if you must know about physical triggers…bending over, I suppose. And prolonged standing. Though that’s usually due to having to explain the simplest concepts repeatedly. Is this really necessary? This feels…intrusive.
DOCTOR: Bending and prolonged standing… alright. And you mentioned disrupted sleep. How many hours of sleep are you typically getting each night?
PATIENT: Hours? A few. Five, perhaps. It’s hardly restful, you understand. My mind races. Grading papers, formulating lesson plans…and contemplating the decline of academic standards. Honestly, it’s a wonder I get any sleep at all. I assure you, Dr. Korrell, this is not a sleep problem. It’s a…professional one. Can we simply write a note saying I’m…overworked? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Five hours of sleep, and a racing mind…Alright. Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate your…dedication, chronic sleep deprivation can significantly impact your health. Before we write any notes, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to rule out anything obvious contributing to your back pain and disrupted sleep. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really? For…stress? I assure you, Dr. Korrell, my body is perfectly…functional. It's my patience that's wearing thin. But…if it will expedite this process…very well. But I expect a swift and efficient examination. I haven't got all day. And please, be gentle. Old bones, you understand. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Please, if you’d just lie down on the table. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, rate is a bit elevated, but not alarming for his age. Lungs are clear bilaterally. There’s some tenderness in the lumbar region…and some muscle spasm. Range of motion is slightly limited. Your back muscles are quite tense, and there’s some discomfort with palpation. Do you experience any pain radiating down your legs?
