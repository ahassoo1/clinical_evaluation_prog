DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I should really get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good of your sister to encourage you to come in. It’s always best to get these things checked. “A bit high” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was at the pharmacy actually, when I was picking up some cream for my skin. The machine said 140 over something… I don't really remember the other number, to be honest. And then a couple of times at home, I borrowed my neighbor's machine, and it was around there too. Not every time, though. Sometimes it seemed normal. I don’t really understand all those numbers, to be clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. 140 is certainly something we want to investigate. It's good you noticed a difference at times, that's important. Not remembering the second number isn’t a problem, we'll get it sorted out here. Do you know if anyone else in your family has high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My mother definitely did. She was always at the doctor for it, especially when she got older. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had it too, I think. He wasn’t too good at looking after himself, though… always eating salt and rich foods. It seems to run in the family, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does seem that way, with your mother and uncle having similar issues. Family history is important. And you're right, lifestyle can play a big role. Now, besides your blood pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? And I’ve been a little tired lately, but I’m a busy woman, always on the go. I just figured it was that. Nothing specifically related to the blood pressure, I don’t think. No chest pain or anything like that, if that's what you were gonna ask.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no chest pain is certainly reassuring. Headaches and tiredness can be caused by many things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if everything else looks good. I’ll check your heart, lungs, and listen to your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. If you could just lie down for me, that would be great. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 142 over 88, and your pulse is 76 and regular. That confirms what you were seeing at the pharmacy. I’m also going to check your reflexes and look at your eyes just to make sure everything looks normal. Reflexes are normal, and your eyes look good.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Good to hear everything sounds okay, though. So, 142 over 88… is that really bad? Should I be worried? I don't want to end up like my mother, taking pills for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions. 142 over 88 is what we call Stage 1 hypertension. It's not an emergency, but it does need to be addressed. You're right to be proactive, and it’s good you don't want to end up needing medication immediately. We have options, and we’ll try lifestyle changes first. Before we get to those, I'd like to get a little more information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to take some cream for my eczema when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago. Nothing recently, though. No allergies at all. I do like a bit of bush tea sometimes, if that counts!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know! Bush tea doesn't typically cause any issues, so that’s not a concern. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the bush tea. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, so I try to stay healthy naturally. I eat a pretty good diet, I think. Lots of fish and vegetables, you know? My sister grows some amazing greens in her garden, and she always shares with me. Maybe a little salt, but not too much.
DOCTOR: That’s great that you're focusing on a healthy lifestyle already! That's a good foundation. Okay, and just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your work and how active you are during a typical week?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a caregiver, mostly helping people in their homes with everyday things. It’s a busy job! Lots of lifting and moving around, helping them with their washing, cooking, and taking them to appointments. So, I’m on my feet most of the day. It can be tiring, but it keeps me active, definitely. I don't really do much exercise outside of work though, if I'm honest. Just walking here and there. It’s hard to find the energy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better understanding. Being a caregiver is physically demanding, which is good, but it also means you're under a lot of stress. Stress can definitely raise blood pressure. Now, before we talk about a plan, I’d like to order a couple of tests just to rule out any underlying causes. I want to do a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. Also, I think an EKG would be a good idea, just to check your heart's electrical activity. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help to find out what’s going on, then yes, absolutely. I trust your judgement. An EKG… is that painful? I’ve never had one before. And I’m fine with the other tests too, whatever you need.
DOCTOR: No, an EKG is completely painless. It involves placing a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. We'll get those tests ordered right away, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, let's talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. We can start with reducing your salt intake, even a little bit, and incorporating some stress-reducing techniques, like deep breathing or gentle stretching. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds manageable. Salt… that’ll be the hardest part, I think. I love a bit of flavor in my food! But I can try. And stress… yes, that’s definitely something I need to work on. I get so caught up in looking after others, I forget to look after myself. Deep breathing… I can try that too. Gentle stretching sounds nice. So, cut down on salt, try deep breathing and stretching… and then we’ll see what the tests say? That sounds like a plan, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: That’s a great attitude! Yes, that's exactly the plan. I’m going to write you a handout with some tips on reducing salt intake and some simple deep breathing exercises. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results and see how you're doing with the lifestyle changes. If you experience any chest pain, severe headache, or vision changes before your appointment, please call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything really clearly, Doctor. I feel a lot better knowing we’re doing something about it. And thank you for being so patient with me. I worry a lot, you know. So, two weeks, and I’ll try my best with the salt and the breathing… and I'll watch out for those symptoms. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Remember, taking small steps is key, and I'm confident you can make positive changes. Here’s the handout, and the nurse will come in shortly to schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, and take care of yourself!
