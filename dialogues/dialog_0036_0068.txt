DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. After the… the cancer stuff. You know? It's just… puffy. It's annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I see. “The cancer stuff” – meaning your prior cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s a good way to put it. It was a long time ago now, but… yes. The treatment. They did a lot. And now this leg. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of swelling in one leg after cancer treatment. Can you tell me where exactly on your leg is it swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s mostly… down here. And a little bit around my ankle too. Not my thigh, just the lower part of my leg. It feels… tight, you know? Like a big rubber band.
DOCTOR: Alright, calf and ankle swelling, tightness. Has it been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, gradually. Very gradually. It wasn’t… bam, like that. Just… little by little. I didn’t even really notice at first, to be honest. I thought it was just… old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: It's good you brought it to our attention now. Any pain associated with the swelling, Sasha?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. And sometimes it feels… warm. Not hot, but… warm. Does that make sense? And it’s a bit… tender if I poke it. But not a sharp pain, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – uncomfortable, warm, tender to the touch. Have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin… hmm. I don’t think so. It’s… the same color, I guess. Maybe a little red sometimes, but I don’t know if that’s just from my socks. It’s not shiny or anything. No open sores, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in color, shininess, or sores. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently, aside from the leg swelling?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I’m… tired, but I’m always tired. I'm an old woman, you know? I eat okay, I think. Maybe a little too much chocolate, but who doesn't? Nothing… major. No fever, no cough, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Ask away. I don’t remember everything, mind you. It was a long time ago, and… well, I forget things. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we’ll take our time. You mentioned cancer treatment previously – do you know what type of cancer you were treated for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It was… breast cancer, I think. Yes, that’s right. It was a long time ago. They… did surgery, and then… radiation, I think. And maybe some… pills? It’s all a bit fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer treated with surgery and radiation, possibly some pills as well. Do you recall what kind of pills, or when you stopped taking them, if you do recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The pills… no, I don't remember the names. They were… small and white, I think. But that could be any pill, couldn’t it? I stopped taking them… a long time ago. Years and years. After the radiation, I think. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I just remember being very tired.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Sasha. It was a long time ago, and treatment can be difficult. Let’s move on. Any other significant medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Significant problems… Oh, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… arthritis, I suppose. It's just… old age again, isn’t it? It aches sometimes. And my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that. A pink one.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and high blood pressure. You mentioned taking a pink pill for the high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have it at home… in the little pill organizer. I really don't know the name. It's pink. My daughter usually handles all that. I just take the pills she gives me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no worries at all. We can look it up later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Not to food, not to pills, not to anything. Well… I get a little itchy when I'm around cats, but that's just a little sniffle, not a real allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, one last question about your medical history. Do you have a family history of blood clots or swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: Blood clots… oh dear. Let me think. My aunt… my mother’s sister… she had something in her leg, years ago. It was… bad. She was in the hospital for a long time. Was that a blood clot? I don’t really remember the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of possible blood clot. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just try not to poke too hard, okay? My leg is a little tender.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be gentle. I'm just going to check your leg and the other one, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. First, let's take a look at your leg. Can you point to where it's most swollen?
PATIENT: It’s right here. And a little bit around my ankle, see? It feels… tightest right there. And warmer, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling your calf now. It is warmer to the touch compared to your other leg, and it is slightly more tender. I’m also noting some mild swelling. Now, I’m going to measure the circumference of both legs, just to get an accurate comparison. Your right calf measures 38 centimeters, and your left calf measures 36 centimeters. Your right ankle measures 24 centimeters, and your left ankle measures 22 centimeters. This confirms some swelling in your right leg. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in both feet to see if they're the same.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Numbers… that’s good you’re writing all that down. I’m terrible with numbers. Pulses, you say? Alright, do what you need to do. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are both present and feel equal in strength. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Now, I think it would be best to get some blood tests done to help determine the cause of the swelling in your leg. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Numbers again! Everything sounds… good, I guess? As good as it can be for an old woman. Blood tests… alright, yes, do what you think is best. I just want to get this leg sorted out. It’s annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. The blood tests will help us rule out some possible causes, such as a blood clot, and check your kidney function, as that can sometimes contribute to swelling. I'm going to order a D-dimer test, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. I'll also order a venous ultrasound of your right leg to check for blood clots. The lab technician will draw some blood, and you’ll need to schedule an appointment for the ultrasound. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… so many tests! D-dimer… that sounds scary. Ultrasound too. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel a bit overwhelmed. Is… is this serious? Is it a blood clot? That’s what my aunt had.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sasha. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with a lot of tests. The D-dimer test can help us rule out a blood clot, but it's not always definitive. That's why we’re also doing the ultrasound, which will give us a clearer picture of the veins in your leg. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I can’t definitively say if it’s a blood clot yet. Your symptoms could be caused by something else, like fluid retention or a minor injury. We need to get these tests done to get a proper diagnosis. I want to reassure you that we are taking this seriously and will work quickly to figure out what’s going on. Would you like me to go over the potential causes of leg swelling with you?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That’s… good to hear you’re taking it seriously. Yes, please. Tell me what could be causing it. Fluid retention? What’s that? I just want to understand. It’s just… worrying, you know? Especially with my aunt.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, especially with your family history. Leg swelling can be caused by a number of things. Fluid retention, also known as edema, happens when fluid builds up in your tissues. This can be caused by things like prolonged standing or sitting, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions like heart failure or kidney problems. Another possible cause is a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, which is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. This can cause pain, swelling, redness, and warmth. Other less common causes include infection, injury, or a problem with the lymphatic system. Because of your history of breast cancer treatment and your family history of a blood clot, we want to rule out a DVT first. The ultrasound will help us do that. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg when you're sitting or lying down, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… elevate it, compression stockings, stay hydrated. I can do that. That doesn’t sound too bad. But… is a DVT really bad? What happens if it is that?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question. A DVT can be serious, but it’s also treatable. If a blood clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. That’s why it’s important to diagnose and treat a DVT quickly. Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, and dizziness. If you experience any of these symptoms, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Fortunately, most people with a DVT can be treated effectively with blood-thinning medications, also known as anticoagulants. These medications help prevent the clot from growing larger and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. We are ordering these tests so we can determine if you have a DVT and, if so, get you started on treatment right away. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Okay… blood thinners. I’ve heard of those. Yes, I think… yes, that’s fine. As long as we figure out what’s going on. And you’ll tell me the results as soon as they’re ready? I just… I don’t want to be like my aunt. She was very sick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get the results back as soon as possible – typically within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you directly with the results, and we can discuss the next steps. And I want to reassure you again that we are taking this seriously and will do everything we can to make sure you get the best possible care. We’re being proactive by ordering these tests, and that’s the best way to address your concerns and prevent any complications. Here’s my direct line. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or worsening swelling in your leg. Now, are there any other questions I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. No… I think that’s all for now. I just… want to go home and put my leg up. And drink some water. Thank you for listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. That’s a great plan – rest and hydration. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood, and the scheduling department will contact you to set up your ultrasound appointment. We’ll be in touch soon with the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
