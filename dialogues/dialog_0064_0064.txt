DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It's like... a squeezing.
DOCTOR: Yes, a squeezing sensation. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it started maybe a week ago? It comes and goes. Usually when I’m walking, especially uphill. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, though. And it goes away if I stop and rest for a bit. I was making arepas yesterday, and I felt it a little then, too. Not bad, just... there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about a week, brought on by activity – walking uphill, even something like making arepas. And it relieves with rest. Does the pain radiate anywhere – to your arm, jaw, neck, or shoulder, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, no, it stays right here. Just… right here. It doesn’t go anywhere else. My arms are fine, and my jaw feels okay. I did feel a little breathless once when it was hurting, but that went away quick when I sat down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's localized to your chest, doesn't radiate. And you experienced some breathlessness along with the pain, which also resolved with rest. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this, Sherion?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, I’ve been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just because of the heat. It's been so hot! And my stomach... it's been a little upset. Maybe some indigestion? But I eat the same things all the time, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and some indigestion alongside the chest pain. And you haven't changed your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing changed. Arepas, arroz con pollo, some fruit… the usual. My husband makes a good soup, too, but I haven't been wanting much of that lately. Even when my stomach feels okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you ever had any issues with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. The doctor always says my blood pressure is good. Medicare checks everything every year. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I walk every day, you know? Well, when the chest doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Let me just pull up your records here… yes, I see your annual check-ups are all up-to-date and your blood pressure is consistently within a normal range. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing at all. I can take most things, I think. I took some pills once for my arthritis, but that was years ago. It didn’t really help, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned some arthritis, but it doesn't seem to be a current issue?
PATIENT: No, not really. It bothers me a little on cold days, just a stiffness in my fingers. Nothing serious. I rub some cream on it and it’s fine. It doesn’t hurt with the chest pain, though. They’re different things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Breathe in… and out… Again… Your pulse is regular, but a little on the faster side, which could be related to the discomfort. And I’m hearing some normal breath sounds, but I'll listen more carefully after you walk on the treadmill for a few minutes. I want to check how your heart responds to exertion. Do you feel comfortable doing that?
PATIENT: A treadmill? Oh… I haven’t used one of those in… well, a long time. I can walk, but… running? No, no running. Is it okay if I just walk? Slowly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. No running at all! We’ll start very slowly, just a comfortable walking pace. It's simply to see how your heart functions with a little bit of activity. We'll monitor your heart rate and blood pressure throughout, and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Would you like me to explain what I’m looking for as we go?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would make me feel better. I don't want to feel scared or anything. Just tell me what you're looking at. And if it hurts, I’ll tell you right away, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. That's exactly what we'll do. We're looking for any changes in your heart rhythm or blood pressure that might indicate why you're experiencing the chest pain. We'll start at a very slow pace and gradually increase it if you feel comfortable. We'll be monitoring your EKG and blood pressure the whole time. If you feel anything – any discomfort, dizziness, shortness of breath – just let me know immediately, and we'll stop. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I trust you. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just start walking at a comfortable pace. No need to rush. I'm going to attach this EKG monitor and blood pressure cuff now. Okay, we’re all set. Just focus on your breathing and walk at a pace that feels comfortable. Remember, any discomfort, and we stop immediately. Let me know how you're feeling.
PATIENT: Okay… It feels… okay so far. A little strange, but okay. My breathing is… good, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, Sherion. That's great. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that's not uncommon with a little exertion. Keep breathing steadily. We'll just walk for another minute or so, and then we'll slow down. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: It's starting to feel a little tight… Not bad, but… I feel it. Like a squeezing again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, let’s stop right there. You did great. Don’t worry, we’ve gathered enough information for now. The EKG didn’t show any major abnormalities, but your description and the feeling you experienced on the treadmill are concerning. It sounds like you may be experiencing angina—chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to your heart. It’s important we investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood tests and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Angina? Oh dear… That sounds… serious. Blood tests and an… echo-what-you-called-it? Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s necessary. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong and if it’s something I need to worry about.
DOCTOR: It's important to get it checked, Sherion. Angina can be serious, but it's also very treatable. The blood tests will help us look for markers of heart disease, and the echocardiogram is a non-invasive scan that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. It will show us how well your heart is pumping and if there are any areas of weakness. I’ll have my assistant schedule those tests for you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose aspirin to help prevent blood clots and a medication called nitroglycerin, which you can take under your tongue if you experience chest pain. It will help to open up your blood vessels and relieve the discomfort. I'll explain the dosage and side effects to you in detail before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aspirin… and another pill? Oh dear… I don't like taking so many pills. But if it helps, okay. Explain it to me slowly, please. And… what does "non-invasive" mean? Is it going to hurt? I’m a little scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherion. I understand your concerns. “Non-invasive” simply means we won’t be inserting anything into your body. The echocardiogram is performed by placing a small probe on your chest – it doesn’t hurt at all, it just feels a little cool. It's like getting an ultrasound. We’ll get detailed pictures of your heart without any needles or incisions. The aspirin helps thin your blood, making it less likely to form clots, and the nitroglycerin works by widening your blood vessels, improving blood flow to your heart. I’ll start you on a very low dose of both. We’ll monitor how you’re feeling and adjust the dosage if needed. I’ll have my assistant explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have before you leave. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a week to discuss the test results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds a little better. No needles… good. And just a small thing on my chest. Okay. A week… yes, that’s good. I like knowing I’m getting checked. And… will the pills interact with my Medicare insurance? I don’t want any surprises with the bills.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Sherion. Let me check… Yes, both the aspirin and the nitroglycerin are covered under your Medicare plan. There may be a small co-pay, but my assistant will confirm the exact amount when scheduling your appointment and prescriptions. They’re very familiar with Medicare coverage and can help you navigate any billing concerns. We want to make sure you have everything you need without any financial worries. Is there anything else I can explain or clarify for you at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained it all very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little at ease. I'm still a little scared, but… I feel better knowing we’re figuring it out.
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could help, Sherion. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared, but we’re going to take this one step at a time. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the prescriptions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any chest pain before your appointment, or if you have any questions at all. We’re here to support you. And remember, we’re doing this together. Now, let me walk you out and have my assistant meet you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That means a lot.
