DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my back. Lower back, mostly. Been botherin’ me for…oh, a good while now, I reckon. It just…aches. Feels kinda weak, too. Not a sharp pain, just…old. Like somethin’ is breakin’ little by little.
DOCTOR: "A good while now…" Alright. And when you say "a good while," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It really started gettin’ bad after I helped my nephew move some boxes last November. November… 2024, that was. Before that, it was just little twinges, you know? But liftin’ those boxes…oof. That made it worse. Been steady since then, just…slowly gettin’ more and more uncomfortable. I don’t remember ever hurtin’ my back before that move, not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, November of 2024, after helpin' with the move. And you’d describe it as a steady ache, gettin’ worse over time. Not a sharp, sudden pain?
PATIENT: That’s right. No sudden pain, no. Just… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like it’s travelin’ down my leg a little bit, too. Not all the way, just… kinda in the hip and upper part of the leg. And it's worse when I stand for a long time, or if I try to bend over. Sittin' isn’t too bad, usually. Except for long periods. Then it gets stiff.
DOCTOR: Right. So, the ache radiates down into your hip and upper leg, worse with standing and bending, better when sitting, but stiffness develops with prolonged sitting. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness, no tingle. Just… weakness, sometimes. Like my legs are gonna give out if I stand too long. It's a funny feelin’. Not a bad feelin’, exactly, just…unreliable, I guess. Like I need to be careful. I mostly just take it easy now, try not to push it. But… well, I gotta keep movin’, ya know? Gotta do things. Fundraising doesn't do itself!
DOCTOR: Fundraising, alright. And you haven't experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder habits, have you?
PATIENT: Changes in…what now? Bowel? Bladder? Oh. You mean… goin’ to the bathroom? No, nothin’ like that. Everything's normal there. Regular as clockwork, I’d say. No trouble at all. Sorry, Doctor, I’m not used to talkin’ about these things. It’s just…my back hurts, that's all. I thought we were talkin’ about my back.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Mr. Vankampen. Those questions are just routine. It's important to rule things out. Now, let’s get back to your back. Have you tried any treatments for it already?
PATIENT: Oh, a little bit. My daughter, she’s a nurse, told me to try some heat. And I use some of those liniment rubs, you know? The ones that smell like wintergreen? They help a little, take the edge off for a bit. And I’ve tried takin’ some of those over-the-counter pain pills, but they don’t seem to do much good, and I don’t like takin’ too many of those. Mostly I just try to rest it. And be careful, like I said. I haven’t gone to a doctor about it before this, though. Never really needed to. Just gettin’ old, I figured.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heat, liniment rubs, over-the-counter pain relievers with limited relief. And you haven’t had any previous injuries to your back that you recall?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ major. When I was a boy, back in Lebanon, I slipped on some rocks while swimmin’ and bumped my back pretty good. But that was… oh, seventy years ago! Didn’t bother me much, not for long anyway. Just a bruise. Not like this. This is… different. It’s a deep ache, like somethin’ inside is wearin’ out. That’s the best way I can explain it. I don’t remember ever hurtin’ my back bad enough to go see a doctor before this. This is new.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant back injuries aside from a childhood incident. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your range of motion and reflexes, and see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s gonna hurt, okay? I’m not a young man anymore, and I don’t bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vankampen. I'll be gentle. If anything is uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, if you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. Alright. I'm feeling some tenderness along your lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. Your range of motion is limited, and there's some muscle spasm. Reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. I don't detect any weakness in your legs. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a lumbar strain. It's common with age and can be aggravated by lifting or strain. However, given the persistence of your symptoms and the radiation down your leg, I'd like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back – just to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: X-ray… hmm. That sounds… serious. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then okay. I trust you. I don’t want anythin’ serious, but I want to know what’s goin’ on. My daughter always says I wait too long to go to the doctor. Maybe she’s right. So, yes, an X-ray. When can we do that? Will it hurt? And… will it show what’s wearin’ out, like I said?
DOCTOR: It’s a good idea to be thorough, Mr. Vankampen. And your daughter sounds like a very sensible woman. The X-ray itself shouldn’t hurt at all. You’ll just lie still while the machine takes a picture. It’s a very quick procedure. It will help us visualize the bones in your lower back and rule out any fractures or other structural problems. It won’t show exactly what’s wearing out, but it will give us a clearer picture of the underlying cause of your pain. I’ll write an order for the X-ray now. The radiology department is just down the hall. They'll call you when they're ready. While you’re waiting, I’m going to recommend you start with some over-the-counter pain relief - ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. And I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the results of the X-ray. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I can take ibuprofen, I think. My daughter gives it to me sometimes when my arthritis flares up. I mostly try to tough it out, though. But… okay, I’ll try the ibuprofen. And no liftin’, right? Even small boxes? This fundraising…it involves a lot of boxes. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Alright, good. And yes, no lifting at all until we get the X-ray results. We need to let your back rest. Perhaps you could delegate some of the lifting duties to someone else for now. I'm also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in one week, regardless of the X-ray results, so we can discuss a long-term management plan. If the pain worsens significantly or you develop any new symptoms – such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. A week, no liftin’, ibuprofen… and call if things get worse. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I appreciate it. I'll go down to radiology now and get this X-ray done. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this.
