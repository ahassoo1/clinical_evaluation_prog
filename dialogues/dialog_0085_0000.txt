DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...fine. I suppose. I came because my legs just suddenly feel like jelly. It started a few days ago, after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, that cold. I just woke up one morning and poof – wobbly legs. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I'm a tour guide, you see, and you can’t exactly tour when you can barely stand.
DOCTOR: I see. Wobbly legs after a cold – that's certainly concerning, especially with your job. It's good you came in to get it checked out. So, this started a few days ago after you recovered from a cold. Can you describe what you mean by “jelly legs”?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a little wobble, Doctor. It’s…difficult to explain. Like trying to stand on water. They just don’t feel solid, you know? It’s not painful, exactly, just…weak. Very weak. I have to really concentrate to walk, and even then I feel like I might fall. And it's both legs. Equally. Which is…odd, isn't it? Usually things are just one side, aren't they?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not odd at all for it to be both legs. That actually helps us narrow things down. "Not solid," and "very weak" – those are good descriptions. So it’s not accompanied by any pain, numbness, or tingling?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a tingle, not a burn, nothing like that. Just…gone. Like the strength just vanished. It’s really quite frustrating, honestly. People pay good money for my tours, and I need to be able to, well, tour them. It’s a professional embarrassment, really. I pride myself on being a knowledgeable and efficient guide, and now…now I’m practically useless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. It's good you're so aware of your body and how this is affecting your work. We'll try to figure out what's going on. Let’s go through some basics. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Hmm. Let me think. No fever, like I said, the cold is completely gone. No dizziness, though I do feel a little…off balance, which is probably the legs. My appetite is fine, I suppose. And…no, nothing else really. I haven’t been feeling sick, just…weak. And irritated, to be perfectly honest. It's a very disruptive situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, appetite is normal, and you’re feeling generally well other than the weakness and irritation. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I had a hysterectomy years ago, that was…1998, I believe. And high blood pressure, yes, but it's controlled with medication. I take a little pill every day. Losartan, I think it’s called. Other than that…no, nothing major. No diabetes, no fancy autoimmune things. I keep pretty healthy, considering. I walk a lot, you know, with the tours.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy in 1998 and controlled high blood pressure with Losartan. That’s good to know. And you say you generally stay healthy and walk a lot. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Losartan, Doctor. And a multivitamin, every morning with breakfast. Nothing special. I don’t really believe in all those fancy supplements people take. Waste of money, if you ask me. I get my vitamins from my food. Well, mostly. I do enjoy a good pastry now and then, admittedly. But generally, healthy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Firestone. A multivitamin and Losartan. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite lucky in that regard. My ex-husband, now he was allergic to everything. Pollen, dust, cats, shellfish…it was a nightmare. But me? No. Perfectly allergy-free. I’m sure that’s why I’m able to travel so much. A blocked nose wouldn't do for a tour guide, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And it's good you're able to travel without those issues. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just get me back on my feet as quickly as possible. I have a tour scheduled for next week, and I really don't want to cancel it. The clients have been planning this for months, you see. And frankly, the reputation… it's important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll do our best. First, could you please stand for me?
PATIENT: There. Standing. Though, I must say, it’s a bit wobbly. Perhaps you can see what I mean. It's not a dramatic collapse, but it’s certainly…unsteady.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. Okay. Now, can you walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Like this. As you can see, it’s not my usual brisk pace. I feel like a newborn foal. Very awkward. And I have to really concentrate to keep my balance. It’s quite exhausting, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Just a few steps is good. I notice you are walking with a slightly wider stance than usual, and you are concentrating to keep your balance. Now, could you please sit back down for me?
PATIENT: There. Much better. Sitting is considerably less…precarious. Honestly, Doctor, this is most unsettling. I’ve never felt like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It’s good we’re getting a clearer picture. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will involve a small hammer on your knees and ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A hammer? On my knees? Oh, dear. Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds… unpleasant. I have sensitive knees, you know. Years of walking, I suppose. But, alright, if you insist. Just be gentle, please. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Ms. Firestone. It's a quick tap, nothing forceful. Let's start with your knees. Could you please let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: There. Dangling. Though I’m not sure I approve of this. It feels rather…exposed. Get it over with quickly, please. And gently!
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good. Your reflexes are present, a little on the quiet side, but that’s not necessarily cause for concern at this point. Now, let’s check your ankles. Could you please flex your feet upward?
PATIENT: Upward. Like this? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. Is there anything more… conventional we can do? Perhaps a blood pressure check? Or a look in my ears? Anything but hammers!
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Your ankle reflexes are also present but a bit quiet. No cause for alarm yet. I have already checked your blood pressure earlier, and it was well controlled. Everything seems normal so far, but the diminished reflexes and the weakness are concerning. I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying causes, like vitamin deficiencies or other medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding. Very well. If it will help get me back on my feet, I suppose. But please tell me it won’t take long. I have a tour to prepare for, you know. And I do hate needles. A truly barbaric invention, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Firestone. It won't take long, just a few vials of blood. And we’ll send it to the lab right away. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist. They are specialists in nerve and muscle disorders, and they can help us determine the cause of your weakness and recommend the best course of treatment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Are you saying it could be something really bad? Honestly, Doctor, I just had a cold! Surely it’s nothing more than lingering weakness. A bit of rest, perhaps some vitamin supplements, and I'll be right as rain. A neurologist sounds…excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s important to rule out anything concerning. The diminished reflexes and persistent weakness do warrant further investigation. A neurologist is the best person to do that. They'll perform some more specialized tests and help us get to the bottom of this. Think of it as being thorough, not alarming. We're just covering all our bases to ensure you get the best possible care. We can start with the blood work, and then we’ll schedule the neurology appointment if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Blood work first, then… then we’ll see about this neurologist. But if it turns out to be nothing more than a lingering cold, I expect a full apology. And a complimentary vitamin B12 injection. I've heard those are quite invigorating. And perhaps a discount on my next tour… just to compensate for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: That sounds fair, Ms. Firestone. We'll do our best to get you back to your usual self. I'll write the orders for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take good care of you. Here’s the lab request. And I’ll have the nurse schedule the neurology consultation for you. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… get this over with quickly, please. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. And a tour to prepare for. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never felt so helpless in my life. A tour guide should be leading adventures, not undergoing medical examinations!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Firestone. We’ll do everything we can to get you back on your feet quickly. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions. And I hope you feel better soon.
