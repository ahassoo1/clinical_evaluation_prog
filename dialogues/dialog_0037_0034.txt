DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, right. I just… moved here. I think I need to, like, get checked out 'cause I'm new to the area? I have Medicare, if that helps. It's all kinda new.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Establishing care with a new doctor when you move is a very smart thing to do. And yes, knowing you have Medicare is helpful. So, to clarify, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment, or is this more of a general “welcome to the practice” check-up?
PATIENT: Um… general check-up, I think? I don’t think anything’s wrong, but… I forget things a lot. Like, I just moved, but I can't really remember when exactly. Does that make sense? I just wanna make sure everything’s okay, ya know? It's just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. Memory concerns are always worth investigating. So, you're experiencing some difficulty recalling recent events, specifically the timing of your move. Has this been a long-standing issue, or is this something new that started around the time of the move?
PATIENT: Umm… it’s hard to say. I think it’s been… a while? I always kinda had trouble remembering dates and stuff, but maybe it's worse now? I dunno. My husband usually reminds me of things. He's pretty good at that. I just... don't want to be a bother, ya know? It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have support at home. And you're not a bother at all – that’s what I’m here for. Okay, so some ongoing difficulty with dates and recall, potentially worsened recently. Aside from the memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired sometimes. But everyone gets tired, right? And… I kinda get headaches, but not often. They're like, just normal headaches. Not, like, super bad. I don't know… Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not explaining it very well. It’s all just kinda… there.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly fine, Emileigh. It's helpful to know all of this. Fatigue and occasional headaches are common, but it's good you mentioned them. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Umm… it's just… I feel sleepy a lot. Even after I sleep. Like, I can sleep for eight hours and still feel tired when I wake up. It doesn't really stop me from doing things, but it's just… annoying, ya know? And sometimes I just feel… blah. Like I don’t have energy for much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Feeling tired even after adequate sleep and experiencing a general lack of energy – that’s important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Umm… I think I had… strep throat when I was little? And… maybe the flu? I don’t really remember a lot of it. I don’t think I have anything serious. My husband usually handles all the doctor stuff, so I’m not really sure. I’m sorry. I feel like I’m not being helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Emileigh. It's perfectly alright that you don’t have all the details. We can work through this together. Okay, so possible strep throat and the flu as a child, but no known chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Umm… no, I don’t think so. Definitely not any surgeries. I would remember that, right? I mean… I think. My tonsils maybe? When I was little? But I'm not sure. It was a long time ago. I really don’t know. Everything's kinda… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known surgeries, possibly a tonsillectomy in childhood. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Umm… my grandma on my mom’s side had… something with her heart, I think? But I don't know what, exactly. And my dad's side… I think someone had diabetes? But I'm really not sure. Nobody really talks about it much. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I'm just… bad with remembering stuff like that. It's really frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Family history can be difficult to recall. A potential heart condition in your maternal grandmother and possible diabetes in your paternal family – that’s good to know. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never have. My husband doesn't either. We both kinda just… relax at home. He likes to fish, and I like to… well, I like to try and remember things, I guess. We’re pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: There's absolutely nothing wrong with a quiet life, Emileigh. It sounds very peaceful. And now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I’m allergic to being tired, I guess, but that’s not a real allergy, right? Seriously, though, I don't think I have any allergies. My husband always checks when he gets me medicine, so if there was something, he'd know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh, that gives me a good starting point. To get a clearer picture of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some routine blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out why I'm so… fuzzy. And tired. That sounds good, yeah. Blood work and… a check-up. Okay.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll have a seat there, I’ll start with checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That all sounds… fine. I’m a little nervous, but… I trust you. Just… tell me if anything seems wrong, okay? I just don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You won’t be a bother at all, Emileigh. And I will absolutely let you know if I see anything concerning. First, let’s just get your blood pressure and pulse. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your arm. …Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, which is normal. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute, also within the normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Next, I’ll check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… okay. Everything feels… normal, I guess. My knees always kinda… jerk a lot, though. My husband says it's just me being silly. That’s… always a bit startling.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Emileigh. Reflexes can vary from person to person, and it’s not uncommon for them to be a bit brisk. Yours are a little lively, as you say, but not concerning. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please just keep your eyes focused on my finger. Your eye movements seem good. Next, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Umm… Okay, I can do that. Let me think… Today is… August… 2nd? I think. 2025. Is that right? I'm not very good with dates, you know. I hope I got that right. It's all kinda… blurry.
DOCTOR: That is correct, August 2nd, 2025. No worries at all, Emileigh. It's good you were able to recall that. Let's try one more simple question. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Umm… Oh… that's… that's a good question. I think… I think it's… a suburban city? Like… lots of houses? I don’t know the name, though. We just moved here, remember? I’m so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. This is awful. I'm making a mess of this, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You are not making a mess of anything at all, Emileigh. It’s perfectly alright. You’ve just moved, and it’s understandable that you might be a little disoriented. This information is helpful. Okay, based on the physical exam and your responses, there are some things I’d like to investigate further. Specifically, the difficulty with recent memory and recall. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin B12 level. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. I’d also like to order a basic cognitive assessment, which involves a few simple tests to evaluate your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best. That sounds… good, I guess. Tests and… assessments. I just want to know what's wrong, you know? And hopefully… hopefully, it’s not too serious. Can I… can I still drive after the tests? I have to pick up my husband from fishing later.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Emileigh. It's good that you want to get to the bottom of this. Yes, you should be able to drive after the blood tests. They don’t involve any sedatives or medications that would impair your driving ability. However, the cognitive assessment may take about 30-45 minutes, so you might want to plan accordingly. I’ll have the lab order sent to the lab next door. They should be able to accommodate you today. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, dizziness, weakness, or confusion, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Umm… no, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been really nice. I was really worried, but you’ve made me feel a lot better. Just… let me know when the tests are ready, okay? And thank you again. I appreciate it. Should I just… go to the lab next door now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could ease your worries. Yes, please go to the lab next door whenever you’re ready. They’ll be expecting you. And my nurse will contact you as soon as the results are back to schedule a follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Get going and have a nice afternoon picking up your husband. And please remember to stay hydrated.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. You too. I will. Bye, Doctor.
