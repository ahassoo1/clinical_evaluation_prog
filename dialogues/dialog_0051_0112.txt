DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the restroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, I mean. It’s been… frequent. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I'm not quite sure why it’s happening, and it’s a little disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, okay. It is disruptive when things change like that. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It's not painful, thankfully. Just… a constant urge. I feel like I’ve just gone, and then… not very long after, I need to go again. It's been going on for… oh dear, I can't quite pinpoint exactly when it started. Perhaps a few weeks? It's hard to say, I'm afraid. I don’t really keep track of things like that. And it seems to be… all the time, really. Day and night. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, day and night… alright. No pain, that's good. It's definitely not normal to be going to the restroom that frequently, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand a little better, are you noticing any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been rather thirsty, actually. More so than usual. And… now that you mention it, I suppose I have been feeling a bit tired lately. Just generally run down. But I thought that was just… life, you know? I haven't been sleeping particularly well, either. But I don’t know if that's connected. It's all a bit muddled, I’m afraid. I don’t recall anything else specific, no.
DOCTOR: Thirst, tiredness, and some trouble sleeping… okay. That does give me a bit more to work with. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. I had… something when I was younger, I believe. A childhood illness, perhaps? Nothing serious, as far as I recall. And… I had my gallbladder removed several years ago. That was… quite a while back now. Apart from that… no, not that I'm aware of. My memory isn't what it used to be, I’m afraid. I was divorced a few years back, if that counts as a medical condition!
DOCTOR: Divorce is certainly… stressful! But we’re talking medical history here. Gallbladder removal, okay, I'll make a note of that. And you said a childhood illness?
PATIENT: Yes, a childhood illness. It was… something with a fever, I think. And a rash. But it was a very long time ago. I really can't recall the specifics. My mother would have known, but… she passed away several years ago. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It's frustrating, even for me. I really wish I could be more helpful. I’m not currently taking any medications, by the way. And I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It's perfectly understandable, and we'll work with what we have. No current medications or allergies, that's good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Does anyone in your family have diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a good question. My father… I believe he had something, yes. He wasn’t very forthcoming about his health, to be honest. I think it was diabetes, or something similar. He passed away quite a long time ago. And my mother… I don't recall. I really don't. I'm afraid my family history isn't very clear to me. I wasn't very close to either of them, if I’m being honest. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. It seems I don’t have many answers for you.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Keoni. We’re gathering information, and we’re doing the best we can with what we have. A father with a possible history of diabetes is good to know. Alright, just a few questions about your lifestyle now. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. I’ve always been quite careful with my health, even if my memory isn’t the best. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing excessive. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I'm not very active, though, I must admit. I spend a lot of time on my feet at work, being a concierge, but it's not really… exercise, is it? More just… standing.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine, healthy diet, mostly standing at work. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t involve needles, I think I’ll be alright. I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. But a quick exam sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment entirely. I just… I hope you can figure out what’s causing this. It’s quite unsettling, constantly needing to go to the restroom.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No needles today, I promise. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Alright, that was quick. I’m going to order a urinalysis to check for any infection, and a blood glucose test to check your blood sugar levels. Would you be able to provide a urine sample now?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A urine sample, certainly. I can do that. Blood sugar levels… that sounds sensible. Is the elevated blood pressure something to be worried about? My father always had high blood pressure, I believe. And, if you don't mind my asking, what do you suspect might be causing all of this? I’m rather anxious, to be honest. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned your father’s history of high blood pressure. It does suggest there may be a genetic component, and we’ll need to monitor it closely. Right now, it's a little elevated, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be due to stress, or just a temporary fluctuation. As for what’s causing all of this, several things could be at play. The frequent urination, thirst, and tiredness, combined with your father’s history, raise the possibility of diabetes. However, it could also be a urinary tract infection, or even just a sign of dehydration. That’s why we’re doing the urinalysis and blood glucose test – to help narrow down the possibilities. Let’s get the tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan. If you’ll follow me, there’s a restroom just down the hall where you can provide a urine sample. A cup will be provided.
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… sensible. Urinalysis and blood glucose test. I can certainly do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease somewhat. Lead the way, please. I’ll be right behind you. And thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. It's very much appreciated.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. That’s what I’m here for. Take your time with the sample. Once you're finished, just bring the cup back to the examination room, and I’ll get it sent to the lab. I'll be right here when you get back. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
