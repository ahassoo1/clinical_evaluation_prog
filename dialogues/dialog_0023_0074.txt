DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Versace. Now, you’re 90 years young – quite a milestone. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s just… my blood pressure’s been a little high, the nurse told me. Seems to be gettin’ worse lately, and I figured I oughta get it checked proper. Don’t wanna keel over mid-bake, you know? I make the best pies this side of the Mississippi.
DOCTOR: “Keel over mid-bake,” indeed. A noble cause to maintain, I suppose. And high blood pressure is something we should address. The nurse took a preliminary reading, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. Took it twice, I think. Said it was up a bit both times. I don't rightly remember the numbers, honey. Numbers ain’t my strong suit, never have been. I just know it wasn’t good. Felt a little dizzy afterwards, but that might just be from sittin’ still too long. I’m usually movin’. Baking keeps you on your feet, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here the readings were 152/88 and 158/92. Not ideal, certainly. And dizziness after a blood pressure check can be related, though it's worth investigating further. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, Ms. Steines, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t recall ever bein’ told I had high blood pressure 'fore. The doctor back in Stilwell, old Dr. Abernathy, he always just checked my heart and told me I was doin' alright. He retired years ago, though. Maybe he caught somethin’ and told my daughter? I don’t remember. I've always felt pretty good, all things considered. Just the usual aches and pains for an old woman, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no previous diagnosis of hypertension. That's useful to know. And you mentioned "usual aches and pains." Can you tell me a little more about those?
PATIENT: Well, mostly in my joints. Knees bother me somethin’ awful, especially when the weather changes. And my back… oh, my back. Been bad since I was a young woman, workin’ in the fields. It gets stiff and sore, and I gotta take it easy sometimes. Mostly, I just work slower when it's botherin' me. And sometimes my hands get a little cramped up, makin' pie crusts. It’s nothin’ terrible, just… old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Knees, back, hands... all common with age and activity. Let's move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had high blood pressure, heart trouble, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s a tough one. My mama… she died young, from a fever when I was just a little girl. Didn't know much about her health, really. Papa was strong as an ox until the day he passed, never seemed sick a day in his life. I had one brother, but we didn’t see much of each other. He went out west, and I don’t know nothin’ about his health either. My daughter, bless her heart, she's healthy as a horse, far as I know. Never had much trouble with anythin’. Seems like we're all pretty lucky, or were lucky. I don't recall anyone havin' those troubles you mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history available, then. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis. The doctor gave it to me a few years back, somethin' to help with the achin'. It's a little white pill… I can't recall the name of it for the life of me. I take one every mornin'. And sometimes, when my hands are really bad, I'll take a little somethin’ for the pain, but not every day. Mostly, I just rub 'em with a little liniment. And… oh! Sometimes I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, 'cause I don’t get out in the sun much. That's about it. I try not to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D and something for arthritis… Let's see if we can pinpoint the arthritis medication. Do you recall where you obtained it?
PATIENT: I got it from Dr. Abernathy, back in Stilwell, like I said. He prescribed it when my hands started gettin' real bad, made it hard to knead dough. It came in a little orange bottle. That's all I remember. I've been gettin' it refilled at the pharmacy in town ever since, but I don't bother readin’ the label. My daughter usually handles all that for me. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see here you’ve been prescribed naproxen 500mg. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Naproxen… that sounds right. Yes, that’s it! Naproxen. As for allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I can eat anything, thankfully. Love a good pecan pie, though pecans sometimes give my stomach a little trouble if I eat too many. But that's not an allergy, just… a consequence of enjoyin' life, I reckon. I’ve never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy or anythin’ like that either. Pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Steines, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and feel your joints. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to bein’ poked and prodded. Just try not to bend my fingers too much, they get stiff real easy. And don't be surprised if I start talkin’ about pie crusts mid-exam, it’s a habit. I just want to get back to bakin' before the weather gets too hot. Pecans are best when harvested in August, you know.
DOCTOR: Pie crusts are a worthy topic, indeed. And pecans in August, you are absolutely right. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 162 over 94. A bit elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Let’s check those joints now. Knees exhibit mild crepitus and some tenderness to palpation. Hands show some mild swelling and bony prominence consistent with osteoarthritis. Range of motion is limited due to pain. Alright, Ms. Steines. Everything appears consistent with your reported symptoms.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound too good, does it? Murmur… and crepitus… I reckon my old body's just wearin' out. I've had a good run, though. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Do I gotta stop bakin’? Because that just ain’t an option. And will I have to take a whole passel of pills now? I don't want to be one of those folks who rattle when they walk.
DOCTOR: Now, let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Steines. A murmur doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, and we'll need to investigate further to determine its cause. The crepitus in your knees is expected with osteoarthritis. As for bakin', I’m not saying you have to stop! However, uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious complications – stroke, heart attack, kidney problems. And we do need to get that under control. First, I want to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your heart function. We should also get a chest x-ray to evaluate your lungs. And I'd like to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week with a home blood pressure monitor. As for medication, let's hold off on starting anything immediately. We'll review the blood work results and see how consistent your blood pressure readings are before making any decisions. It’s possible we can manage this with lifestyle modifications initially – diet, exercise, stress reduction. We can discuss a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation of that murmur, but that's something we can consider after we have more information. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a whole heap of tests. Blood work… EKG… chest x-ray… It sounds like I’m fallin' apart! But alright, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A home blood pressure monitor… Now, how am I gonna work that thing? I barely know how to work the microwave! And diet… I am careful about my sugar, for the pies, but I do love a good biscuit with butter. And exercise… Well, bakin' is exercise, isn't it? But alright. I’ll try. I’ll get my daughter to help me with the monitor and the tests. And I’ll see if I can cut back on the biscuits. Just don't make me stop bakin’ altogether. Promise? Because those pecans won't harvest themselves, you know. And people are expectin' my pies for the county fair. It's a matter of honor!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. No promises to stop the bakin'! That's completely unrealistic and, frankly, undesirable. We'll work around the bakin’. And we'll get your daughter involved – that's a great idea. I'll write you a prescription for the home blood pressure monitor, and I’ll have the nurse give you a demonstration before you leave. She's very patient. As for the tests, we'll get those ordered right away. We’ll have you scheduled at the lab here in town. I'll also print out some information on lifestyle modifications – a healthy diet for blood pressure control, some gentle exercises you can try, and stress management techniques. We’ll review the results together in about a week. We'll focus on small, manageable changes, and we'll see what we can achieve. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Well, that's mighty kind of you, Doctor. And I appreciate the nurse's patience, bless her heart. I'm a bit slow sometimes, you know. Let me see… gentle exercises… I suppose I could walk around the garden a bit more. And stress… Well, bakin’ relieves stress, doesn’t it? Emergency room… That sounds scary. But alright, I’ll remember. Chest pain… shortness of breath… Um… I guess my only question is… will this affect my pie crusts? Will I have to change the recipe? Because my family would revolt if I started messin’ with Grandma’s pie crust recipe. It's a sacred trust, you know. It's been passed down for generations! It's got a special blend of flour and shortening... it’s very delicate.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Steines. This will absolutely not affect your pie crusts. Grandma's recipe is safe. We’re focusing on your overall health, not on altering a perfect pie crust. A little extra walking and a few dietary tweaks won't change a thing about your bakin’. Believe me, I understand the importance of family traditions. The goal is to keep you healthy so you can continue bakin' those pies for many years to come. We'll manage your blood pressure and any other concerns around your lifestyle, not by trying to change it completely. Now, I’m going to have the nurse schedule your lab work and demonstrate the blood pressure monitor. Do you have any other questions or concerns before she comes in?
PATIENT: Oh, good! That’s a weight off my mind. Grandma would be rollin’ in her grave if I messed with that recipe. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old woman who barely knows what’s goin’ on. And tell the nurse I appreciate her help too. I reckon I best get home and tell my daughter to prepare for a whole heap of tests. And maybe practice walkin' around the garden. But I’m still bakin' those pies, right? Just promise me that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. You are most certainly still bakin’ those pies. That is non-negotiable. And you're very welcome. I’m glad I could reassure you. Now, let's get the nurse in here. She’ll take it from here, and she’ll make sure you have everything you need. Nurse, could you please assist Ms. Steines with scheduling her lab work and demonstrate the use of the home blood pressure monitor?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You have a lovely day, Ms. Steines. And remember, keep bakin’ those pies!
