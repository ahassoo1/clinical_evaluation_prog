DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: That's right. Arbie Rowbottom. And don't you forget it. I don’t repeat myself often.
DOCTOR: Well, I certainly try not to. But at my age, things do… slip. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's… well, it's embarrassing, really. But I saw… blood. In the stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to worry a man. Especially a man of my… standing.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool. Right. It is good you're getting it checked out. And "standing" isn’t really relevant medically, but alright. How long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you get smart with me, young lady. It’s been… a couple of times now. Maybe three? It's hard to say, honestly. I don’t spend that much time looking at it, if you catch my drift. It started… oh, maybe a week ago? Give or take.
DOCTOR: A week, roughly. And was it bright red blood, dark blood, or… something else?
PATIENT: Bright red, I think. Yes, definitely bright red. Like… well, you know. Fresh. Not all… murky or anything. And it wasn't every time, like I said. Mostly just… a streak, here and there. Not enough to cause a panic, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, "changes"? I go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it's… not. Old age, you know? Everything slows down. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily everything. Have you been more constipated than usual?
PATIENT: Consti… what now? Look, I haven't been blocked up, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… regular. Maybe a little harder to… push sometimes. That's all. But I wouldn't say I'm “consti-pated”. It's a perfectly normal part of getting older!
DOCTOR: Right. Normal. And any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating associated with this?
PATIENT: Well, my stomach does grumble sometimes. Doesn't everyone's? And a bit of a ache now and then, but I’m 88 years old! What do you expect? It’s not like it’s sharp pain, mind you. Just… old man aches. I’ve had a good life, plenty of flying. Maybe it’s just settling.
DOCTOR: Flying?
PATIENT: Yes, flying! I was a pilot, you know. For a long time. Airline pilot. Copilot, flight engineer… I’ve seen a thing or two. Spent years up in the air. Best job a man could have. Though, I suppose all that turbulence couldn't have been good for my insides.
DOCTOR: Turbulence. Alright. Let's get a quick look at you, then. Just a basic exam. I want to check your abdomen and do a quick digital rectal exam, if you don’t mind. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: A… a what now? You want to… poke around there? Honestly! At my age? Is that absolutely necessary? I’m telling you, it's just old man aches. I’d rather not, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, it is necessary. Blood in the stool requires investigation, and a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of that process. It helps us rule out more serious issues. It’s not about your age, it’s about proper medical care. I understand it’s uncomfortable, but it’s very quick. We can proceed or, frankly, I can’t help you further. It's your choice, of course. But I strongly advise it.
PATIENT: Honestly… young people these days. No respect for privacy. Fine. Fine. But don't go poking around too much. And be gentle. I’m a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Just a quick exam. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. I’ll let you know what I find.
PATIENT: This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. A man of my standing… being examined like this. Hmph. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I didn't feel any obvious masses, but there was some tenderness on the left side. Your prostate feels normal size, but also a bit tender. And I did notice a small amount of…melena. Dark, tarry stool on the glove. I’ll need to send a stool sample to the lab to confirm, and I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Melena? What in the world is melena? And tenderness? It’s probably just…sitting wrong. As for allergies… hmm. I think I had a bit of a rash once from some… penicillin, maybe? A long time ago. I don’t really remember. It wasn’t serious. Just a little itchy.
DOCTOR: Alright, penicillin allergy noted. Melena indicates bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. The tenderness and the melena are concerning. I’m also going to order a colonoscopy. It's the best way to visualize the colon and identify the source of the bleeding. I know it’s not pleasant, but it’s important. Do you have a family history of colon cancer or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy?! Now you're just trying to scare an old man. I thought you just said it was probably sitting wrong! A colonoscopy sounds… invasive. And painful. I don’t need any of that. My father… he had indigestion. Terrible indigestion. That’s about it. And my mother… well, she worried a lot. But no cancer or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns, but we need to rule out anything serious. While indigestion is possible, the bleeding and tenderness warrant further investigation. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis. It is invasive, yes, but it’s generally safe and we’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. The prep is the worst part. And frankly, ignoring this could have serious consequences. Are you on any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, it’s probably just old age! And all that flying. Turbulence, you know? Shakes everything up. I take… a little bit of aspirin now and then for my knees. And sometimes a Tums if I eat something spicy. That's it! Just a little aspirin! Is that going to cause all this trouble? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, even low-dose, can contribute to bleeding. We need to get a handle on this. Because of the bleeding, the aspirin needs to stop immediately. I’m going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They will schedule the colonoscopy and discuss the procedure with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or significant rectal bleeding, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room?! Now you are trying to scare me. Fine. Fine! I’ll see your… gastroenterologist. But I still think it’s just old age. And turbulence. Don't expect me to be happy about this. Write your little note. But I’m telling you, this is all a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Right. Here's the referral. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment. And Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, I’m doing this for your health. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. I'll also send the lab results to your doctor as soon as they come back. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… a waste of time. And a lot of unnecessary poking around. But…thank you, I suppose. Though I don’t see how this will help. Hmph. .
