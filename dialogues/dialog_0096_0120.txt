DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. Forty-three, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get straight to it… I want to make sure everything's… you know… working, if I decide to try again. It was a whole thing with my husband, and I don’t want any surprises this time.
DOCTOR: “Working,” you say. Right. Well, a lot goes into that, dear. "Surprises" aren’t usually a matter of just hoping for the best. It's a bit… vague, what you’re telling me. Are you experiencing any difficulties currently?
PATIENT: Difficulties? No, not… exactly. It’s just… well, I’m not getting any younger, are you with me? And things weren’t… ideal last time. I don't want a repeat, obviously. Is that clear enough? I just want to be sure before I… you know… get my hopes up. It's a sensitive subject, really.
DOCTOR: Sensitive, yes. Well, most things are these days. So, let’s be clear. You’re concerned about your ability to conceive again, given a previous… unfavorable experience. And you want a general check-up to assess your reproductive health before attempting pregnancy. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… good. Yes, exactly. Look, I had private insurance, so I expect a thorough check-up, alright? Not just… asking questions. I want to know what’s going on. And honestly, I don’t remember all the details from before, it was a difficult time. So, you’ll have to do most of the work, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. A thorough check-up. Naturally. We'll start with a medical history, and then we’ll move onto a physical exam. It helps me to understand what happened previously, even if you don’t recall all the specifics. Now, let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not that I remember. I was pretty healthy, always have been. My husband… he was the one with the problems, always going to doctors. I mostly just kept the house running. And honestly, after… well, I didn't really want to think about doctors for a long time. Is there a quick test we can just do to see if everything's alright?
DOCTOR: “Quick tests” aren’t always… reliable, dear. And simply being “healthy” isn’t enough to guarantee everything is functioning optimally. We need to be systematic. Alright. No major illnesses. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And… oh! I had a C-section with… with my husband's child. That was… necessary, of course. Everything went fine, as far as I know. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: A C-section, yes. That's important information. Do you recall any complications during or after the C-section?
PATIENT: Complications? Not really. Everything was… standard, I suppose. They stitched me up, I recovered, and… well, things went on. It was a blur, honestly. I wasn't the focus, you know? My husband... he was always the one needing attention. I just wanted it to be over with.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even if it felt like a blur, complications, however minor, can still have lasting effects. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, reproductive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history? My mother had… something with her blood pressure, I think. And my aunt… she had cancer, but a long time ago. Everyone on my mother's side seemed pretty healthy, actually. Lots of strong women. My husband’s family… that’s a whole different story. Lots of… problems. Honestly, I don't even like thinking about them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some blood pressure issues and a distant cancer diagnosis. Not terribly helpful, but we're noting it. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My husband tried it once, but I made him stop immediately. No, definitely not a smoker. Anything else? I really do need to get back to things, you know.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. A small glass, maybe two on special occasions. I'm not a drinker, not really. It just… helps me relax sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I try to stay natural, you know? I don’t believe in filling my body with all those chemicals. I might take a vitamin C tablet if I'm feeling a cold coming on, but that’s about it. Really, I’m very healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Very well. Now, despite your assertions of being "very healthy," we do need to proceed with a physical exam to get a clearer picture. It's standard procedure. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a pelvic exam. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh… Honestly, I hadn’t thought that far ahead. Is it… necessary? I mean, I just want to know if I’m likely to have problems, not a whole… investigation. But, if you insist. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try to be gentle. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, dear. A thorough examination is crucial. I assure you, I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Please undress from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I’ll be right back with the necessary equipment.
PATIENT: .
