DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore… it just won't heal. Honestly, I’ve been dealing with it for… oh, a good while now. Longer than it should, I suspect. It’s a bother, truly.
DOCTOR: A “good while” isn’t terribly helpful, I’m afraid. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get snippy with me, young lady. It's been… let me think. Since last October, I believe. Right after the church picnic. Yes, October the 14th. I remember because old Man Hemmings spilled punch all down Mrs. Kabua’s new dress. A dreadful mess. And that's when I first noticed it, a little ache. Now it’s… well, look at it. It’s hardly dignified.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Honestly, you make it sound like it’s my fault it's taking so long. I’ve always taken good care of myself. But alright. Just… be gentle. And try not to poke too much. My skin is delicate, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see it. There's some redness and… some breakdown of the skin. And it appears quite tender, even with gentle touch. Is it constantly painful, or is it more when you put weight on it?
PATIENT: Constantly painful, dear. Not a sharp pain, mind you, more of a dull ache that just… is. Gets worse if I'm on my feet for too long, naturally. I try not to stand much these days. Makes it very difficult to do my work, though. I have specimens to look at, you know. Important work, really. Can’t have that delayed because of a little sore.
DOCTOR: Specimens?
PATIENT: Yes, specimens! I'm a scientist. Well, retired now, but I was a medical scientist. I worked with… various things. Tissue samples, mostly. Very important research, it was. Though they don’t appreciate proper science like they used to. Too much focus on… well, never mind. The point is, I need to be able to get around! I can’t be laid up with a foot sore. It's simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. Let’s try to get this sorted. Do you have any diabetes, or any other medical conditions that might affect healing?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness, no. Never had a speck of sugar pass my lips unless it was in a proper fruit. Though... Doctor Alika mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high at my check-up last year. Said I needed to “watch it”. I told him I eat perfectly healthy. I grow most of my own vegetables, you know. It's the best quality. I suspect he was just trying to sell me something.
DOCTOR: The chart does indicate a slightly elevated A1C from last year, as well as some notes about peripheral neuropathy. It appears Dr. Alika did recommend monitoring. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Just my usual vitamins, dear. A good multi-vitamin, and a little fish oil for the joints. Nothing fancy. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless it’s absolutely necessary. They just mask the real problem, you know? And frankly, I suspect half of them don’t even do anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… well, I always get a bit of a rash if I touch those oleander bushes. Nasty things, oleanders. And I’m not fond of mangoes, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Otherwise, no. Perfectly healthy, as far as I’m concerned. It's just this foot! Honestly, it's baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your pulses in your feet. And then we’ll discuss some potential causes and, hopefully, a plan.
PATIENT: Honestly, poking and prodding won’t solve anything. But fine. Get on with it. Just be careful, young lady. My bones are rather brittle, you know. Age has a way of doing that to a person. And do try to explain things in a way that doesn’t involve too much… jargon. I’m a scientist, not a magician.
DOCTOR: The pulses in your foot are a bit weak. This, combined with the elevated blood sugar and the neuropathy notes from Dr. Alika, suggests the possibility of peripheral artery disease, which can reduce blood flow to your foot and hinder healing. The rash is likely contact dermatitis from the oleander. It's important to keep that area clean. It seems like you've developed a foot ulcer, and the reduced circulation is likely contributing to the slow healing. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Peripheral artery what? Honestly, you’re just throwing words at me now. Reduced circulation… so you’re saying I’m not getting enough blood to my foot? That sounds rather… alarming. And contact dermatitis? From a bush? I haven't even been near an oleander bush in months! This all sounds… needlessly complicated. Can’t you just give me something to heal it? A cream, perhaps? Something simple?
DOCTOR: A cream isn’t going to resolve the underlying problem, Ms. Cannington. We need to determine why your foot isn’t healing. A simple cream would be akin to putting a bandage on a broken bone. It won’t fix it. We’re going to need to order some tests. A vascular study to assess the blood flow to your foot, and a wound culture to check for infection. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a podiatrist for specialized wound care.
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? And a podiatrist? What's wrong with a regular doctor? This sounds terribly… invasive. And expensive, I suspect. Honestly, I think I'll get a second opinion. Dr. Alika always was a sensible man. I’m not sure I like all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your hesitation, but delaying proper diagnosis and treatment could lead to serious complications, potentially even amputation. A podiatrist specializes in foot care, and their expertise is crucial in cases like yours. The vascular study is non-invasive; it uses ultrasound to assess blood flow. I strongly recommend we proceed with these tests. I’m not suggesting Dr. Alika isn't a fine physician, but this requires specialized attention. Would you like me to go over the potential risks of not pursuing these tests?
PATIENT: Amputation?! Oh, my goodness! You mean… cutting off my foot?! Now you’re just trying to frighten me. That’s… outrageous! I’ve lived a long and productive life, and I certainly don’t intend to lose a limb over a little sore. No, absolutely not. No tests, no podiatrists, and certainly no talk of… amputation. I think I’ll just go home and put some Epsom salts in the tub. That’s what my mother always did.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I cannot, in good conscience, allow you to forgo proper medical care based on a home remedy. While Epsom salts may provide temporary relief, they will not address the underlying cause of your non-healing ulcer. I strongly urge you to reconsider. If you refuse these tests, I must document your refusal and advise you to seek care elsewhere. I am concerned about your well-being, and I believe you require specialized attention. I’m not trying to frighten you, but this is a serious matter.
