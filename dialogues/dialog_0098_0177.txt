DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... something down there. A little leak, you know? Been happenin' a bit. Not sure what to do about it. It's kinda embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a bit uncomfortable to talk about, but you’ve come to the right place. When you say “down there”, are you referring to vaginal leaking?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh... no, no. Not there. Down there. You know… for a man. My… friend. He's been havin' it. I brought him, but he’s shy. Real shy. He just… feels it. And it smells funny.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. You’ve brought your friend in today. I apologize for the misunderstanding. So, your friend is experiencing some leaking and odor. Could you tell me a little more about when he first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been… a while. Maybe a month? Hard to say, he doesn't really say things. Just kinda grumbles. He's always been a quiet one. And it comes and goes. Not always there, you know? Sometimes after… well, you know. After things. But not always. It's confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been approximately a month, intermittent, and seems to be associated with… sexual activity. Is he experiencing any pain or burning when he urinates?
PATIENT: Urinates? Oh, I don't know about that. He doesn't complain about peein'. He just… gets real quiet and embarrassed. Like now. He's hidin' behind me. You know, men. Always think it's somethin' terrible if they gotta go to the doctor. Like they're broken or somethin'. He just wants it to stop. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for men to be hesitant about seeking medical attention. Alright, so no pain or burning with urination. Has he noticed any other changes, like a rash, sores, or discharge besides the leaking?
PATIENT: Discharge? Oh, yeah. That's what I meant. It's kinda… yellowish, I think. And it smells. Like… old fish. Not a nice smell, I tell ya. He tries to keep it clean, but… you know. It's hard for him. He's not very… nimble anymore. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge with an odor described as “old fish,” and difficulty with hygiene. Has he had any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I know of. He doesn't tell me much. He mostly just sits and watches TV. He gets a little tired sometimes, but he's old! Everyone gets tired when they get old. He ain’t been sick, though. Just… this. This embarrassing problem. He just wants it to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like this has been quite concerning for both of you. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This would involve a visual inspection and possibly a gentle palpation of the area. Would that be alright with him?
PATIENT: Oh. An examination? He's gonna hate that. He really hates being touched. You gotta be real gentle, okay? And quick. He gets real flustered. And don't say nothin' embarrassing! He gets red all over. I'll… I'll hold his hand. That usually helps. Just… be quick, please?
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. I’ll also move as quickly as I can. And you are welcome to hold his hand – that’s a good idea. I want to assure him—and you—that this is a safe space, and we're just trying to figure out what’s causing this so we can get him feeling better. Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Well, is it serious? Is it somethin'… bad? He worries about bad things. He watches a lot of TV, and they always say it's somethin' terrible. And will it… spread? I don’t want him givin' it to anyone.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns. It's difficult to say exactly what’s going on without a proper examination, but the symptoms you’ve described could indicate an infection, or another treatable condition. It’s unlikely to be “terrible,” but it is important to get it checked out. As for spreading, that depends on the cause. Some conditions are easily treated and not contagious, while others require both of you to be treated. That’s why determining the cause is so important. We'll do our best to find out what's going on and discuss the appropriate treatment options. Would you like me to explain the exam process quickly before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay...treatable is good. That's good. Explain it, please. He gets real jumpy if he doesn't know what's happenin'. Just tell me what you're gonna do, and I'll tell him. And be gentle, remember? Real gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I will need to visually inspect the area. I'll be looking for any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge. I will also gently palpate the area – that means I’ll be feeling around to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. The whole process should only take a few minutes. I will use gloves, and I’ll explain each step before I do it. If at any point he feels uncomfortable, he should let me know immediately, and we can stop. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Gloves are good. He likes gloves. And explainin' is good. Okay... I guess so. He's still hidin' behind me, grumblin'. But he lets me hold his hand. Just... don't take too long, okay? And be gentle. You already said that, but... really gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise. Okay, if you're both ready, could he please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: He’s… he’s kinda stuck. He doesn’t like lyin’ down. Makes him feel… vulnerable, he says. Can’t you just… look? Without him havin’ to lie down?
DOCTOR: Of course. We can definitely start with a standing examination. It’s important that he feels comfortable. Would he prefer to remain seated, then?
PATIENT: Seated is better. Much better. He's a little shaky, though. Gotta hold onto somethin'. That chair looks kinda wobbly.
DOCTOR: Alright. If he’d like, he can lean forward a little, and I’ll examine the area while he’s seated. I’ll just need to gently pull down his pants slightly to get a better look. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Pants? Oh… he’s gonna hate that. He’s real modest. Can’t you just… look around? Without takin’ his pants off?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can start by just looking around without lowering his pants. It might be more difficult to get a full assessment this way, but it's important that he feels safe and comfortable. I will need to gently lift the fabric around the area to get a better view. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Liftin' the fabric… yeah, that’s okay. Just… be quick. And don't stare! He gets real embarrassed if people stare. And don’t say nothin’ about it bein’… small. He’s real sensitive about that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as quick and respectful as possible, and I will not stare or make any comments about his anatomy. I am simply trying to determine the cause of the issue. If you are ready, I’ll gently lift the fabric around the area and take a look. Please let me know if he feels uncomfortable at any point. I'm observing some mild redness and a small amount of yellowish discharge. There doesn't appear to be any obvious swelling or sores. I will gently palpate the area now to check for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Palpate? Oh… he’s flinchin’. Real flinchin’. Just… be real gentle, okay? He doesn’t like bein’ touched. It hurts, he says. Even when it doesn’t.
DOCTOR: I apologize. I can see that's causing him discomfort. I will refrain from further palpation at this time. Given his sensitivity and discomfort, it’s difficult to get a complete assessment. Based on what I've observed, I suspect this may be a case of balanitis – an inflammation of the head of the penis – or a possible sexually transmitted infection. However, to confirm this, we really need to do some tests. Would he be willing to allow me to collect a urine sample and a swab from the affected area?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh… he’s gonna hate that. Swabs and… pee? He doesn’t like givin’ samples. He says it’s… personal. Can’t you just… give him somethin’ for it? A cream or somethin’? Without all the pokin’ and proddin’? He’s an old man, Doctor. He just wants it to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s important that he feels comfortable, and I wouldn’t want to do anything that makes him feel violated. I can prescribe a topical antifungal cream to start with, which may help if it is balanitis. However, without knowing the cause, we can’t be sure if this is the right treatment. If it’s a sexually transmitted infection, the cream won’t be effective, and it could even make things worse. Would he be willing to consider visiting a specialist, perhaps a urologist, who is more experienced in dealing with these types of sensitive issues?
PATIENT: A… specialist? Oh, goodness. He hates specialists. Too many doctors. Too many tests. Too much pokin’ and proddin’. He just wants it to go away, Doctor. Can’t you just… give him somethin’ strong? A really strong cream? And tell him it’s gonna be alright? He gets real worried, you know. He watches a lot of TV. They always say it’s somethin’ terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand his concerns. I can prescribe a stronger topical antifungal cream, which may provide some relief. However, I must emphasize that this is not a substitute for a proper diagnosis. If his symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, it’s crucial that he see a specialist. And I will write a note stating that I recommend further evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions. I can also give him some information about sexually transmitted infections, just in case, and explain the importance of safe practices. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Information... and a strong cream? Yeah, that's okay. As long as it doesn't involve too much pokin' and proddin'. He's a very sensitive man, Doctor. Very sensitive. And tell him it's probably nothin' serious. Just… old age, you know? Okay. That’ll do. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Genard. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I'll have the nurse prepare the prescription and some informational pamphlets for you. Please, if his symptoms persist or worsen, don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment or seek care from a specialist. I wish you both all the best. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. We’ll be goin’ now. And tell him… tell him not to worry so much. It’s probably just old age. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Genard. And please, encourage him to take care of himself.
