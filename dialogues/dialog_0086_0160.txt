DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh, welcome. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to sit here explaining things. It’s this tiredness, this…weakness. It’s getting worse. And it’s… embarrassing, but I’ve been craving dirt. Actual dirt, you know? Like, from the garden. Don’t look at me like that, it’s not normal, I know that’s not normal. But I can’t seem to stop.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "not normal" is a good starting point, thankfully. Craving dirt… that is unusual. And you said this tiredness and weakness is getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Yes, it is! It started a few months back, just feeling a little run down. Thought it was just getting older, you know? But now... now I can barely get through the day without needing a nap. And this dirt thing started around the same time. It’s just… a feeling. A need. It’s awful. I try to ignore it, but it doesn't work. It's like... my body wants it. What could possibly be causing this?
DOCTOR: Alright. And you've noticed this coincides with the fatigue, you said. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, my stomach hasn’t been right. A bit… upset. Not diarrhea or anything, just… queasy. And I’ve been feeling colder than usual, even when it's warm out. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Just old age catching up with me. I don't want to waste your time with a bunch of little aches and pains. It’s this tiredness and the dirt that’s the real problem.
DOCTOR: "Just old age" can still be something, Ms. Hardenburgh. We need to investigate. You mentioned stomach upset and feeling cold... has your appetite changed at all?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. Not a huge amount, mind you, but I eat. I've always been a small eater. Though… now that you mention it, I haven’t been enjoying my food as much lately. Everything tastes… bland. Like there's no flavor. But I still eat, just because I know I should. Is this going somewhere, Doctor? I really don't have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you've been eating normally, despite the lack of enjoyment?
PATIENT: Yes, I just told you! I eat. Regular portions, mostly. I make myself. I don’t starve myself, if that’s what you’re thinking. Look, I understand you have to ask questions, but are we getting anywhere with this? This dirt craving is just… humiliating. And the tiredness is debilitating. I need to know why this is happening, and what can be done about it. I haven’t got time for endless questioning.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. We are getting somewhere. It's just... these things take time. Now, let’s go through some basic history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty… simple, really. No fancy foods, no special creams, no medications unless absolutely necessary. I avoid doctors if I can, truthfully. They never seem to find anything wrong. This dirt thing is just… bizarre. I haven’t been sick, haven’t traveled anywhere, just… this. Honestly, it feels like I’m losing my mind. Can we please just skip the endless questions and get to a solution?
DOCTOR: Alright. Past medical history – any significant illnesses, surgeries, hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I've been incredibly lucky, if you want to know the truth. Never broken a bone, never had a serious illness. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing a good rest couldn’t cure. I take care of myself, I do. I eat healthy, I get enough sleep… well, used to get enough sleep. This whole thing is just so… unlike me. It's frightening, honestly. Are you writing all this down? Because frankly, it's not adding up. A healthy 79-year-old woman craving dirt? It sounds ridiculous even saying it. Can we just run some tests? Please?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Ms. Hardenburgh. And yes, it’s… unusual. Now, family history - any history of anemia, digestive problems, or unusual cravings in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Family history? You’re going to ask about my family now? My mother was a perfectly healthy woman, lived to be 85. My father the same. No strange illnesses, no anemia, nothing. They were… normal people. Look, I’m telling you, this is something new. Something wrong with me. Digging into my family history isn’t going to magically cure my dirt craving, is it? Can we please just get to the tests? I have errands to run. This is wasting my whole day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration, but I need to gather a complete history to determine the best course of action. It's not about "magically curing" anything; it's about ruling out potential causes. Now, social history - do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I live alone! Perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you very much. Always have, always will. Don't need anyone fussing over me. I have my routines, I have my garden… I had a nice garden, before this whole dirt craving started. It’s embarrassing, you know? Having to hide it from the neighbors. They already think I'm a bit eccentric. Can we finally move on to something productive? Blood tests? Anything? I’m getting a headache, and frankly, I’m losing patience. I didn't come here to be interrogated, I came here to fix a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get to the physical exam then. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. I'll also take a look at your fingernails. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Finally. Good. Let's just get it over with. Honestly, this whole experience is just dreadful. I’m not exactly built for acrobatics anymore. Just… get on with it, please. The sooner this is over, the better. And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath... okay. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. This will involve pressing on your stomach. Let me know if you experience any pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just… uncomfortable. My stomach hasn't been right, like I said. Just a bit… queasy. It's hard to explain. Not sharp pain, just… unsettled. And honestly, I’m not thrilled about someone poking around in there. It feels… intrusive. Can we hurry this along? I have things to do, you know. This is taking up my entire afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant masses or tenderness noted. Now, let's check your reflexes. And the other side… Good. Now, I’m going to take a look at your fingernails. Your nails appear slightly pale… and I see some mild ridging. We'll need to run some tests to investigate further. I'm ordering a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also check your vitamin D levels.
PATIENT: Tests, finally. Good. I knew something wasn’t right. What exactly are you looking for? Is it… serious? Don't tell me it's something awful. I’ve lived a long life, you know, I don’t need any unpleasant surprises now. Just tell me straight, Doctor. What are we dealing with here? And how long will these tests take? I really can’t afford to be laid up for weeks. Honestly, this whole ordeal is just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Ms. Hardenburgh. The pale nails and fatigue, along with the dirt craving, suggest a possible iron deficiency anemia. The blood tests will confirm this, and we’ll rule out other causes. The vitamin D test is standard, as deficiencies can contribute to fatigue. As for the dirt craving – that's known as pica, and can sometimes be linked to nutritional deficiencies, though it can have other causes as well. The tests should be processed within 48-72 hours. Once the results are in, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. It’s unlikely you’ll be “laid up for weeks,” but depending on the results, you may need iron supplements and dietary changes. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies! Absolutely none. Look, Doctor, can you just… be straightforward with me? Is this serious? Is it something I need to worry about? I’m not a child, I can handle the truth. This pica…is it common? And is it…contagious? I don't want to be a burden on anyone, and I certainly don't want anyone thinking I'm… strange. Honestly, this whole thing is just dreadful. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Should I be eating more of something? Less of something? Just tell me what to do!
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, it’s understandable that you’re anxious. Pica, while not common, isn’t necessarily a sign of something dire. It often indicates a nutritional deficiency, as I mentioned. The blood tests will pinpoint if that’s the case. In the meantime, don’t drastically change your diet. Continue eating a balanced diet, as you’ve been doing. And please do not actively seek out dirt to eat. That could introduce harmful bacteria. We need to determine the underlying cause first. While we await the results, try to rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. I know this is unsettling, but we’re taking the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. Once we have the blood work back, we’ll have a clearer picture and can discuss treatment options. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... try to be quick about it, please. I don't want to be stuck waiting around for weeks. And please, no more poking around. Honestly, this whole ordeal is just dreadful. Is there anything else I need to do? Any paperwork? Any forms? I really just want to get this over with. And… can you tell me when I can expect a call? A specific time? I have errands to run, you know, and I need to plan my schedule. This whole ordeal is just... unsettling. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve got a consent form for the blood work here. Just initial and sign at the bottom. You should receive a call within 48 hours with the results. If you haven't heard anything by then, please don't hesitate to call the office. The lab usually processes them quickly. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when we have the results. Any other questions before you leave?
