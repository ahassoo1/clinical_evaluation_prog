DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn't feel like… a bad headache, like when I was younger. More… a pressure. And sometimes… it feels a little bit in my neck too. Not much, but it goes together. I work with the trains, you see. Maybe that… maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a pressure than a sharp pain, and it sometimes extends into your neck. And you work with the trains – that's good to know. Could you tell me a bit about the work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I work with the… the big trains. I move them, you see? I drive the little trains to move the big ones when they need help. And… and I make sure they are all lined up right. Been doing it a long time. Maybe sixty years! It’s… it’s hard work, sometimes. Lots of… shaking and bumping. And I have to look up a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, sixty years is a long time! That’s impressive. So, a lot of shaking, bumping, and looking up. Does anything specific seem to trigger the headache – like, does it happen more after a long shift, or when you're looking up for a particularly long time?
PATIENT: Yes, I think… yes, it's worse after a long day. When I finish work, and I sit down… that’s when it really starts. And… when I have to look up for a long time… to check the lines… it gets bad then too. It’s not every time, but… most times. Is that what you mean, “trigger”? I don’t know all the words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean by “trigger” – things that seem to bring it on or make it worse. Okay, so it sounds like a long shift and looking up are both triggers. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… no. No dizziness. No… blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Just… the headache. And sometimes a little stiff in my neck. But not always. Is important to say, I am very old. Maybe this is just… old age?
DOCTOR: You're right to mention you're very old, Mitchell, and it’s important to consider everything. It’s good that you haven’t had dizziness or blurry vision. Just the headache and occasional neck stiffness. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you’ve been a patient here for a while. No major medical issues listed, just some routine checkups. Have you had any recent injuries, even small ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No injuries. Not recently. I… I bumped my head a long time ago, when I was a young man. Working on the trains, you know? But that was… sixty years ago? More? Is not important, I think. Everything is okay now. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bump to the head a long time ago, but nothing recent. Good to know. Alright, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your neck and some basic neurological things – reflexes, balance, that sort of thing. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my neck, please. It gets sore easily. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mitchell. I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m just feeling along your neck muscles here. They do feel a little tight on both sides, as you mentioned. No major tenderness, though. Now, I’m going to have you look up, down, left, and right… Good. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much. Just a little bit of… stiffness. Like I said. It’s not… a sharp pain. Just… tight. I can look up, down, left, and right… but it doesn’t feel good. Maybe a little bit when I look up… but not bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, and I’m going to check your reflexes now… Checks reflexes. Those seem normal on both sides. Now, let’s just check your balance… Guides Mitchell through a simple balance test. You seem steady enough. Okay, Mitchell. Everything seems pretty normal, but the neck tightness and the fact that it’s worse after work and when looking up is important. It sounds like this could be a tension headache, possibly aggravated by your work. It’s also good we ruled out anything more serious with the exam.
PATIENT: Tension headache? Is that bad, Doctor? Will I… will I have to stop working? I need the work. I have no insurance, you see. And I am old. I cannot just… stop.
DOCTOR: No, Mitchell, a tension headache is not usually serious. It’s very common. And no, you shouldn’t have to stop working. We just need to manage it. It sounds like the repetitive motions and looking up for long periods are contributing factors. Let me see… I want to recommend some things. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help. But you shouldn’t take those every day for long periods. We can discuss that further. We can also look at some stretches and exercises you can do to help your neck muscles. And it's important to maintain good posture while working. Do you have any trouble getting pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can get them. The little store down the street. Is not… expensive. But I do not like to take too many pills. Makes me feel… weak. The stretches… I can try. But my wife… she used to help me with those. I… I am alone now. Is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. It’s perfectly reasonable not to want to take a lot of pills, and it’s completely understandable that it's harder now without your wife to help. Okay, let’s focus on stretches you can do on your own. I can print out some simple ones for you, with pictures. And I'm going to recommend keeping a log of when you get the headaches, what you were doing, and how long they last. This will help us understand what's triggering them. Here you go. These are pretty straightforward. Start slowly and don't push yourself too hard. Do you think you could try those, and keep the log?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can try. I will try very hard. The pictures… that helps. My eyes are not so good anymore. The log… yes, I will write down when it hurts. I always liked to write. My wife… she liked my writing too. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Is good to talk to someone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mitchell. I’m glad I could help. We’ll check in on how these are working in a couple of weeks. If the headaches get worse, or you start experiencing any new symptoms like dizziness, blurry vision, or weakness, please call the office right away. I’m also going to write a note to a local physical therapy clinic, just in case you decide you want some more personalized help with the stretches. It’s free to get information from them, and they might have some good suggestions. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be very kind. If they can help… that would be good. I… I am getting old, you know? Maybe I need some help. The writing… is good. I will write down the headaches, and I will try the stretches. And… and I will call if something is wrong. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. You are very good. I think I will go home now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mitchell. You take care of yourself. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Here’s the information about the physical therapy clinic, and the handout with the stretches. It was nice meeting you, Mitchell. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. Goodbye.
