DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...fine, I suppose. I’m here about some patches on my skin. They’re just… not right. They’ve been bothering me, and frankly, I expect a proper explanation.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not right” and wanting a proper explanation – that's perfectly reasonable. Can you tell me a little more about these patches?
PATIENT: Well, they’re…discolored. Not a nice color at all. Sort of a grayish-brown, and they’re a little rough to the touch. Not painful, exactly, but…unpleasant. They’ve been appearing over the last few months, slowly. Mostly on my arms and legs, though I think I saw one starting on my back yesterday. Honestly, I haven't been this closely examining myself until recently, but it’s concerning. I keep good skincare habits, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, grayish-brown, rough patches appearing over months, mostly on your arms and legs, and now possibly on your back. And you've noticed them recently despite having good skincare habits. That’s helpful information. When you say "appearing", do they start as very small spots and grow, or do they seem to just…show up as patches?
PATIENT: They don't really grow, no. More like…fade into existence. One day I don’t see anything, the next…there it is. A dull patch. It's very strange. And, honestly, I find it rather unsettling. It's not as if I spend my days in the sun, you know. I'm an archivist. I’m mostly indoors with…well, important things. Not getting tanned.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they don’t seem to be growing outwards, but rather just appearing. And you work as an archivist, spending most of your time indoors. That’s good to know. Have you noticed anything else associated with them?
PATIENT: Associated? What do you mean? Like...do they itch? No, thankfully. No pain, as I said. They don't feel different, exactly. Just…look wrong. I suppose...I've been a little more tired lately. But frankly, who isn't tired these days? It’s probably just the stress of the job, preserving history and dealing with…people. I don't think that's related, though. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching or pain, and you've been a bit more tired lately, but you don't think that's related. We’ll keep everything in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my husband keeps saying I’ve been a bit more…short with him. But honestly, he can be a bit oblivious sometimes. Apart from that…no, not really. I eat well, mostly traditional Ukrainian dishes, nothing too fancy. I’ve had no recent illnesses, no fevers, no…anything dramatic. I'm a very…stable person, Doctor. I don't usually have changes. It's these patches that are the odd thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're generally very stable health-wise, and these patches are the main concern. Traditional Ukrainian dishes, no recent illnesses, that’s helpful. Let's talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis, or anything else skin-related?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I've always had good skin. My grandmother always said it was the sour cream. And I’ve always taken very good care of myself. I've never had anything like…eczema or psoriasis. I mean, I've heard of those things, of course, but they’re for…other people. People who don't take care of themselves properly. No, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. And my Medicare covers everything, so I see the doctor regularly for checkups, and nothing has ever been mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of skin conditions and regular check-ups with nothing mentioned. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had my tonsils out when I was a child – a very long time ago – but that was it. A routine procedure. No hospital stays as an adult. I’m a remarkably healthy woman, Doctor. I find it rather insulting that you're asking these questions, frankly. It's these patches that are unusual, not a history of…illnesses. Really, it's quite baffling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Gabbrielle, and I apologize if my questions seem redundant given your history of good health. I ask these questions as a standard part of a medical evaluation to ensure I have a complete picture. I assure you, I'm listening to your concerns about the patches and we will figure this out. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have skin conditions?
PATIENT: Well, my babushka – that's my grandmother – she always had very sensitive skin. She used to say it was the cold winters in Ukraine. But she never had patches like these. Just…easily flushed. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, he has…rosacea, I think it’s called? It makes his face red. But that’s a completely different thing, isn’t it? Not these grayish-brown…anomalies. Honestly, I suspect it’s something I picked up at the archives. All those old documents…you never know what’s lurking in them.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitive skin in your grandmother and rosacea in your uncle. We'll make a note of that. And you suspect something from the archives – that's a possibility we can explore. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I believe in natural remedies whenever possible. And my husband always makes me take a multivitamin, but that’s the extent of it. He worries, you see. But I assure you, Doctor, I'm not one for filling myself with…chemicals. A bit of sour cream, a good night’s sleep, that’s all I need. These patches…they can't be due to anything I'm taking. It's just…baffling. Are you going to examine them, or are you going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Gabbrielle. I apologize for the lengthy questioning; I was trying to gather as much information as possible. Yes, let's examine them now. If you’ll just take a seat on the examination table, please. I’ll need to take a closer look at your arms and legs. And if you could please remove your sleeves, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Fine. But do be gentle. My skin is rather delicate, you know. And please, explain what you’re looking at, Doctor. I don't like being kept in the dark. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. These patches are slightly raised, and as you mentioned, they have a grayish-brown tone. The texture is rough, and they don't seem to be actively inflamed. I’m not seeing any scaling or blistering. They appear to be distributed somewhat randomly, and there doesn't seem to be any clear pattern. Based on what I’m seeing, and your history, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be a form of dermatitis, though the lack of inflammation is somewhat atypical. Another possibility is a fungal infection, although that usually presents with more itching. We should also rule out any underlying systemic causes, just to be safe. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have a skin scraping to check for fungal elements?
PATIENT: A skin scraping? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…barbaric. And “systemic causes”? What are you implying? Are you suggesting I have some…hidden illness? I suppose a small scraping wouldn't hurt, if it’s absolutely necessary. But I expect a full explanation of what you’re looking for. And I want to know what will happen if you do find something. I don’t want to be subjected to any unnecessary treatments. I trust you’re not one of those doctors who immediately jumps to prescribing medication for everything. And if it's just a fungus, I'm perfectly capable of treating it myself with tea tree oil. Honestly, this is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gabbrielle, and I apologize if I’ve caused you any alarm. A skin scraping is a very quick and relatively painless procedure. It simply involves gently removing a small sample of skin cells to be examined under a microscope. It will help us determine if a fungal infection is the cause of these patches. As for "systemic causes," I simply mean we want to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these skin changes. It’s standard practice, and it’s unlikely to be anything serious. And you are right to be cautious about unnecessary treatments. I always prioritize a conservative approach and will discuss all options with you before proceeding. If the skin scraping doesn’t reveal a fungus, we might consider a small skin biopsy – again, just to be thorough. This involves taking a tiny sample of skin for examination by a pathologist. But let's start with the scraping first. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain it. But make it quick. I have important documents to catalogue, you know. This is taking up valuable time. And please, be gentle. I do not tolerate unnecessary discomfort. And absolutely no needles. I have a…dislike of needles. A strong dislike.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No needles involved, I promise. This is a very superficial procedure. I'll gently scrape a small area of the patch with the scalpel – it feels a little like a mild scratch. It shouldn’t draw any blood, and it won’t require any anesthetic. I'll collect the sample on this swab, and then we'll send it to the lab for analysis. It typically takes a few days to get the results. See?
PATIENT: Hm. It doesn't look particularly pleasant. But…very well. Proceed. But if it hurts, I want you to stop immediately. And be quick about it, Doctor. This is already…trying my patience. And I expect a full explanation of the results, as soon as they’re available. I do not like to be kept in the dark. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: It was…unpleasant. And I trust you haven’t taken too much of my skin. It feels…sensitive now. Honestly, I'm not convinced this was necessary, but…very well. I suppose we’ll see what the results say. When can I expect them? And how will you inform me? I do not wish to have to chase you down. It's rather…disruptive to my schedule. Do you have my mobile number?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have your mobile number on file. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return the results. I will personally call you as soon as I have them. If I don't hear anything within a week, please don't hesitate to call the office and I will look into it for you. In the meantime, continue your normal skincare routine. Keep the bandage clean and dry. If you notice any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t suppose so. Just…call me as soon as you have the results. And don’t delay. I have important work to do, you know. And don’t suggest any…radical treatments. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. And if it turns out to be something…serious…well, I trust you’re competent enough to handle it. Very well. I suppose I’ll be going now. Thank you…Doctor. But frankly, I’m still rather unsettled. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Gabbrielle. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I'll do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
