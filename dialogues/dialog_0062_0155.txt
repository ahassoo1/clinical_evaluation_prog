DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… this shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for… well, I don't rightly know how long now. Seems to be getting worse, though. I just want to figure out what it is, if you can. Don’t have much patience for long visits, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll try to be efficient. The shaking in your hands… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Hard to say for sure. It’s worse when I try to… do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee… or buttoning my shirt. When I’m just sitting, it’s not so bad. Mostly. It’s just… annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Not that I recall. I retired a few years back, from the water treatment plant. That was a good while ago. Divorced my wife… even longer ago than that. Nothing new, no. Just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say it’s been happening for a while, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… oh, goodness. Maybe… a year? Or two? It started subtle, you know? Thought it was just me being clumsy. Now… well, now it's harder to ignore. It's just… difficult to pinpoint things these days. Memory’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful you’ve noticed it’s been progressing. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and just get a general sense of things. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Quick is good. Go ahead. I don't like doctors poking around too much, but if it gets me an answer… fine. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be gentle. Okay, Lyman, if you could just sit here for me, and I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll move on to the neurological exam. Okay, Lyman, can you extend both of your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There you go. It’s a bit shaky, as you can see. Not as bad as some days, thankfully. It's just... frustrating. Makes everything so much harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see that. And now, could you gently touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, and repeat that a few times?
PATIENT: There… like that. Bit off today, I suppose. It's not always this bad. Don’t mind the wandering, Doctor. It's just… the shaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, could you tap your fingers together, as quickly as you can, for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Like this… tap, tap, tap… getting tired already, to be honest. Not much energy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Lyman. That was helpful. I also want to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing what we call essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, usually in the hands, and tends to worsen with age. However, to be certain, and to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We'll check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and a complete metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Essential… tremor? Never heard of it. Sounds… complicated. Blood tests, eh? Fine, alright. As long as it doesn't take all day. Just want to know what’s going on, and then get on with things. Don’t really like doctors poking around much, but if you think it's necessary… go ahead. Just hurry it up, if you can.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lyman. It's not complicated in the sense that it's not necessarily a sign of something more serious. Many people live full lives with essential tremor. The blood tests will just help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a little blood, and the results should be back within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss treatment options if you’d like. There are medications that can help control the tremor, and in some cases, physical therapy can be beneficial. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Treatment, eh? Medications… I don't know. I try to avoid those if I can. Don't like the side effects, usually. Is it… serious? Will it get worse? That's what I want to know. And… will I be able to still, you know, do things? Still hold a cup of coffee?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Lyman. Essential tremor is usually not life-threatening, and it doesn’t typically shorten your lifespan. However, it can progress over time, meaning the tremor might gradually worsen. The rate of progression varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience only mild symptoms that remain stable for years, while others experience more significant worsening. As for being able to do things… that’s the million-dollar question. The tremor can certainly make everyday tasks more difficult, but there are strategies and treatments that can help you maintain your independence. We can discuss those once we have the lab results. Things like adaptive utensils, modified coffee mugs, and lifestyle adjustments can make a big difference. And if medication is something you decide you want to try, we’ll start with a low dose and monitor you closely for any side effects. For now, let's focus on getting those blood tests done. After that, we can make a plan that’s right for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, that sounds… reasonable. A plan. I like that. No rushing into things. Just… get the tests done, then see what happens. I suppose that's all I can do. Where do I go for these tests? And… how long will it take? I got a lunch appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very sensible approach. Here's the requisition. The lab is just down the hall to your left – room 102. They're usually pretty efficient. It should take no more than 30 minutes, including the waiting time. You should have plenty of time to make your lunch appointment. The receptionist will let them know you’re coming. And once you've had the blood drawn, you can come back and see me, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Whatever is easier for you. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's everything. Just… don't keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things. It's… reassuring. I’ll go get these tests done, then. .
