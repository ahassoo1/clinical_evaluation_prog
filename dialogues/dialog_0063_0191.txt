DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time to get checked for... for HIV. I wanted to know my status, really. It’s something I’ve been putting off, but I felt it was important to finally do.
DOCTOR: Right. HIV testing. Yes, a sensible precaution, I suppose. Though, at your age… well. Regardless. Have you had any recent reasons to be concerned?
PATIENT: Recent reasons? No, not particularly. Nothing specific has happened. It’s not about a specific incident, Doctor. It’s more… preventative. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful lately, and I just wanted peace of mind. It’s been a long time since either of us was tested, and with everything going around… well, it seemed a good idea to be sure.
DOCTOR: I see. Preventative. Very well. And you say “everything going around.” Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… just hearing things on the news. Stories about… well, you hear about people getting sick, and it makes you think. I don’t have all the details, Doctor, I just… it made me a little worried. I read something about it being easier to catch now, perhaps? Though, I could be mistaken. It’s just… a general unease, really.
DOCTOR: “Easier to catch.” A common misconception fueled by… unreliable sources, I assure you. Still. Your husband, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, my husband, Olu. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, almost forty years now. He’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. We both just… haven’t been tested in a while. And I thought, at our age, it's best to be certain, you know? It's not that I suspect anything, Doctor, it's just… responsible, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, responsible. Quite. Have either of you had… shall we say, outside partners at any point?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness, no. Never. Olu and I… we’ve been very faithful to each other all these years. It's never been a question, Doctor. I assure you. We've always been a one-partner couple. I wouldn't even know what to say if you suggested otherwise. It's... unthinkable.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any… transfusions?
PATIENT: Transfusions? Let me think… No, not that I recall. I've never needed a blood transfusion, Doctor. I haven’t had any major surgeries or anything that would require one. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. A few aches and pains with age, of course, but nothing serious. I can’t say I've ever been in a situation where I needed a transfusion.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. It’s been creeping up a bit lately, so the doctor prescribed a small tablet I take every morning. Otherwise, no. Just that one little pill. It’s nothing major, really. Just to keep things stable, he said. I can tell you the name if you like, but I don't have it memorized.
DOCTOR: No need. We can look it up. Now, any allergies to medications or… anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. No allergies to anything, Doctor. I’ve always been lucky that way. No food allergies, no reactions to bee stings… nothing. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicines in the past, as far as I remember. I’m quite a straightforward patient, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready whenever you are. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm happy to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Please, lie down on the table. I'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. As expected. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly… muffled. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let me check your lymph nodes. No swelling detected. Lymph nodes are normal.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, isn't it? Everything sounds normal? I do get a little breathless sometimes, just from walking up the stairs, but I assumed that was just my age. I appreciate you checking so thoroughly, Doctor. It’s reassuring.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Ms. Shaub. The slight breathlessness is likely age-related, as you say. But we must rule out other possibilities. Now, I will need to draw a sample of your blood for testing. Standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests, right. Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I don’t particularly like needles, but I understand it’s necessary. Is there anything I should do? Should I tense my arm, or relax it? I always get a little anxious about this part.
DOCTOR: Relax. Tensing makes it more difficult. Just… remain still. There. All done. Minimal discomfort, I assure you. Now, the results will take a few days to come back. We will contact you with the findings. Apply pressure to this for a few minutes. And try not to get it wet for the next hour.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. A few days, you said? Alright. I’ll try to remain calm in the meantime. Is there anything I should be looking out for? Any symptoms that would be… concerning? Just in case? I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Unlikely. But if you develop a fever, rash, or severe fatigue, contact us immediately. Though, given your history, I doubt it will come to that. We will be in touch. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Just the test results, really. Thank you for your time and for being so thorough. I appreciate it. I’ll keep an eye out for any of those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Shaub. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
