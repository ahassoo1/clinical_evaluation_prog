DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... cough. Yeah, I been coughing a lot. And tired. Real tired. Feels like… always got a cold, you know? Sinus… something? It hurts in my face sometimes. Been going on for… a while now, I think. I dunno exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and fatigue, feeling like a persistent cold with some facial pain. “A while now” is a bit vague, but we'll get there. Let's try to narrow that down. Can you recall when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It was… after the big rain, I think? Maybe… January? Or February? Everything kinda blends together, you know? I work outside a lot, changing tires... maybe started then. It's hard to remember for sure. I just kept thinking it would go away.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact start date. January or February – that gives us a starting point. So, roughly six or seven months now?
PATIENT: Yeah… six, seven months. Sounds right. Maybe longer. It's… it's just annoying, Doctor. I can't seem to shake it. And the tiredness… makes it hard to work. I gotta support my family, you know? Tires don't change themselves.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. Fatigue and a persistent cough can certainly interfere with daily life, especially with a physically demanding job. Let's try to get a clearer picture of your symptoms. Besides the cough and tiredness, have you experienced anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... Sometimes… my chest feels tight. Not always, but… yeah, tight. And I get a bit of a fever sometimes, I think. Not a big one. Just… warm. And… maybe a bit of body aches, along with the face pain. Oh! And I sneeze a lot. Sorry! achoo! See? A lot.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary! That’s helpful information. Chest tightness, occasional low-grade fever, body aches, facial pain, and sneezing. Okay. Let’s talk about that facial pain for a moment. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… around my nose and my forehead. And sometimes in my cheeks. Feels kinda… blocked up, you know? Like pressure. Like… when you have a bad cold. It gets worse when I bend over. That makes it feel… full. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pain around your nose, forehead, and cheeks, worse with bending over, feeling of pressure. That does sound consistent with sinus involvement. Have you noticed any colored discharge from your nose when you blow it?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Not always. When I do, it’s… kinda greenish. Or yellowish. Sorry, it's a bit gross to talk about. Usually it’s just clear, though. It's been a bad year for colds, I think. Everyone’s been sick.
DOCTOR: It's not gross at all, it’s important information. Greenish or yellowish discharge is definitely something to note. You mentioned everyone has been sick. Have you been around anyone specifically who was diagnosed with anything, like the flu or COVID?
PATIENT: Um… my wife had something last month. She was really tired, and had a bad cough. She didn't go to the doctor, though. Just stayed home and rested. My coworker, Ah Hock, he was out for a week with a fever. He said it was the flu, but I dunno. I think a lot of people at work were sick around the same time. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, potential exposure to someone with flu-like symptoms, and a coworker confirmed with the flu. Let's quickly go over some other things. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I mean, sometimes I get a bit of a sniffle when it’s really dusty, but nothing bad. I work with tires all day, there's always dust. I don’t think it’s allergies though. I never really had bad allergies before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or cold medicine?
PATIENT: Um... Sometimes I take paracetamol for the fever and aches. Just when it's bad. And I tried some… some cough syrup. The red one. Didn’t really help much. I don't like taking a lot of medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just paracetamol as needed and a cough syrup that didn’t provide much relief. Now, let's talk briefly about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or any heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I've always been pretty healthy, until this. Well, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that's it. No asthma, no… those other things you said. Just this cough. And the tiredness. It’s… been a long few months.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior chronic conditions. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. I don’t like hospitals, Doctor. I avoid them if I can. Hopefully I won't need one now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father… he had high blood pressure. And my mother… she had diabetes. She was always tired, too. And my uncle… he had some trouble breathing when he got older. I don’t know what it was though. They didn't really talk about it much. That’s about all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your father, diabetes in your mother, and some breathing problems in an uncle. Finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked. Never even tried it. Bad for you, you know? My wife doesn't like it either. I need to be healthy for her.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Tati. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now another one… and out. Alright. Your lungs sound a little congested, but no wheezing or crackles that are particularly concerning at this point. Your sinuses are tender to the touch, particularly around your forehead and cheeks. And your temperature is 38.1 Celsius – slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat and ears. Please open your mouth and say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhhh…
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a bit red and swollen, but nothing too alarming. Your ears look clear. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have an upper respiratory infection, possibly sinusitis. The congestion in your lungs could be related to the infection, or it could be something else. Given your slightly elevated temperature, we should consider getting a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A… X-ray? Is it… serious, Doctor? I don’t like radiation. Is there another way to find out? I just want to get better, not… more tests. But… if you think it’s important… I guess. I just… don't want anything bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. An X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of ruling out pneumonia, which can be serious, outweigh the risks in this case. It's a precautionary measure, to be certain of what we're dealing with. However, we can start with some supportive care and see if your symptoms improve. I will prescribe an antibiotic to address the potential sinus infection and a cough suppressant to help manage your cough. We can reassess in a few days, and if you don't improve, or if your symptoms worsen, we will proceed with the chest X-ray. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds better. No X-ray right now. Antibiotic… and cough medicine. That's okay. I can try that. Hopefully that will work, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. And go back to work… My family needs me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Tati. Let’s get you started on the path to recovery. I'm prescribing Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for seven days. Take it with food. And I’m also prescribing Dextromethorphan 15mg as needed for your cough, but no more than six times a day. It can cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. Also, please get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids – water, juice, herbal tea – and avoid strenuous activity until you feel better. If your fever goes above 38.5 Celsius, or if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or a severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also give you a printed sheet with detailed instructions on managing your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… three times a day. Okay, I can remember that. And no more than six cough medicine. Got it. Um… does the medicine interact with anything? I drink herbal tea sometimes… does that matter? And what if I feel a bit better after a few days? Do I still need to finish the whole course of antibiotics?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Tati. As for interactions, herbal tea is generally safe to drink with Amoxicillin, but avoid teas with a lot of caffeine as it can sometimes interfere with sleep, which is important for recovery. And yes, it's crucial to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better after a few days. Stopping early can allow some bacteria to survive and become resistant to the medication, leading to a relapse or a more difficult infection to treat in the future. Are there any other questions I can answer for you?
PATIENT: Okay… finish the whole course, even if I feel better. Got it. And no caffeine. That's good to know. I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll try my best to get better, and I'll come back if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. I’m glad I could help. Remember to prioritize rest and hydration. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Get well soon, and take care of yourself and your family.
