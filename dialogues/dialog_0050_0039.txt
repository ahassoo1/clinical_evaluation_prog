DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 88 years young. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-eight, you say? Feels like sixty-eight some days! The reason I'm here… oh, it was that blood test, I reckon. Something about my cholesterol being a bit high, the nurse told me. Didn’t quite understand all of it, to be honest. Never had much trouble with numbers, usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse did mention a recent blood test. “A bit high” is rather imprecise, unfortunately. We rely on specifics in medicine, Mr. Bohnett. Do you happen to recall which cholesterol level was elevated?
PATIENT: Oh dear, specifics… no, not really. I just remember her saying it wasn’t good, and that I should come see you. I don’t really pay attention to those little details, you know? I just let my daughter, Elsie, handle all that paperwork. She’s a smart one, that girl. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: It's…unfortunate that you don't recall the specifics, Mr. Bohnett. While Elsie is undoubtedly capable, it is important for you to have some understanding of your own health. However, we can certainly review the results together. Let me see…ah, yes. Your total cholesterol is 260 mg/dL, your LDL is 180 mg/dL, your HDL is 35 mg/dL, and your triglycerides are 200 mg/dL. These numbers are elevated. Do you understand those terms at all, or should I explain them?
PATIENT: Oh my… those are a lot of numbers. Not a lick, Doctor. I'm afraid all those things sound like… well, like a foreign language to me. Could you explain it, please? Just… nice and slow. And maybe tell me what it means if they're high? I used to work with people, helping them, not worrying about… this.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. I will endeavor to explain this in a manner you can understand, though I find it frustrating when patients do not take a more active role in their healthcare. Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood. There are different types. LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – can build up in your arteries and cause heart problems. HDL cholesterol – the “good” cholesterol – helps remove the LDL cholesterol. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. Your LDL is quite high at 180 – we want that below 100 ideally. Your HDL is a bit low at 35 – we like to see that above 60. And your triglycerides are also elevated. Essentially, you have a higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Do you follow?
PATIENT: Heart disease and stroke… that doesn’t sound good at all. So, the bad stuff is too high, and the good stuff is too low. I think I understand the basics of it, yes. But… what causes it? Is it something I did? I’ve always been pretty active, you know, even now I try to get out and walk when the weather’s nice. And I don’t eat a ton of rich food, although Elsie does bring me sweets sometimes… Is it something I can fix?
DOCTOR: There are multiple factors, Mr. Bohnett. Genetics play a role, unfortunately, which you cannot alter. Diet is significant – sweets, as you mentioned, are certainly contributing factors, as are saturated and trans fats. Activity level is positive, but it’s often not enough to counteract a poor diet. It is, regrettably, often a combination of lifestyle and inherited predisposition. “Fix” is a rather simplistic term. We aim for management. Lifestyle modifications are paramount. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, regular exercise, and, quite possibly, medication. Before we discuss medication, however, I need a more comprehensive understanding of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, that's… discouraging. Let me think… high blood pressure… no, not that I recall. The doctor did mention it once, years ago, but he said it was just a little high and to watch my salt intake. Nothing serious. Diabetes… no, never been told I had that. Elsie would have said something if I did, she's very good about these things. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, and the doctor gave me something for it. Does that matter? And… oh, I had the flu pretty bad last winter. Nearly knocked me off my feet, that did.
DOCTOR: “A little high” is still cause for concern, Mr. Bohnett, and it would have been preferable if it had been addressed more thoroughly at the time. Knee trouble, while not directly related to your cholesterol, could impact your ability to exercise, which is…unfortunate. The flu is a viral illness; it's irrelevant to this discussion. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol in your immediate family – your parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother… she lived to be ninety-two, bless her heart. She had a bit of trouble with her breathing towards the end, but I don't think it was her heart. My father… he died when I was quite young, a heart attack, I believe. That was a long time ago, though. I was only ten. I had an older brother, Sven, but he passed away in the war. I don’t really know much about his health. We didn’t see him much after he joined up.
DOCTOR: A heart attack in your father at a relatively young age is…significant, Mr. Bohnett. That places you at a higher risk. Your brother’s health is, unfortunately, unknown, but it does not negate the familial risk. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle in a bit more detail. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn't have allowed it. She always said it was a nasty habit, and it shortened your life. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Just one, mind you. Or maybe two, if Elsie is visiting and we're celebrating something. It helps me relax, you know? And I do enjoy a bit of herring now and then. It reminds me of home.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption, even in moderation, can impact your cholesterol levels and overall health, Mr. Bohnett. While one or two glasses of wine occasionally may not be detrimental, it is something to consider. The herring…is it prepared with a lot of salt?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie buys it from that Scandinavian deli downtown. It's pretty good stuff, if you ask me. And yes, I suppose it does have a bit of salt. It wouldn't be herring without it, would it? My mother used to make it herself, you know. She had a special recipe, passed down from her grandmother. It was a bit of work, but it was worth it. I don't really eat a lot of processed foods, mind you. Mostly just fresh vegetables and fish. And the occasional sweet, of course, when Elsie brings them.
DOCTOR: It appears you have a reasonably healthy diet overall, Mr. Bohnett, but the sodium content from the herring, the occasional alcohol consumption, and the sweets are contributing factors. Now, before we discuss a potential treatment plan, I need to perform a physical examination. Please remove your shoes and socks, and I will begin by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that's sensible. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know. Hopefully, everything isn't too bad. Elsie will be wanting to know how it went.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back, Mr. Bohnett. I will start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Bohnett. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although there is some diminished breath sound at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally, although they are slightly weak. There is some mild edema in your ankles. Your examination reveals slightly elevated blood pressure, some diminished breath sounds at the bases of your lungs, and mild edema in your ankles. These findings are consistent with your age and lifestyle, but they do warrant further attention. Now, let's discuss a plan to manage your cholesterol and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds… edema… it all sounds rather ominous, doesn’t it? I suppose I'm not as young as I used to be. So, what does all this mean? And what do you suggest we do about it? Are we talking about medication? I’ve always been a bit wary of taking pills, if I’m honest. Elsie says I should trust the doctors, but… I just prefer to avoid them if possible.
DOCTOR: While these findings are not immediately alarming, Mr. Bohnett, they do indicate that your cardiovascular system is under some stress. The diminished breath sounds could be due to mild fluid retention, while the edema in your ankles suggests that your heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should. As for medication… it is an option. Given your elevated cholesterol and blood pressure, and your family history, I believe it is a prudent one. We could start with a low dose of a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a low dose of a diuretic to lower your blood pressure. However, medication alone is not enough. Lifestyle modifications are crucial. This includes a low-fat, low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and weight management. I would also recommend reducing your alcohol consumption. Before we proceed with medication, I would like to order some additional tests, including a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels in more detail, a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Additional tests… medication… it’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I suppose if it’s what’s best for my health… but I’m still hesitant about taking pills. What are the side effects? Elsie always tells me to ask about the side effects. And what about the exercise? My knees aren't what they used to be, you know. What kind of exercise would be suitable for an old man like me?
DOCTOR: It is understandable that you are hesitant, Mr. Bohnett. It is always best to be fully informed before making any decisions about your health. As for the side effects of a statin, the most common ones are muscle aches and pains. However, these are usually mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. There is a small risk of liver damage, but this is rare and can be monitored with regular blood tests. The diuretic can cause frequent urination and dehydration, but this can be managed by drinking plenty of fluids. As for exercise, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. Low-impact exercises, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, are good options. You can also try gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises to improve your flexibility and mobility. I would recommend consulting with a physical therapist to develop a personalized exercise plan that is safe and effective for you. Before we proceed, let me explain the tests I have ordered. The lipid panel will provide a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, including your LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. The complete blood count will assess your overall health and identify any potential underlying conditions. The electrocardiogram will assess your heart function and identify any abnormalities. Do you have any further questions at this point?
PATIENT: Muscle aches… frequent urination… it all sounds rather unpleasant. But I suppose if it’s what’s necessary… Elsie would want me to get the tests done. She's always been very practical. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to keep you waiting too long. I know you're a busy man. And one more thing… is there anything I can do right now to improve my health? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. You can have these tests done at the laboratory across the street. The receptionist there will have all the necessary paperwork. It typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. I will contact you as soon as they are available. And yes, there are things you can do right now to improve your health. First, I recommend reducing your sodium intake. Avoid processed foods, fast food, and salty snacks. Second, I recommend increasing your fluid intake. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Third, I recommend getting regular exercise, even if it's just a short walk each day. And finally, I recommend reducing your alcohol consumption. I would also recommend that you keep a food diary for the next week, so we can assess your current dietary habits. And I would like you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can provide you with a blood pressure cuff and instructions on how to use it. Do you have any questions about any of these recommendations?
PATIENT: Reduce sodium… increase fluids… regular exercise… reduce alcohol… it's a lot to take in, Doctor. A food diary… and monitoring my blood pressure at home… Elsie will be happy to help with that, I'm sure. She's very organized. A blood pressure cuff… yes, that would be helpful. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a little, even though it's still a bit worrisome. I suppose I should go and get these tests done then. And I'll start on the food diary and try to cut back on the salt. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. I expect to hear from you soon. And remember, consistency is key. Small changes can make a big difference. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the tests. Have a good day. .
