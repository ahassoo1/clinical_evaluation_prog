DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... well, it's something about a letter. A pet letter, I think? My niece, she said I needed one. Something about owning a dog. Honestly, these things are just… a bother, aren't they? I can’t really recall all the details. She handles all my paperwork these days, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re referring to a letter regarding pet ownership, perhaps documentation for a dog?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A dog. A big one, apparently. My son… well, his dog, really. He wants me to… I don't know, officially have it? He's making a fuss about needing this letter for… something to do with where I live? Honestly, young people and their rules. Is this something you just have to have these days? It seems ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon for rural areas to have specific ordinances regarding pet ownership, especially concerning larger breeds. It often relates to liability or ensuring responsible pet care. It’s possible this letter is a requirement to comply with those local regulations. To clarify, Ms. Wrye, is your son requesting this letter because of a homeowner's association rule, a lease agreement, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ordinances… Is that like… rules? See, this is what I mean! Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest. He just said I needed it. Something about the… the property management. That sounds right, doesn't it? He's renting, I think. Though, why I need a letter for his dog, I still don’t understand. He should be handling this himself. It's always something with those boys. It's just… a lot of fuss for a perfectly good animal.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the request is stemming from a property management requirement related to your son’s rental agreement, and they’re asking you to provide documentation. I see. To best assist you, Ms. Wrye, let’s gather a few more details. Do you know what kind of documentation they are specifically requesting?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Documentation… He didn't say. He just… handed me this form with a lot of blank spaces and said "Get this signed." Honestly, I didn't even look at it closely. It’s probably one of those legal things, full of tiny writing and… and clauses. I just assumed you could fill it out and be done with it. Is there something special I need to know about this form? I haven't got my reading glasses with me, you see. Everything just looks like a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to receive a form without clear instructions, especially without your glasses. It's perfectly alright if you haven’t reviewed it closely. Do you happen to have the form with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. It is small writing, isn’t it? And there are so many boxes… honestly, it looks like a tax form. He makes everything so complicated. Just look at all this legal jargon. I wouldn't know where to begin.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wrye. Yes, this is quite detailed. It appears to be a "Pet Addendum" to a lease agreement, requiring information about the dog’s breed, weight, vaccinations, and your acknowledgement of certain responsibilities as a pet owner. I see a section here requesting information about your relationship to the tenant – is that your son?
PATIENT: Yes, that's him. Kevin. My only son. He’s… a bit much sometimes, always worrying about rules and regulations. He's very responsible, I suppose, which is good. But honestly, this whole thing… It’s just a dog! A lovely, big, fluffy thing. He doesn’t bite, I assure you. Though, I haven't seen him in a few weeks, so I can’t guarantee anything. But he was a puppy when Kevin got him, and very well-behaved. I just don't understand why I need to be involved in all of this paperwork. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon for landlords to require pet owners – or anyone residing on the property with a pet – to sign an addendum outlining responsibilities. It’s a liability issue for them. To ensure I can accurately complete this for you, Ms. Wrye, could you confirm the dog's breed and approximate weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The breed… hmm. He said something fancy. One of those… fluffy ones. A… a Goldendoodle, I think? Yes, that’s it. A Goldendoodle. And the weight… Kevin mentioned he’s gotten quite big. Probably… around seventy pounds? Maybe seventy-five. He's a big boy, that dog. A very big, fluffy boy. I haven't weighed him myself, of course. I wouldn't know where to begin! Honestly, it's all a bit much. I just want to get this letter signed and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a Goldendoodle, approximately seventy to seventy-five pounds. Thank you. Now, this form also asks about vaccinations. Do you have any records of the dog's vaccinations, or would you happen to know if he's current on rabies, distemper, and parvovirus?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Vaccinations… That's another thing I haven’t got a clue about. Kevin handles all that. He’s very diligent about taking him to the vet. He always says, “Mom, don’t worry, I’ve got it covered!” I just… trust him. He’s very responsible, as I said. I haven’t seen the records, though. I’m afraid I can’t be of much help with that. Honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. I just want this letter, and then I can forget about the whole thing. Is there a way you can just… say he’s current? Would that be alright? I'm sure Kevin wouldn't let him go without his shots. He’s very careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. However, I cannot ethically certify the dog's vaccination status without documented proof. Falsifying that information could have legal ramifications for both you and your son, and could pose a public health risk. Perhaps we can contact your son directly to obtain the vaccination records?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Legal ramifications… Honestly, this is getting much too complicated. I just wanted a simple letter! Very well. You're right, of course. I shouldn’t be asking you to… to bend the truth. I suppose I’ll have to call Kevin. He’s probably annoyed I haven't already asked him. Do you have his number here? Perhaps you could call him directly? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’d probably just end up confusing him.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I have his number on file from a previous visit. Let me see if I can reach him directly. One moment, please. "Hello?
PATIENT: Oh, that's Kevin! Yes, yes, put him on, please. Tell him it’s his mother. And tell him to bring the vaccination records. Please. Thank you, dear. You’re a lifesaver. Honestly, young people and their paperwork... It's just too much.
DOCTOR: While we're waiting for Kevin, Ms. Wrye, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. That's quite enough, thank you. I'm just glad we're finally getting this sorted out. I just want to be done with it, really. Honestly, I don't understand why everything has to be so complicated. I suppose I should probably try to remember what the property manager’s name was… just in case. But my memory… it's just not what it used to be. It's all a bit of a blur, really. It’s probably best if Kevin handles all the details. He’s very good with these things.
DOCTOR: "Mom?
PATIENT: Oh, there he is! Yes, Kevin! It's your mother. Dr. Alanes here needs the vaccination records for the dog. The property manager needs them, you see… and it's all a bit complicated. Tell her everything, dear. Honestly, young people and their paperwork… I just want this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Kevin has emailed the vaccination records, and we've confirmed the property manager’s name is Ms. Davies. I’ll review these records to ensure they meet the requirements. Once I'm satisfied, I’ll complete and sign the pet addendum for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, dear! Wonderful! Thank you so much. That’s such a relief. Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Honestly, you’ve been a lifesaver. I don’t know what I would have done without you. I just want to be able to show Ms. Davies this letter and be done with it, really. It’s all a bit much for an old woman, you see. But thank you. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. It’s my pleasure to help. I'm just reviewing the records now, and everything appears to be in order. Here you are. This should satisfy Ms. Davies’ requirements. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, dear! Perfect! Thank you so much. Honestly, you've been a lifesaver. I can’t thank you enough. No, I don't think so. That's everything. I just want to get home now and show this to Ms. Davies. I'm sure she'll be pleased. Thank you again, dear. You've been a wonderful help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and please give your son my regards.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear! I will, I will. He’s a good boy, really. Very responsible. Thank you again for everything. You've been a lifesaver.
