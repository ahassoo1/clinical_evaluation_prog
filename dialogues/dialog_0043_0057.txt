DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’ll be your doctor today. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Kalinski. It’s nice to meet you too. I… well, I’m here because of the cancer. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly is difficult news to process, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what’s been happening and how I can best support you, could you tell me a little more about the cancer?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It’s in my… my chest. They told me it was a type of… a type of tumor. I don’t remember the exact name. It was found a few months ago. They did… a lot of tests. And then they started treatment.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A tumor in the chest... alright. And you mentioned several tests and then treatment began. Do you recall what kind of treatment you’ve been receiving?
PATIENT: They gave me… pills. Every day. And then I had to go in for… for something with a big machine. It made a lot of noise. It wasn’t… pleasant. I think it was… radiation? Is that right? I’m sorry, I forget things easily. It’s been… a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in, and forgetting details is very common when you’re dealing with something like this. Pills daily and a treatment with a large, noisy machine… that does sound like radiation therapy. Just to confirm, and for my records, do you remember approximately when you started the radiation treatment, and approximately how long ago did you finish?
PATIENT: Let me think… I started the pills in… February, I believe. The radiation… maybe around April? And I finished it… in June. Yes, June, I think. It felt like it went on forever. I haven't been feeling very good since it ended.
DOCTOR: Alright, February for the pills, April through June for radiation. And you’ve been feeling unwell since finishing treatment. Could you describe what you mean by "not feeling very good"?
PATIENT: Um… tired. All the time. Even when I sleep. And… I don’t have much appetite. Everything tastes… wrong. And sometimes… my chest hurts. Not like a sharp pain, but… heavy. Like someone is sitting on it. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. I get winded really easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so persistent fatigue, loss of appetite with a change in taste, and a heavy chest sensation that causes shortness of breath. That's important information, Chellsea. To get a clearer picture, could you rate your fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Hmm… a ten feels like I can’t even get out of bed. I think… I’m probably around a seven or eight. Most days. It makes it hard to… do anything. Even things I used to enjoy. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: A seven or eight… I understand. That's significantly impacting your daily life. And you mentioned this is making it hard to do things you used to enjoy. Now, aside from the fatigue, the chest heaviness and the loss of appetite, have you noticed any other changes – any coughing, fever, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, or any swelling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no chills. I haven’t really weighed myself, so I don’t know about weight loss. I do get… a little short of breath when I walk. And… my hands sometimes feel a little numb. Not all the time, just… sometimes. No swelling. And I haven’t had night sweats.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, night sweats, or swelling. Shortness of breath with walking and occasional numbness in your hands. Thank you for sharing all of this, Chellsea. Now, to help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… before this… I was pretty healthy. I haven’t had… many problems. I had pneumonia once, when I was a child. And… my husband… he passed away last year. That was… difficult. But besides that… nothing major. I don’t really have any allergies. And I’m on Medicare. That’s… that’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That must have been incredibly difficult. Pneumonia as a child and otherwise healthy. No known allergies, and you're covered by Medicare. That's good to know. Now, just to confirm, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. Just… regular checkups with the doctor. Before all this, of course. Everything was fine then. It all happened so fast. I don't understand how things changed so quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel that way, Chellsea. It's often shocking when things change so quickly. No surgeries, just regular checkups prior to your diagnosis. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a hard one. My mother… she had some problems with her heart, when she was older. But she lived to be… eighty-five. My father… he was healthy. I don’t really know much about my grandparents. They passed away when I was very young. I don’t think anyone else in my family had… cancer. But I’m not really sure. I didn't pay much attention to medical things before.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chellsea. It’s common not to know detailed family medical histories. History of heart problems in your mother, otherwise limited information. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. I don’t use any drugs. Never have. I always tried to take care of myself. I just… I don't understand why this is happening. I'm a very healthy person.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Chellsea. You’ve consistently maintained a healthy lifestyle. It’s completely valid to feel confused and frustrated, and it’s not uncommon to question why these things happen even to those who prioritize their health. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – and do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… just the pills the doctor gave me for the cancer. I think they’re… let me see… Temozolomide. Yes, that’s right. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches. No allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I always check with the pharmacist, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Temozolomide for the cancer and Tylenol as needed for headaches, no known allergies. Excellent that you always check with the pharmacist. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll check your abdomen and feel for any swelling in your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. That’s alright. I just… I get nervous when doctors touch me. It reminds me of… everything. But… I’ll try. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. I completely understand. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything I'm doing as I go. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. We can pause or stop at any moment if you need to. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in the lower part of your right lung. It's subtle, but worth noting. I’ll check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter now. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within a normal range. Now, I'll palpate your abdomen. This just involves gently pressing on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And finally, I’ll check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged in the right armpit, but they aren’t particularly hard or painful. Everything else feels within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that wasn’t too bad. But… what does it all mean? What did you hear in my lungs? And what about the tenderness and the swelling? Is it… is it getting worse? I'm scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to be scared when you're facing something like this. The slight crackling I heard in your lungs could indicate a small amount of fluid buildup, which can sometimes occur with cancer treatment. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could be related to the cancer itself, or it could be a side effect of the treatment. And the slightly enlarged lymph nodes are something we need to investigate further. It's important to remember that these are just initial findings. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some additional tests. Specifically, I recommend a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any other potential causes for the crackling sound. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate the extent of the cancer and see if it has spread to any other areas. And finally, I'd like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health and see if there are any other changes. These tests will help me determine the best course of treatment for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. If it will help. I just… I want to know what’s happening. I can’t keep feeling like this. Scared and… and unsure. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Chellsea. It’s perfectly valid to want answers and to feel overwhelmed. We will get you the answers you need. The tests are relatively quick and straightforward. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the CT scan will take a bit longer, maybe 20-30 minutes. As for discomfort, the X-ray is painless. The CT scan requires an intravenous injection of contrast dye, which some people experience as a warm sensation. There’s a small risk of allergic reaction to the dye, but it’s very rare, and we’ll monitor you closely throughout the procedure. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail and create a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, or severe pain, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For being… gentle. And for explaining everything. I'm still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing what’s going to happen. Can… can someone help me schedule the tests? I don't think I can do it myself right now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help ease your mind, even a little. And you're absolutely right to let us handle scheduling the tests. It's perfectly okay to ask for help, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. Sarah, could you please assist Chellsea with scheduling the chest X-ray and CT scan?
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will take good care of you. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
