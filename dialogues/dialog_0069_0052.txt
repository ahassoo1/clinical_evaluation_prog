DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. Nice tae meet ye as well. Well, it’s this nausea, see. Been gettin' it most mornings now. Not a pleasant way tae start the day, I can tell ye that much. And the nurse mentioned somethin' about me heart when I was fillin' out the forms... is that connected, d'ye think?
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea most mornings… that’s certainly not ideal. And it’s good you brought up the heart concern the nurse noted. It’s wise to consider everything. Let's definitely explore both of those things. To get a better understanding of the nausea, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not like a proper sick feeling, ye ken? No… like I’m gonna be throwin’ up, just a queasy sort o’ feelin’ in me stomach. It usually starts fairly soon after I get up, and it lingers for a couple o’ hours. Doesn’t matter what I’ve eaten the night before, seems like. And it's nothin' specific makin’ it worse, not that I’ve noticed. Just… there. And it's been happenin' for, oh, maybe three weeks now, steadily gettin' a wee bit worse each time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a queasy feeling, not necessarily with vomiting, that starts shortly after waking and lasts a couple of hours, regardless of what you eat. And it's been gradually worsening over the past three weeks. That’s helpful. Now, regarding the heart… were you told about anything specific, or was it just a general question on the form?
PATIENT: It was a general question on the form, but the nurse did ask a wee bit more. She mentioned somethin' about heart failure. I was diagnosed wi' it, oh… must be five, maybe six years ago now. I see a specialist back in Inverness, but I haven’t seen him in a while, tae be honest. He put me on some medication, but I’ve been feelin' fine mostly, just… tired, ye ken? Normal tired for an auld man. I just assumed the nausea was somethin' else entirely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of heart failure diagnosed about five or six years ago, you're managed by a specialist in Inverness, and you’re currently on medication for it. And you’ve been feeling generally tired, which you attributed to age, but now we’re considering whether the nausea might be related. Could you remind me what medication you’re currently taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think… it’s a wee blue tablet. Starts wi' an “F”, I think. Furo… Furosemide, that’s it! And a white one, Lisinopril. I take 40 milligrams o’ the Furosemide, and… 20 milligrams o’ the Lisinopril, I believe. I’ve been takin' 'em regularly, mind ye, same dose every day. I've not changed anythin' recently, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide 40mg and Lisinopril 20mg, taken regularly. That’s good to know. It's helpful that you haven’t made any changes to your medication regimen. Given your history of heart failure and the medications you're on, nausea can be a symptom, although it's not the most common one. However, it’s important to rule out other causes as well. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Aye, well… I’ve been a wee bit more short o' breath lately, comin’ up the stairs, that sort o’ thing. I put it down tae… well, bein' auld, again. And me ankles are a bit swollen at the end o’ the day. Not terrible, but noticeable. I’ve also been feelin’ a bit lightheaded sometimes, when I stand up quickly. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve a good appetite, still enjoy me food, and I'm sleepin' alright, most nights.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed increased shortness of breath with exertion, ankle swelling at the end of the day, and occasional lightheadedness when standing. And you have a good appetite and generally sleep well. These symptoms, along with the nausea, could be related to your heart condition. The ankle swelling and shortness of breath suggest potential fluid retention, which can happen with heart failure. The lightheadedness could also be a sign. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve nothin’ to hide, and I trust yer judgement. Just… be gentle wi' the ankles, if ye would. They’re a wee bit tender.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Mr. Benic. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, and your ankles do have some swelling, as you mentioned. Your heart sounds are a little bit distant, and I am hearing a murmur. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings from the exam, it’s likely your nausea is related to your heart failure. The swelling and crackles suggest you might be retaining fluid, which can put extra strain on your heart and cause symptoms like nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The murmur is something we've known about, but it’s important to keep monitoring. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a BNP, which is a marker of heart strain, and a kidney function panel. I also recommend an ECG to check for any changes in your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds right enough, Doctor. If it's got somethin' tae do wi' the heart, best get it checked properly. Blood tests and an ECG... go right ahead. I’m happy enough tae do whatever ye think is best. Will I need tae go somewhere special for them, or can I get them done here?
DOCTOR: Good. We can do both the blood tests and the ECG right here in the clinic. I’ll write you up a requisition form for the blood tests. The nurse will draw your blood, and then we'll do the ECG in the exam room after that. It's a quick and painless procedure—just some stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. While we're waiting for the results, I’d also like to adjust your medication slightly. I’m going to increase your Furosemide dosage to 60mg daily to help get rid of some of that fluid. It’s important to monitor your weight closely after this increase. If you notice any significant weight gain or worsening symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough, Doctor. Increase the water tablets, and keep a close watch on me weight... I can manage that. I've a good set o’ scales at home. 60 milligrams, ye said? Right. I'll write that down just tae be sure. And I will get in touch if I start feelin’ any worse, or if I put on any weight. I appreciate ye takin' the time tae look after me. It's a comfort, knowin' someone is payin' attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, 60 milligrams of Furosemide daily. And you're very welcome, Mr. Benic. That's what I'm here for. Once the results are back – usually within a few hours – we'll discuss them and make a plan going forward. We may need to adjust your medications further, or consider a referral to a cardiologist if things don’t improve. I’ll also want to talk about diet and lifestyle modifications to help manage your heart failure. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and do the ECG. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think ye've covered everything, Doctor. Ye've put me mind at ease, knowin' we're gettin' tae the bottom o' it. Just... thank ye again. I'll wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. It was a pleasure meeting you. We’ll take good care of you. .
