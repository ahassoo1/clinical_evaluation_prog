DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Thank you. Well, it’s… a bit hard to explain. My… someone I care about, she’s thinking about having a baby. And I thought… maybe it’s good to check things first? Make sure… everything is okay. I’m not so young anymore, you see. And neither is she. I just want to be sure we’re… ready.
DOCTOR: Ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready… like, healthy. Strong. I don’t… I don’t know all the things you check for. I just… I’ve heard stories. And I want… to not have any problems. For her, mostly. I don't want to cause any trouble. It's... it’s a big thing, having a baby. And I want to be a good… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s… responsible of you to be thinking about this, Mr. Verrall. It’s good you’re not just waltzing into this without a thought. Now, let's be clear, you’re the one here for the check-up. It sounds like you’re concerned about your own health in relation to potential parenthood. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… yes, exactly. It’s me. I need to be… okay. I haven’t… I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. I mostly just… try to stay out of trouble, you know? But this feels… different. Important. So, what do you check for? I’m not… good with remembering things, so please speak slowly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, at your age, Mr. Verrall, we have a number of things to consider. We'll do a full physical, of course – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure. But more importantly, we need to look at things like your cholesterol, blood sugar… rule out any underlying conditions that could affect… well, your ability to participate in this venture. And of course, we’ll want to discuss your family history. Anything significant on either side?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history? Um… my father… he had… problems with his stomach, I think. But it was a long time ago. And my mother… she was healthy, I think. Very strong woman. But… I don't really know. They lived… far away. A long time ago. Cholesterol? Blood sugar? What… what does that mean? Is that bad? I don't understand all these words.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Let's start with the basics. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood. Too much can clog up your arteries, leading to heart problems. Blood sugar… well, that’s how your body processes energy. High blood sugar can mean diabetes. These are things we check routinely to make sure you’re… robust enough to handle the stresses of… a growing family. Now, let’s get started with some questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't think so. I've never been to the doctor much. Just… when I broke my arm, when I was a boy. And… a cold, sometimes. But nothing… serious. I feel… okay. Mostly. My back aches a little, sometimes. But that’s just… old age, I guess. But no… no high blood pressure. No sugar sickness. I don’t even like sweets that much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No. No medicines. Never have. I try to stay away from those things. They… they can’t be good for you, can they? I just… drink a lot of tea. Herbal tea. Helps my stomach. But that’s it. Nothing from the… pharmacy. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. I mean… sometimes my eyes get itchy when the flowers bloom. But that’s just… pollen, isn’t it? Everyone gets that, I think. No… no bad reactions to food. No… bee stings. Nothing like that. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. Not that I’ve ever noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Verrall, let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t like doctors much. But… I want to do this. For her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie back, please. I’m going to listen to your chest, both front and back. Try to breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… good. Anything here sounds a little… diminished. We may need to do some further tests, just to be safe. Blood pressure is… elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s have a look at your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished? What does that mean? Is that… bad? I’m trying to breathe normally. It’s just… I get nervous at the doctor. Always have. My legs feel… funny. A little weak.
DOCTOR: It means… it's not what I'd expect for someone your age. Could be perfectly normal, but we need to investigate. Alright, let's see… reflexes are a little… sluggish. Not concerning on their own, but it’s adding to the picture. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, please. This is to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Anything here feel… a little firm. Not anything major, but it warrants further investigation. Do you have any… bowel issues?
PATIENT: Bowel issues? Um… what does that mean? I… I go to the toilet. When I need to. Sometimes it’s a little… hard. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everyone gets… blocked up sometimes. I eat a lot of vegetables. That helps, I think. But no… no… serious issues. I don’t… bleed or anything. Just… normal. As far as I know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Verrall, based on this preliminary examination, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your blood sugar and kidney function, and a cholesterol panel. And… I'd also like to order a stool sample to rule out any hidden issues. It’s just… to be thorough. We need a clearer picture of what’s going on before we can determine if you're… suitable for the stresses of parenthood, so to speak. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Stool sample? You want… my… you want me to bring in… a sample? Oh. That… that’s a bit… embarrassing. Is that really necessary? I mean… couldn't we just… ask some more questions? I’m sure I’m fine. I eat a lot of vegetables, I told you. And I drink a lot of tea! I just… I don't know about bringing in a… sample. That sounds… awful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, I'm a doctor. These are routine tests. We're not just looking for big problems here. We're looking for potential problems. And a stool sample can tell us a great deal about your digestive health, which is important, especially given your age and the fact that you haven't seen a doctor in… well, a long time. It’s a simple procedure. The lab will give you instructions. It’s far better to be safe than sorry, especially when someone else’s wellbeing is at stake. Here. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and the stool sample. The lab is just down the street. Take these with you, and they'll explain everything. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A stool sample. I suppose… I suppose you're right. It’s just… embarrassing. And I don’t like hospitals, or… labs. They always smell funny. But… for her. I’ll do it. I’ll bring in the sample. When… when do I need to do that? And what… what exactly do they want me to do? I need… very clear instructions.
DOCTOR: The instructions are right here. You'll need to collect a small sample, using the container they provide. They'll give you specific details about how to do that. Just follow the instructions carefully. As for when to do it, try to do it within the next two or three days. And schedule the blood work as soon as possible. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Just… the stool sample. And the blood work. It sounds… a lot. But… thank you. For… explaining things. And for… not laughing. I’ll… I’ll go and do that. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Verrall. .
