DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I’ve gained weight. Quite a bit, actually, and I haven’t changed anything about my eating or exercise. It’s rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Perplexing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I eat the same things I always have – mostly simple, home-cooked meals. And I walk every day, like I always do. About a mile, usually. It’s… it’s just appeared, this extra weight. It began, oh, perhaps three months ago? I remember the date precisely, it was April 2nd, because it was my anniversary. And I noticed my trousers felt a little snug.
DOCTOR: April 2nd… alright. And how much weight would you estimate you’ve gained since then, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I weigh myself regularly. About fifteen pounds, I would say. Perhaps a little more. It’s… it’s unsettling. I haven't been feeling unwell, just… larger. And my husband has noticed, of course. He worries.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in three months… without any changes to your diet or activity level. Hmm. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fatigue, no changes in my skin… I sleep soundly. My appetite is normal, perhaps a little more than usual, but not significantly. No swelling, no… I don’t know how to describe it. Just… the weight. It’s the unexplained part that bothers me so. I pride myself on being observant, and I haven’t noticed anything else amiss.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your menstrual cycle, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that is a… personal question, Doctor. I haven’t… I haven’t had a cycle for several years now. I am past menopause. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It can be. Weight changes are common around menopause, though unexplained weight gain always warrants investigation. Now, let's go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions - diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I’ve always been… quite healthy, really. My family has good genes, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. No surgeries, no chronic pain, no… I can’t think of anything else. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally an over-the-counter pain reliever for aches and pains, but that’s it. I have regular check-ups with my GP, but he hasn’t noticed anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother lived to be eighty-seven, very active until the end. My father passed away younger, at seventy-two, from a heart condition, but that was… lifestyle-related, I believe. He smoked, unfortunately. My sister is healthy, a bit overweight perhaps, but otherwise well. No history of thyroid problems or diabetes that I am aware of. We are Lithuanian, you see, and our family tends to be… robust, shall we say. But not usually this… sudden.
DOCTOR: Lithuanian… alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, Ms. Selbitschka. I'll need to check your thyroid, listen to your heart and lungs, and just generally take a look. Then we can discuss potential causes and, if necessary, order some blood work. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement. I would like to understand what’s happening, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please step onto the scale for me, we'll start there. Then we can proceed with the rest of the exam. 83 kilograms. That confirms your weight gain. Now, if you could just have a seat on the examination table… I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Thyroid is normal size, no nodules or tenderness detected. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, let's check your reflexes…
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear about the heart and lungs, at least. My husband was quite worried about that. I do appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. Please, continue with the reflexes. I’m a little nervous, if I’m being honest, but I’m trying to remain calm. Is there anything I should be particularly concerned about at this stage? I understand you haven’t finished the examination yet, but… just a little reassurance would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Selbitschka, it's far too early to be concerned. I’m simply gathering information. Reflexes are normal. However, weight gain, especially unexplained weight gain, can have several causes. It could be hormonal, related to your metabolism, or even a side effect of medication, though you only mentioned a multivitamin. At this stage, we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a metabolic panel. That will give us a clearer picture. Don't jump to conclusions. It's likely something relatively straightforward, but it's best to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. You’re right, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. My husband… he worries excessively. I apologize for my nervousness. Blood work seems… sensible. A complete picture, as you say. Is there anything I should avoid doing before the blood work? Any dietary restrictions or… anything? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Friday, and I’d like to know if I need to reschedule it.
DOCTOR: No dietary restrictions are necessary before the blood work. Fasting is not required. As for the results, it typically takes about three to five business days for the lab to process everything. I can have the results sent directly to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. A bridge game on Friday… I doubt the results will be back by then, so you can go ahead and attend. Just try not to stress about it. I’m printing out a lab requisition form now. You can take this to any accredited laboratory. Do you have any questions before I conclude this examination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and thoroughness. I will take the requisition form to the laboratory as soon as possible. And I will try to remain… calm. I appreciate your reassurance, and I look forward to the results. Perhaps I will mention to my husband that it is likely something straightforward. He tends to catastrophize. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
