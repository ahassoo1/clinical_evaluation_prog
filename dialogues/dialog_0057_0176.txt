DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just…won't stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that have been going on for over two days. That does sound frustrating. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. They started… on Saturday, I believe. I was laughing with a friend, a really good belly laugh, and then bam, they started. I tried holding my breath, like you do, and drinking water quickly, but nothing seems to work. They come and go, but they keep coming back. It's not constant, but it’s… regular, if that makes sense? Like every few minutes, at least. And they’re… pretty strong, actually. Not tiny little ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started after a good laugh on Saturday, and you've tried the usual home remedies – holding your breath and drinking water. You said they're pretty strong and happen fairly regularly, about every few minutes. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger them, besides the initial laughing?
PATIENT: That's right. And no, not really. I've been trying to think, but nothing specific. I had a cup of tea this morning, and nothing. I ate a sandwich for lunch, no change. I even tried lying down for a bit, hoping it would calm me, but still… hic …still hiccuping. It’s just…random, I guess. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no obvious triggers even with trying different things. And they continue to be fairly consistent, happening every few minutes. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, that’s the thing. Nothing else. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no shortness of breath. I feel… normal, other than being very annoyed by these hiccups, of course! I haven't had a fever or anything like that either. Just… hic …hiccups. I'm starting to worry, though, because they’ve been going on so long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Redeye. Hiccups lasting over two days do warrant investigation. Let me ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Ask away. I don't really have a long medical history, thankfully, but I’ll do my best to answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. First, have you ever experienced hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they usually go away after a few minutes, or maybe an hour at most. Nothing like this. This is… different. Really different. I had a bout last year, maybe, but it was over quickly. This is the longest they’ve ever lasted. hic … honestly, it’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new experience for you in terms of duration. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had a few… minor things over the years, a bit of back pain, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. My doctor always said I was very healthy, even when I was heavier. I haven’t been to a doctor for a proper check-up in… oh, maybe five years? I usually just avoid them if I can, to be honest. hic … it's silly, I know. But I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Redeye, no need to feel silly. Many people feel that way. And that’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual things, like wisdom teeth removed when I was younger. But nothing major. hic… honestly, I feel like a bit of a hypochondriac now, talking about all this! It’s just hiccups, right? But why won't they stop?
DOCTOR: You’re not being a hypochondriac at all. It's good you’re bringing this up. We just want to rule things out, especially since they've been persistent. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some problems with his heart, later in life. He had a stroke, actually. But other than that, I don’t really know. My family isn’t very good at talking about health things, if you know what I mean. hic… it's always been a bit of a taboo subject. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and heart problems on your parents’ side. Thank you. Now, do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications at all. I avoid them if I can, really. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. That’s why I tried the water and holding my breath. I haven’t taken anything prescription in… well, ever, I think. hic… it's just… these hiccups are getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no current medications. And you prefer natural remedies. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I eat everything, pretty much. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I remember as a child my mother always said I was a very robust baby, I didn’t get sick much. hic… it’s strange that this is bothering me so much! It's just… annoying, and a bit worrying, after two days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Thank you, Ms. Redeye, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I'm just hoping you can figure out what's causing these hic… endless hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay. Please sit back and try to relax. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm not finding anything immediately concerning on the physical exam, but given the duration of your hiccups, it would be prudent to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: That’s… good to know, I guess. So, no immediate cause you can find? Blood work, alright. What kind of things are you looking for? Is it something serious? hic… I'm starting to get a little worried now, to be honest. I just want these hiccups to stop! I have plans this weekend, and I can't very well go if I'm constantly… hic …hiccuping.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Redeye. It's good that we’re investigating. The blood work will give us a broader picture. We’ll be checking your electrolytes – things like potassium and sodium – as imbalances can sometimes cause prolonged hiccups. We’ll also check your kidney function and a complete blood count to rule out infection or any other underlying medical conditions. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to be thorough. It could be something as simple as a minor irritation of the diaphragm, but persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something else, so we want to rule those things out first. It’s a precautionary measure. Would you be able to give me a sample of your urine while you're here today?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Electrolytes and kidney function. That sounds… sensible, I suppose. I just… I feel silly being poked and prodded over something like hiccups. But if it’s best to rule things out, then I’m happy to do it. hic… and yes, I can give a urine sample. Where do I go? Hopefully, it won’t take too long. I really just want to get this sorted out. This weekend is important.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Ms. Redeye. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way, and it's always best to address health concerns, no matter how small they seem. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There's a collection cup and instructions inside. Once you have the sample, just bring it to the lab window, and they’ll take care of it. I'll order the blood work as well. It usually takes a few hours to get the results back. In the meantime, if the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you experience any other symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and call you to discuss them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. I’ll go and get the urine sample now. Shortness of breath, chest pain, fever… okay, I’ve noted that. hic… I really appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It's just… been so disruptive. Hopefully, it’s just a minor irritation. I'll go and do that now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I’m happy to help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting. Take your time. I’ll be here when you get back.
PATIENT: Okay. hic Thank you again. I will. .
