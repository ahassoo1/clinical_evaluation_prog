DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Right… well, it’s these headaches, see. They come on pretty strong, and then… I get really sweaty, and my heart kinda feels like it’s racing. It’s been happening on and off for a while now. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started, just that it's...been a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: Hmm, headaches with sweating and a racing heart... that certainly sounds unpleasant. Okay, let’s try to piece this together a bit. You said "on and off for a while now." Can you give me a rough idea – are we talking weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, unpleasant is… a good way to put it. Let me think… Months, I think. Definitely months. Maybe… six? Longer? It’s hard to say, honestly. Things kinda blur together, you know? I don’t keep track of stuff like that too well. It's not every day, thankfully. More like… a few times a month? Sometimes less.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have exact dates. "A few times a month" gives us something to work with. And you said these headaches are strong – on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give them when they’re at their peak?
PATIENT: Oh, one to ten, yeah? Okay. Hmm… When they’re bad… I’d say an eight, maybe even a nine. Really bad. Like, it feels like someone’s squeezing my head in a vise, almost. Makes it hard to think straight, you know? And then the sweating starts, and… well, it’s not fun. Definitely not fun. It makes me kinda shaky too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight to nine out of ten, squeezing pain, with shaking and sweating. That sounds quite debilitating. And is the pain localized to a specific part of your head, or is it more general?
PATIENT: Ugh, general, I think. It's not like… just my temples, or the back of my head. It feels like it's all over, kinda. Sometimes it feels worse in my forehead, but other times it’s more on the sides. It's hard to pinpoint, really. Like a really tight band around my whole head, squeezing. Does that make sense? It kinda moves around too, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A tight band that moves around… Alright. And when these headaches start, do you notice anything that triggers them?
PATIENT: Triggers? Uh… honestly? Not really. That’s the frustrating part. I’ve tried to think about it, you know? Like, is it stress? Is it what I eat? But nothing seems to be consistent. Sometimes it happens when I’m tired, but other times I’m perfectly rested and it still hits. It just… comes on. I wish I knew something that caused it, so I could avoid it, you know? It’s just random, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Random events are always harder to track down. Okay, let’s switch gears a little bit. Besides the headaches, sweating and racing heart, have you noticed any other symptoms happening at the same time, or shortly after these episodes?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think… Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I’m gonna be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. And I get really sensitive to light, you know? Like, bright lights bother me a lot when I’m having one of these episodes. Everything seems extra bright and harsh. And… I think I get a bit dizzy too, sometimes, but that might just be from the headache, honestly. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright, nausea, light sensitivity and dizziness alongside the headache, sweating and racing heart. That's helpful. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in vision…? Uh… Not that I've noticed, no. I mean, I wear glasses, I’ve worn them for years, so I just see things blurry if I don’t have them on. But I haven't noticed anything different with my vision lately. No spots, no double vision, nothing like that. Just… regular blurry without my glasses. Does that make sense? I haven’t had my eyes checked in… a while, though. Probably should get that done, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Regular blurry without glasses is what we'd expect. It’s good you acknowledge needing an eye exam, we can definitely add that to the list. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh… medical history… Yeah, that's… a bit of a mess, to be honest. I haven’t really been to the doctor much over the years. Let me think… I was diagnosed with… mild asthma as a kid, but I haven’t had any problems with that in years. And I broke my arm once, when I was little, but that’s it. I don’t really remember anything else. Honestly, I don't think I've got anything major wrong with me. Just… these headaches. I got divorced a few years ago, does that count as a medical condition? I’m kidding, of course. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Divorce is certainly stressful, but I wouldn't classify that as a medical condition! Mild asthma in childhood, that's good to know. And no other significant medical diagnoses. Okay, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm when I was a kid, and they just put it in a cast. No cutting or anything like that. I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I avoid them whenever possible. Which is probably why I haven't really been to the doctor much, now that I think about it. It’s a vicious cycle. But I’m here now, so that’s something.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – no surgeries. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of headaches, migraines, heart problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Ugh… family history… hmm. My mom used to get headaches sometimes, pretty bad ones, but I don't think she ever went to the doctor about them. Just kinda suffered through them. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And his heart wasn’t great when he got older. He passed away a few years ago. And my brother is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. Honestly, I don't really talk to my family much, so I don’t know a ton about their medical stuff. It’s… complicated. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. Complicated family dynamics are common. Okay, so mother with headaches, father with high blood pressure and heart issues. That's useful information. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, lifestyle questions… Right. No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was younger, didn’t like it. I drink sometimes. A few beers on the weekend, maybe a glass of wine with dinner. Nothing crazy. And no, I don't use any recreational drugs. Definitely not. I’m not really into all that stuff. Pretty boring, actually. I mostly just… work and watch TV, to be honest. Not a very exciting life, I know. But it’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use, no smoking or recreational drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh… allergies… Let me think… Nope, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I remember. I’m allergic to cats, but that's about it. I steer clear of them whenever possible. And I get itchy when I get stung by bees, but that's just a normal reaction, I think. Nothing serious. Mostly, I’m pretty good. I haven’t got too many allergies, thankfully. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medication allergies, cat allergy, and a typical reaction to bee stings. That's good to know. Alright, Jaxston, we’ve covered a lot. Let me just quickly recap: you're a 22-year-old male experiencing headaches, sometimes accompanied by sweating, a racing heart, nausea, and light sensitivity. They’ve been happening for months, a few times a month, with a pain level of 8-9 out of 10. You've had mild asthma in childhood, no surgeries, a family history of headaches and heart problems, and occasional alcohol use. No known medication allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… yeah, that sounds good. That’s alright with me. Listen to my heart and lungs, check my blood pressure, the whole thing. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I’m not great with needles. And… I’m kinda nervous, to be honest. But I’m trusting you, Doctor. I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go along. No needles today, I promise. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not drastically high, but something to keep an eye on. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or anything concerning. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and basic neurological function. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll test your strength and coordination. Just simple things. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, I can do that. Follow your finger… easy enough. Is that okay? Am I doing it right? I get kinda nervous when people look at me, so it's hard to concentrate sometimes. Just let me know if I’m doing something wrong. I'm trying my best to cooperate. It’s just… all this poking and prodding is kinda making me anxious. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Jaxston. Perfectly fine. No need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious during a physical exam. Your eye movements are normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Is that good? Is it too tight? I don't want to break anything. I'm kinda worried I'm not strong enough. I don't do a lot of physical stuff, you know? Mostly just… sitting at a desk. Sorry if I'm disappointing you.
DOCTOR: No, that was perfectly fine. Your grip strength is within a normal range. Now, let’s just test your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. I’m going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. It’s just to check your nerves. And… okay, that was normal. Both sides reacted as expected. Alright, Jaxston, the physical exam is complete. Everything appears within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Based on your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing tension headaches, possibly with some accompanying symptoms like sweating and a racing heart. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Given your elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, I think an EKG would be a good idea to check your heart function, given your occasional racing heart. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work and an EKG…? That sounds… kinda serious, doesn’t it? I mean, I was just hoping it was something simple, like stress or something. I’m not a fan of needles, as you know, and… I get kinda claustrophobic in those machines, I think. But… yeah, okay. If you think it's necessary, then I guess so. I just… I’m really hoping you can figure out what’s going on and make it stop. I’m tired of feeling like this all the time. Can you tell me… what are you looking for exactly? Is it something really bad? Sorry, I’m just… anxious. Again. It's just all a bit overwhelming, you know?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Jaxston. And you're right, it is a bit overwhelming. We’re not necessarily looking for anything "bad," but it's important to be thorough and rule out any potential underlying causes. The blood work will check your basic organ function, electrolyte levels, and inflammation markers. It will give us a broader picture of your overall health. The EKG will check your heart’s electrical activity and identify any irregularities. Think of it as gathering information, so we can get to the bottom of this and come up with the best plan for you. We're not jumping to conclusions, we're just being cautious. The blood draw will just be a small sample from your arm, and the EKG is a non-invasive test where we place some stickers on your chest. It doesn't hurt at all. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. No insurance. That's… kinda why I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. It's expensive. I’m divorced, and… things are tight. Is that gonna be a problem? I don’t really have a lot of money to spend on… all this. Sorry. I didn’t mean to bring that up. I just… I’m worried about the cost. Is there any way to… get help with that? Maybe a payment plan or something? I’m really hoping this isn’t gonna bankrupt me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jaxston. Healthcare costs can be very daunting, especially without insurance. We absolutely can discuss payment options and see what we can do to make this manageable. Let me check with our billing department to see if we have any financial assistance programs or sliding scale options available. We also have a social worker who can help you navigate available resources. We'll work with you to find a solution that fits your budget. Don’t worry about that right now. Let's focus on getting the tests ordered, and then we'll tackle the financial aspect together. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah. Okay, go ahead and order them. I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? I just… need to figure out what's going on. And hopefully it's not something really bad. And hopefully I can afford it. Just… let me know when and where I need to go for the tests, okay? And… can you write down the instructions for me? I’m kinda forgetful, as you know. And… can you please be patient with me if I ask a lot of questions? I just… get nervous and confused easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. No problem at all. I'll write everything down for you, including detailed instructions for the tests and the contact information for the lab and EKG department. I’ll also include my contact information, so you can reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don't hesitate to ask as many questions as you need. That’s what I’m here for. Here you go. This outlines everything. You can go to the lab at any time during their business hours, and the EKG department is located on the third floor of this building. They'll need a copy of this form. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh, emergency room… great. Okay, um… no, I don't think so. Not right now. I think I just need to… process everything. And… try not to panic. Thank you, Doctor. Really. For being patient with me. And for writing everything down. I appreciate it. Just… hopefully everything will be okay. And hopefully I can afford it. And hopefully it's not something really bad. Sorry, I keep repeating myself. I just… I'm really nervous. Is it okay if I just… go now? I just want to go home and… think about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. That's perfectly fine. You go home and take care of yourself. Don't worry about repeating yourself – it's completely understandable to be anxious. And remember, we’ll work through this together. If anything comes up, or if you just want to talk, please don't hesitate to call. Here’s my card. Take your time, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
