DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. The office sent me a letter, said my numbers weren’t quite right. Something about cholesterol, I think? My wife always handled the medical stuff, you see. She passed a few years back, and I’m a bit lost with all this now.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I see. Your primary care physician ordered some bloodwork recently, and it does show your cholesterol is elevated. It's very common, especially as we get older. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed with managing these things on your own now. Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out together. Just to be clear, do you remember when you had those blood tests done?
PATIENT: Let me think... it was… oh, goodness. About a month ago, maybe a little more? The lady at the lab was very kind, helped me fill out the paperwork. It was at that new place over by the grocery store. I went on a Tuesday, I believe. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Okay, I see the results from July 12th. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160, your HDL is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. Now, those numbers… they aren’t ideal. We want to get those LDL numbers down. Before we jump into talking about medications, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you have a regular diet?
PATIENT: Oh my, all those numbers… sounds complicated! I try to eat okay, I suppose. I mostly eat what I’ve always eaten, to be honest. A lot of potatoes, some fish when I can get it, and… well, my wife always made a good meatloaf. I still make it sometimes, keeps her memory alive, you know? I don't really follow a diet, if that's what you mean. I used to be a farmer, so I always ate hearty portions. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Bohnett. But a traditional farmer’s diet—hearty portions, potatoes, meat—tends to be higher in saturated fat and cholesterol, which can contribute to elevated levels. Let’s talk about exercise. Do you do any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Exercise… not like I used to. When I was farming, I was always on the go! But since I retired, and… well, since my wife passed, I mostly just take short walks around the yard. Not every day, mind you. My knees aren't what they used to be. It's a bit of a struggle, to be honest. I used to enjoy fishing, but it's hard to get out there on my own now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you're doing some walking, though. Any amount of activity is helpful. And it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to maintain hobbies when you're grieving and dealing with physical limitations. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it gave him a terrible cough. I swore off them when I was just a boy, and never looked back. Always believed fresh air was the best medicine, and still do, even if it’s just a little bit around the yard. Is that good, at least? I feel like I’m doing something right, even if the numbers aren’t what they should be.
DOCTOR: That is good, Mr. Bohnett. Very good. Avoiding smoking is a huge positive. Alright, let's talk about family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had heart problems, high cholesterol, or a stroke?
PATIENT: Let me think... My mother, she had high blood pressure, I recall. Had to take pills for it for years. And my father... well, he died young, a heart attack when he was only 62. That scared me something awful, even as a boy. My older brother, he was healthy as a horse, never a sick day in his life. But my sister... she had a stroke about ten years ago, ended up in a wheelchair. So, yeah, there's a bit of heart trouble on both sides of the family, it seems. Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly does. That family history is… relevant. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my arthritis, helps with the stiffness in my hands. That’s it. Nothing for my heart, nothing for blood pressure. Just the one little arthritis pill. Been taking it for a few years now, doesn't seem to do much good anymore, to be honest. But the doctor said I should keep taking it, so I do. Is that something I need to tell you about? The arthritis, I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good to know everything you’re taking, even if it seems minor. What's the name of that arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me see if I can remember. It’s a little white pill… the bottle says… Naproxen, that's it! Naproxen. 220 milligrams, I take one twice a day. I think it helps a little, but not as much as it used to. My hands still ache something awful, especially in the mornings. But it’s alright, I manage. I’ve lived with it for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen 220mg twice a day. Good. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, I think I have a good picture of your situation now. Given your family history, your cholesterol levels, and your lifestyle, we need to take this seriously. We could try some dietary changes and increased exercise, but with your age and family history, I think medication is likely the best course of action. I'm thinking a statin would be appropriate. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A statin…? Sounds… serious. Is that one of those pills you take for the rest of your life? I don’t really like the idea of taking more pills, honestly. Especially if they don't make much difference. Are there any… side effects? I’ve heard stories about those. I’m not sure I understand what a statin even does, to be honest. Maybe you could explain it to me like you would explain it to my wife? She always knew what was going on with my health, and I always trusted her judgment. This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, Mr. Bohnett. It's perfectly reasonable to be hesitant, and it's good that you want to understand everything. A statin is a medication that helps lower your cholesterol, specifically the LDL – the “bad” cholesterol. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol your liver produces. And yes, you typically take statins long-term, to keep your cholesterol levels in check. As for side effects, they are possible, but most people tolerate them very well. The most common ones are muscle aches and pains, but that’s relatively rare, and we can monitor you closely for that. There’s also a very small risk of liver problems, which is why we’ll do blood tests periodically to check your liver function. We wouldn’t start you on a statin unless we felt the benefits outweighed the risks, and we'd start with a low dose to see how you tolerate it. I want to assure you, Mr. Bohnett, we'll work together to manage this and make sure you're comfortable. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what high cholesterol does, and why lowering it is important?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I always understood my wife to say it was about keeping my arteries clear, but I never really paid much attention to the details. I suppose I just trusted her to take care of it. Can you explain it to me like… like it was a plumbing problem? She always said I understood things better when she explained them that way. She had a way with words, my wife did.
DOCTOR: Your wife sounds like a wonderful woman. A plumbing analogy is perfect. Think of your arteries like pipes, carrying blood throughout your body. Cholesterol is like… well, it's like grease. A little bit of grease is fine, keeps things moving. But over time, too much grease builds up inside the pipes, narrowing them and making it harder for the blood to flow. That's what we call plaque. When the plaque builds up, it restricts blood flow to your heart and other organs. That can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and eventually, a heart attack or stroke. A statin works like a drain cleaner, helping to remove some of that built-up plaque and prevent more from forming. It doesn't fix the problem overnight, but it can significantly reduce your risk of serious complications. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a lot of sense, actually. A drain cleaner! She would have liked that analogy. So, the statin would… help keep the pipes clear? And it’s better to do it now, before… before things get really bad? I don’t want to end up like my father, if I can help it. He was such a young man when he… when he passed.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It helps keep the pipes clear and prevents more buildup. And yes, it's always better to address these things proactively. The earlier we start, the better the chance of preventing serious problems. Your father's situation is a good reminder of why we need to take this seriously. Now, there are a few different types of statins. I'm thinking we'll start with Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day. It's generally well-tolerated, and we can adjust the dose if needed. We'll also need to do some blood tests to check your cholesterol levels and liver function before we start, and again in a few months to see how you're responding. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Atorvastatin… 10 milligrams. Okay. Blood tests… more blood tests. It’s a bit of a bother, but if it keeps the pipes clear, like you said… and it might help me avoid ending up like my father… then yes, I suppose so. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What do I need to do now? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And will this interfere with my arthritis pill? I take that every day, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that. We'll schedule a blood draw for next week – I’ll have the receptionist arrange that for you. The results typically take a few days. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and start the Atorvastatin, if everything looks good. And no, Atorvastatin doesn’t typically interfere with Naproxen, your arthritis medication. But it’s always good to keep me informed of any changes or side effects you experience. We will review all your current medications at the follow-up appointment to be absolutely sure. For now, just continue taking your arthritis pill as you normally do. We’ll also discuss some lifestyle changes – focusing on a heart-healthy diet and gentle exercise – at the next appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Blood tests next week, follow-up appointment… and we’ll talk about diet and exercise. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It's a relief to have someone to talk to about this. My wife would have liked you very much, I think. She always said a good doctor was worth their weight in gold. I think she was right. Thank you again. I believe that’s all for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It’s my pleasure. And your wife sounded like a remarkable woman. Yes, that’s all for today. The receptionist will schedule those appointments for you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
