DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lilyanna. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet, you see. A bit like… balancing is harder than it used to be. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe. Though, to be honest, the timing escapes me.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady on your feet. I understand. And you said “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. Let me think… It feels like… perhaps a few months? Maybe longer? It's hard to be certain. Things haven’t been… clear, lately. I apologize for the vagueness. It just… isn't coming to me easily.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright. We'll figure it out together. A few months, okay. Has this unsteadiness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It seems to… fluctuate, Doctor. Some days it’s barely noticeable – I might just feel a little clumsy. Other days… well, other days it’s quite pronounced. I’ve nearly fallen a couple of times, though thankfully I haven’t yet. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, as far as I can tell. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. So fluctuating, more noticeable on some days, and no obvious triggers. Have you noticed anything with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: With it… hmm. That’s a good question. Sometimes… a little dizziness, perhaps? Not a full spin, more like a lightness in my head. And… occasionally, a bit of nausea, but not always. It’s all rather… fragmented. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more precise. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Lilyanna, thank you. Lightheadedness and occasional nausea along with the unsteadiness. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… that’s… I don’t believe so. I haven't been to the optometrist recently, so I can’t say for certain. Everything looks normal, as far as I can tell. Though, I do find myself needing to concentrate more to read small print. But that could simply be… age, perhaps? I'm not certain it’s connected to the unsteadiness, but you asked, and I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes in vision, just a slight difficulty with small print. And you're 23, so that's less likely to be a major factor. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you had any headaches with this?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not severe, mind you. More of a dull ache, usually at the back of my head. They come and go, like everything else. I hadn’t thought to mention them before, as they don’t seem directly connected to the… imbalance. But you’re asking, and I want to be thorough. Is that… useful information? I apologize again for the disjointed nature of my explanations.
DOCTOR: It is useful, Lilyanna, please don’t apologize. Dull headaches at the back of your head. Okay. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, or any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… No, I don't believe so. My hearing feels… normal. I haven’t noticed any difficulty hearing conversations, or anything like that. Though, I do work around a lot of machinery at the oil rig, so there is noise. Perhaps it’s masked something? But no, I haven’t consciously noticed any ringing, or hearing loss. I hope that answers your question, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ringing in the ears or hearing loss. You work around machinery at an oil rig. That's good to know. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… I had a rather unpleasant cold a few months back, I think. It was shortly before the unsteadiness started, perhaps? It was a bad one, kept me in bed for several days. But I recovered fully, or so I thought. Could that be… related? It feels distant, I'm afraid. My memory is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It could be related. A recent cold a few months ago. Alright. And have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fevers… chills… No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t felt unwell enough to check my temperature, or anything of that nature. I haven’t experienced any night sweats, either. I sleep… normally, as far as I can recall. I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s frustrating for me as well, trying to recall these things. Is there a way to… jog my memory? Perhaps a list of questions?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. We’ll take it slow. A list of questions is a good idea. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… That’s a difficult one. No, not a sudden, noticeable weakness. But… sometimes, after a long shift at the rig, my legs feel… heavy. Like they’re tired, more than weak. It’s not constant, though. And it goes away with rest. Is that… what you’re asking about? I apologize. I find it difficult to describe these sensations accurately.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness in legs after work. That is helpful. Have you had any problems with coordination, like difficulty writing, buttoning your clothes, or walking heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Coordination… Hmm. I hadn’t consciously noticed any difficulty writing, or buttoning my clothes. Though… I suppose I haven’t paid much attention. Walking… sometimes I stumble, but I attributed that to fatigue, or uneven ground. Now that you mention it, perhaps it’s more than that? It's difficult to say. I apologize. I’m afraid my observations are rather imprecise. This is frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help you understand?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. You're doing fine. Okay, stumbling. Let’s move onto your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… That’s… difficult. My husband… he handled all of that. He passed away just over a year ago, you see. And… I haven’t really had a chance to… sort through everything. I know I had… chickenpox as a child. And… a broken arm, once. But nothing… serious, as far as I recall. I had regular check-ups with him, though. Is there a way to access those records? I apologize for the vagueness. I feel terrible not being able to provide more information.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m seeing some records here from your previous physician. It looks like you were treated for a mild case of anemia a few years ago, and also had some routine vaccinations. Nothing else major. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Anemia… vaccinations… That rings a faint bell, yes. My husband was very diligent about those things. And… no, I’m not currently taking any medications. I haven’t needed anything, until now, I suppose. I take a multivitamin, occasionally, but that’s all. I apologize. It feels like I’m grasping at straws, trying to recall things. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, just occasional multivitamins. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never experienced any allergic reactions. My husband always made sure to ask before I tried anything new. He was very cautious. I apologize for repeating myself, but it feels like my memory is… fragmented. This is frustrating. Is it alright if I take a moment? I feel a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. Take your time. It’s alright to pause and collect your thoughts. We can take as long as you need. Just let me know when you're ready to continue. I have a pen and paper here if it helps to write things down.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. A pen and paper might help, yes. It’s just… everything feels a little distant. It's difficult to focus. I apologize. This is… unsettling. I'm ready to continue when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. I think. It’s… hazy. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… arthritis, perhaps? I apologize. This is all so imprecise. My family isn’t… close. I didn’t see them often. I'm trying, Doctor, but it’s… difficult. I’m afraid my memory is not what it used to be. Is this helpful at all?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Lilyanna. Don’t worry about being precise. High blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis in the family – that gives me something to work with. Now, a couple of more questions, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never smoked. I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. My husband… he didn't approve. And I… I haven't felt the need. I apologize. Is that… satisfactory? This feels like a very personal line of questioning, and I apologize if I seem… evasive. I'm just trying to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly satisfactory, Lilyanna. And you are not being evasive at all. These questions are simply part of a routine medical assessment. Alright. Now, before we move to the physical exam, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I work on an oil rig, out in the… well, I don't recall the exact location. It's quite physically demanding. I operate a rotary drill, mostly. It’s… a lot of heavy lifting, and long hours. I've been doing it for… about a year, now, I think. It’s… how I've been supporting myself since my husband passed. It's… lonely work. And very loud. I apologize. I'm rambling, aren’t I? Is this relevant? I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Lilyanna. The physical demands and noise exposure are important factors. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also check your balance and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. Though, I'm a little worried about the balance test. I’ve been feeling so unsteady lately. But… if it’s necessary, then… yes. Please be gentle, if you would. I apologize for being… difficult. I just… I don’t like feeling this vulnerable. But I trust your expertise. Let's… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat on the table. We'll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. First, let’s just get your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, and your pulse is 72. That’s within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… a little difficult. I need to… hold on. I apologize. I told you I was unsteady. Please… be careful. I'm… I'm afraid I'm going to fall.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lilyanna. I’ve got you. Just take your time. I’m right here. Now, can you try standing with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes… I’m trying. Oh dear… it’s… very difficult. I feel… dizzy. Please… don’t let me fall. I… I think I’m going to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s enough. Sit down, sit down. Just breathe deeply. . You're pale, and a bit shaky. . I'm going to pause the exam for a moment. It appears you're experiencing significant instability and dizziness. I’m concerned. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Yes… please. I… I knew something was wrong. But I didn't want to… bother you. I apologize. I just… I'm so tired of feeling this way. What… what’s wrong with me, Doctor? What do we need to do? I trust you… please help me.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. You haven’t bothered me at all. It’s my job to help you, and that’s what I’m going to do. Based on your symptoms – the unsteadiness, dizziness, and now this significant instability – I suspect we need to rule out a few things. It could be related to your inner ear, your blood pressure, or potentially something neurological. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. I want to get a complete blood count, check your electrolytes, and get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I just want to know what’s wrong. I want to be able to… function again. I need to be able to work. An MRI… will that be… painful? I’ve never had one before. And… will it show something bad? I apologize. I’m… I’m getting worked up. But I'm so scared. What if… what if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be scared, Lilyanna. It's natural to feel anxious when facing the unknown. An MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s a bit loud, but we can provide you with earplugs. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the process. As for what it will show, we don’t know yet. That’s why we need to do the tests. It could be something simple, or it could be something more complex. But we'll rule out all possibilities to get to the bottom of this. I want to be upfront with you, Lilyanna. Given your symptoms and this level of instability, there is a possibility that something serious is going on. But we're going to investigate thoroughly, and we'll develop a treatment plan based on the results. I'm here with you every step of the way. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help with the dizziness. It’s called meclizine, and it can help to relieve some of the nausea and vertigo. I'm also going to recommend that you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have the results of the tests. And I want you to come back to see me as soon as possible if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Not right now. Everything is… a lot to process. Thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for… not dismissing my concerns. It means a lot. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. And I hope I can get back to work soon. I don't know what else to do. What… what happens next? Do I need to schedule the tests now? And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I'm scared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions, Lilyanna, not at all. It’s good to be informed. Yes, let’s schedule the tests now. I have a nurse who can assist you with that. She’ll get you an appointment for the MRI and blood work as soon as possible. Depending on availability, we can usually get these done within a few days. The results typically take about 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible, and avoid any activities that make your dizziness worse. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms change. We're here to support you. I also want to refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion. It’s always good to have another set of eyes on these things. My nurse can also assist you with that. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I just… I don’t know what I would do without your help. I hope it's nothing serious. And I hope I can get back to work soon. I think I'll just… go home now. And rest. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. And you absolutely can get through this. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, anytime. Let's get you home safely. And please, rest. Take care of yourself.
