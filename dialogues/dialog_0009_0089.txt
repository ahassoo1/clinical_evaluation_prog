DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Oh, dear. What does bring me in… Now, let me see. It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been rather… troublesome. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… a condition? Lupus, was it? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. Lower abdominal pain that’s been coming and going, and you believe a previous physician may have mentioned Lupus. That's helpful. To clarify, when did you first start noticing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The first time… That’s a difficult question. It feels like a very long time ago. Perhaps… a year? Maybe longer. It started as just a little discomfort, really. Not enough to bother me much. But it’s been getting… sharper, and more frequent, these past few months. I truly can't recall an exact date, I'm sorry. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It’s common to not remember exact dates when it comes to things like this. We'll figure it out. So, this pain has been gradually worsening over the last few months. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It is a relief to hear you say that. Now… the pain. Hmm. It’s… a cramping sort of feeling, mostly. Like a tight band around my lower belly. Sometimes it feels like a dull ache, and other times it’s quite sharp, almost like… stabbing. It comes in waves, you see? And it radiates… down into my hips, a little. It’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant, at times. It makes it difficult to… to get comfortable, let alone do much of anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, a tight band sensation, sometimes sharp and stabbing, radiating to your hips. Comes in waves and makes it difficult to get comfortable. And when you say “waves,” how long do these episodes of pain typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, the waves… That varies, I think. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes, and then it fades away. Other times… it can last for hours. Perhaps two or three hours, or even longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. It seems to depend… on what I’ve been doing, perhaps? Or maybe just… random chance. Honestly, I wish I knew what triggered it. It’s all rather frustrating. I do remember one particularly bad episode… last week, I believe it was… but again, the dates are fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Glymph. It's certainly difficult when the pain is unpredictable. So, episodes lasting from a few minutes to several hours, with no clear trigger that you’ve identified. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… Hmm. Warm baths sometimes help, I believe. A nice, long soak in warm water seems to ease the cramping a little. And… lying down, very still, with a warm compress on my abdomen. That provides some relief, too. Not a complete cure, mind you, but it takes the edge off. And… distraction. If I can get my mind off the pain, it doesn’t seem quite so bad. Reading, perhaps, or listening to music. Though, on particularly bad days, even those things don’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm baths, lying down with a warm compress, and distraction can provide some relief. That's helpful to know. Now, besides the pain, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Let me see… Well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, you understand. And… achy. My joints ache, sometimes. Especially in my hands and knees. And I've noticed some… rashes, on occasion. Small, red spots, mostly on my face and arms. They come and go, like the pain. I hadn’t thought much of them, to be honest. I assumed it was just… my age. But perhaps they're related? I truly am not certain. My appetite hasn’t been very good either, I suppose. I don’t feel hungry as often as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, joint aches in your hands and knees, intermittent rashes on your face and arms, and decreased appetite. Those are all important things to note. Now, have you had a fever recently?
PATIENT: Oh, a fever… Hmm. Now that you mention it, I did feel a little warm a few days ago. Not a high fever, mind you. Just a slight temperature. I didn't bother to take my temperature, though. I just felt a little… under the weather. It passed quickly, so I didn't think much of it. No chills or sweats, thankfully. Just a general feeling of being… unwell. It’s been a few days now, and I haven’t felt that way since. But it might be worth mentioning, I suppose. It’s all rather confusing, isn’t it? So many little things happening… and I can't seem to keep track of it all.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to keep track of, Ms. Glymph, and you're doing a great job. A slight temperature a few days ago is helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, as I mentioned earlier, my previous physician did mention something about… lupus. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I believe it was called. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall all the details. I had some blood tests and… other tests, I suppose. And I was given some medication. But it wasn’t terribly effective, so I stopped taking it after a while. And… I've had high blood pressure for many years. I take medication for that. And… oh, what else? I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. I suppose that's all… although my memory is rather unreliable, so I might be forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Let me just pull up your records here… Yes, I see a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus from approximately 8 years ago, managed by Dr. Eleanor Vance. It looks like you were on hydroxychloroquine at that time. I also see a history of hypertension and a cholecystectomy. And you mentioned you were still taking medication for the blood pressure – can you tell me which medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, you have all that information! It’s such a relief not to have to rely on my poor memory. Let me see… the medication for my blood pressure… It’s… lisinopril, I believe. Yes, that’s right. And the dosage is… 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with breakfast. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, many years now. It seems to keep things under control, thankfully. Though, sometimes my blood pressure does get a little high, even with the medication. But nothing too serious, usually. Dr. Vance used to monitor it regularly, of course. But I haven’t seen her in quite some time. It’s been… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 20mg daily. I see your last visit with Dr. Vance was approximately five years ago. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I can tolerate most medications without any problems. And I can eat just about anything. Though, I do try to avoid overly processed foods, for health reasons. But that's just a personal preference, not an allergy. No, I don’t have any known allergies. I might get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that's just seasonal allergies, I suppose. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me see. My mother had arthritis, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? She suffered with it for many years. And my father had… heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was quite young, and he passed away a few years later. And… my sister has diabetes, I think. Type 2 diabetes, perhaps. She’s been managing it with medication and diet. And… that’s about all I can recall, I’m afraid. My family isn’t terribly large, and we don’t keep in close contact. So, I don’t know much about their medical history. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so unhelpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You've given me a good amount of information. History of rheumatoid arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and Type 2 diabetes in your sister. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Let me think. Well, I live alone. I’ve never married. I enjoy reading, and listening to music. And I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. I retired from my job as a ship engineer a few years ago. It was a demanding job, but I enjoyed it. And… that’s about it. I don’t have many close friends, but I have a few acquaintances. I try to stay active, but it’s difficult sometimes with the pain. I spend most of my time at home, these days. It's a quiet life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That gives me a very good understanding of your background. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. We'll start with your vital signs, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgement completely. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s just… I do hope you can find out what’s causing all this pain. It’s been rather debilitating, and I’m eager to get it under control. But please don’t rush. Take your time, and let me know if you need any further information. I’ll do my best to answer your questions, even if my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. I will certainly take my time. First, let’s check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. And your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's examine your abdomen. I’m noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. There are no palpable masses. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some guarding present. It appears the pain is more pronounced with palpation.
PATIENT: Oh, that does sound… concerning, doesn’t it? The tenderness in my lower abdomen is nothing new, of course. That’s where the pain is located, as I mentioned earlier. But the guarding… I hadn’t noticed that before. It’s good you’re paying attention to those details, Doctor. I do feel a bit more discomfort when you press on my abdomen, but it’s difficult to say if it’s any worse than usual. My pain tolerance isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. But it's reassuring to know you're being thorough. What do you think it could be? Is it related to the lupus? Or something else entirely? I’m a little anxious, to be honest. It’s never a good sign when something feels… different.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph. It's never comfortable when something feels different. Based on what you've told me and my examination findings, several possibilities come to mind. Given your history of lupus, a flare-up is certainly a consideration. Lupus can affect many different organs, and abdominal pain is a common symptom. However, the tenderness and guarding could also indicate other issues, such as diverticulitis, an intestinal infection, or even a problem with your ovaries or uterus. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will check for signs of inflammation, infection, and organ function. The CT scan will provide a more detailed image of your abdominal organs and help us identify any abnormalities. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… quite sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a CT scan. Yes, absolutely. If it will help determine the cause of this pain, then I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgement completely. A CT scan sounds a little… intimidating, but if it’s necessary, then so be it. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and find a way to alleviate the pain. And hopefully, it’s not something too serious. A flare-up of the lupus sounds… manageable, perhaps. But something more serious… that’s what I’m worried about. What is the next step? Will someone contact me to schedule the tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I’m just a little… apprehensive.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be apprehensive, Ms. Glymph, and please, don't apologize for the questions – it's important for you to understand everything that's happening. My nurse, Sarah, will contact you shortly to schedule the blood work and the CT scan. The blood work can usually be done within a day or two. The CT scan may take a bit longer to schedule, depending on availability, but we’ll get it done as quickly as possible. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Typically, blood work results come back within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan report takes a bit longer, usually 1-2 business days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or significant abdominal distension, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I’m glad to hear it will be done as quickly as possible. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. No, I don’t have any allergies to contrast dye, as far as I know. I haven’t had any procedures done that required contrast dye before, so I’ve never been exposed to it. But I will certainly let Sarah know if I recall anything differently when she contacts me. And thank you again for being so patient and understanding. It’s a relief to finally have someone taking my pain seriously. Now, is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? Or any specific symptoms I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. You can continue to take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as needed, but please be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label. As I mentioned earlier, it’s important to monitor for any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension. Also, if you notice any blood in your stool or urine, please contact me immediately. While we wait for the test results, try to stay hydrated and eat a bland diet. Avoid foods that may irritate your stomach, such as spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. I will also have my nurse send you some information on managing lupus flares. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… sensible, Doctor. Thank you. Rest, hydration, bland diet. Yes, I can manage that. And thank you for the information on managing lupus flares. That’s very thoughtful of you. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at this time. You’ve answered everything so thoroughly, and I feel much more informed and less anxious now. I’m grateful for your patience and understanding. I suppose I’ll just wait for Sarah to contact me and schedule the tests. And try to stay positive. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or you become concerned, don’t hesitate to contact the office. We’re here to support you. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you when we have the test results. Have a good day, and please take care.
