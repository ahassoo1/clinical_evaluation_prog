DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. I’m Neeraj Auelua, it’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. It's become a bit difficult, you see. Not painful, exactly, just… takes effort. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty with urination. And you said it takes effort… could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, how to explain… It's like I have to push a bit to get it started, and then it doesn't come out in a strong stream like it used to. More… dribbly, I suppose. And I feel like I don’t empty my bladder completely, even after I’m finished. Does that make sense? It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kandy. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. So, pushing to start, weak stream, dribbling, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… all for a couple of weeks now. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have been getting up a little more often at night to go, maybe two or three times. I usually sleep right through, but lately… not so much. And no, no pain, like I said. Just… inconvenient. I don’t think anything else has changed, really. I’m pretty regular otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency at night – nocturia – and no pain, that's good. Do you have any trouble starting the stream at all, or is it just that it takes a bit of effort once you’re already going?
PATIENT: It’s not that I can't start at all, Doctor. It just doesn't happen right away. There's a little bit of waiting, and then I have to… well, bear down a little. It's not a strong urge, like it used to be, you see? More like… coaxing it to come out. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, not at all strange, Kandy. That’s a helpful way to describe it. It sounds like there’s some hesitancy and straining. Now, just to get a better picture, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or chills. And my back has been fine, thankfully. I had a little trouble with it a few years back, but it’s been good as gold since. I do a little gardening, you see, but I’m careful not to overdo it. No lower back pain at all, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any change in the color or smell of it?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Everything looks normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t noticed any change in the smell either. I drink plenty of water, you see, so it’s usually pretty clear. I always try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: That's good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Kandy?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. A little something for my blood pressure – lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a bit low last year. That’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure and vitamin D. Any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had one in my life, thankfully. My mother always said I was a sturdy child! No trouble with any food or anything in the garden, either. I can eat whatever I like, and I don't get bothered by pollen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, have you had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, that’s the only surgery I’ve ever had. And I was in the hospital for a week once with a bad bout of pneumonia, maybe twenty years ago. But other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I’ve always been careful about staying healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and pneumonia twenty years ago. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, particularly any related to the kidneys, bladder, or prostate – if any male relatives have had any prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My father had high blood pressure, like me, but nothing about the kidneys or bladder that I recall. My brother had some heart trouble, but again, nothing related to this. On my mother’s side… she had arthritis, but that’s about it. No prostate issues, no. My uncles were all pretty healthy men, as far as I know. I don’t think anyone had any trouble with their… waterworks, if you’ll pardon the expression. It’s hard to remember back that far, though.
DOCTOR: No worries, Kandy, that's perfectly alright. It is difficult to remember details. Alright. To get a clearer understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological check. And I'd like to do a simple urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. I trust your judgement. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm sure it's nothing too serious. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax, and I’ll guide you through everything. First, let’s have you lie back on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. It might be a little cool to the touch. Okay, your abdomen feels soft and non-tender. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Could you cross your legs and try to relax your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Here we go… It’s a little chilly, you’re right. But I'm alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m trying to relax my legs… it’s not always easy, you know, getting old! But I’m doing my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal. Now, we’ll just need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll show you how to collect a midstream sample. It’s important to clean the area first to avoid contamination. There’s a private restroom just down the hall. Take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. We'll send this off to the lab, and the results should be available within a few hours.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A urine sample. Yes, I can manage that. Midstream, you said? I remember that from… well, from somewhere! I’ll head off to the restroom now. It’ll just be a moment. I’ll let you know when I’m finished. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I’ll be right here when you get back.
