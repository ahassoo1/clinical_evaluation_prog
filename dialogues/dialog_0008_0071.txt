DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s about some paperwork I need to get sorted. A friend… a very good friend… is hoping to come visit from overseas, and I understand there are some shots required for a visa. I’m trying to make sure everything is in order before they start the process. It’s a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, visa paperwork. I see. So, it's not necessarily about you feeling unwell, but getting documentation for travel requirements for your friend. That makes sense. Let's start with this: do you know which vaccinations they're requesting?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t. That’s the confusing part. I received a list of things to check, and a form with spaces for… well, for medical information, I suppose. But it doesn’t say what vaccinations are needed. I figured you could tell me what’s generally required for someone coming to the States. They’re coming from… let me think… Ireland, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ireland… okay. Generally, for travel to the US, routine vaccinations are the biggest concern – things like tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella… Have you had those boosters in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Ten years… goodness. That’s a long time ago. I… honestly, I don’t recall. I used to keep good track of these things, after I retired from teaching, things got a little… disorganized. I’ve had a flu shot every year, religiously, but the others… I’m afraid I wouldn’t know. Is there a way to find out?
DOCTOR: We can certainly try to look up your records here. Do you happen to know where you typically receive your vaccinations?
PATIENT: Well, for the flu shots, I’ve been going to the pharmacy down the street – Miller’s Pharmacy. Before that… when my wife was still with us, we both went to Dr. Evans’ office. That was… oh, a good ten years ago, maybe more. They might have records there, but I haven't been back since… well, since she passed. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, Miller’s Pharmacy and Dr. Evans’ office. We'll start by trying to request records from both places. That might take a few days to process. In the meantime, to be safe, let's go ahead and review your vaccination history as best we can today. Have you ever had a tuberculosis test, or a chest x-ray?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. I was a teacher for a long time, of course, working with children, but I don't remember ever needing a TB test. They might have done something when I first started, but it was so long ago… I really couldn't say. Is that something I should have had regularly? I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering these details.
DOCTOR: It's understandable. It’s not always something required for everyone. We can do a quick skin test today, just to rule it out. It's a simple procedure. Also, have you ever had the varicella vaccine – that’s for chickenpox?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… Oh, yes. I had chickenpox when I was a boy. A terrible rash, I remember my mother tending to me with calamine lotion. I’ve never had a shot for it though. Back when I was a child, you just got chickenpox. No one thought about getting a shot for it. Would I need one now? It's all so different these days.
DOCTOR: Since you had chickenpox, you don't necessarily need the vaccine. However, it’s good to document that. Now, let's talk about your tetanus booster. When was the last time you received a tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Goodness… that’s a tough one. It was… well, it was after I retired, I think. Maybe five years ago? No, perhaps longer. I honestly can’t be sure. I remember getting one after I stepped on a nail in the garden, but… that was quite a while ago. I really wish I’d kept better track of these things. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Mr. Skarbek. These things happen. Given it’s been potentially longer than ten years since your last tetanus booster, I recommend we give you a booster shot today, along with the flu vaccine since it's that time of year. We can also document everything so you have a clear record. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Yes, that would be wonderful. Just to be on the safe side, you said? A booster and the flu shot. That would put my mind at ease, and make things easier for my friend, getting their visa sorted. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. We’ll get those administered shortly. Nurse Miller will be in to prep you in just a moment. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had a bad reaction to any vaccines in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. I've never had any trouble with medications or shots before, thankfully. A little soreness afterwards, perhaps, but nothing serious. Just the usual. I think I'm pretty good in that regard. I'm usually quite lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And just to confirm, you're here today primarily for these vaccinations to help facilitate your friend's visa process?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that is correct. That’s the main reason I came. Everything else is… well, a bonus, I suppose, to make sure I’m up-to-date. But yes, it’s about getting the paperwork right for my friend. They’re very excited about coming to visit, and I want to make sure there are no problems.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Nurse Miller will be right in to get you started. She’ll review everything with you one last time before the vaccinations. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Skarbek.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I feel much better already.
