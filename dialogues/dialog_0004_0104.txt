DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Just hurts to swallow. Been that way a few days now, I think. It’s very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. A sore throat, and it’s been bothering you for a few days. Inconvenient, yes, I understand. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well… it hurts. Like something is… rough. Scratchy, maybe? It’s not a sharp pain, if that makes sense. More… a constant bother. I don’t know what else to tell you. I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. “Rough” and “scratchy” are helpful. Is it painful to speak as well, or just to swallow?
PATIENT: Just swallowing, mostly. Talking is fine. Though I don’t like to shout, and I haven't been doing much of that lately. It’s just… unpleasant to swallow food. And water. Everything, really. It’s a nuisance. I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, pain primarily with swallowing, not speaking. And it's affecting your ability to eat and drink. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… no, not really. I might have coughed a little, but everyone coughs these days, don’t they? And a runny nose… perhaps? I don’t pay much attention to those things. Honestly, I just want something for my throat. I don't have time for a full illness.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re pressed for time, Ms. Ottaviani. However, it’s important to gather enough information to determine the best course of action. A cough can be relevant. Even if it’s minor. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils, if you can see them?
PATIENT: Pus? Goodness, no! I haven’t looked at my tonsils. Why would I? That sounds… unpleasant. I don’t poke around in my mouth. I just know my throat hurts and I need something for it. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do. Really important things.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick examination of your throat. It will only take a moment. Open wide, please, and say “Ah.” I’ll need to use a tongue depressor and a light.
PATIENT: A light? In my mouth? Doctor, I really don’t… I don't like that. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something for the pain without… poking around? I’m a busy woman.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, a proper examination is crucial to rule out more serious conditions. While I understand your time is valuable, prescribing medication without knowing the cause of your sore throat would be irresponsible. I need to visually assess your throat to determine the best treatment plan. It’s a quick procedure, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you absolutely refuse, I can offer supportive care advice, but I strongly advise against it. It is important to rule out strep throat.
PATIENT: Strep throat… Is that… serious? Look, I haven’t been feeling well, but I haven’t been sick. Just a sore throat. Fine. Fine, do your… examination. But be quick about it. And gentle, like you said. I don't want to make a mess. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your tonsils are red and a little swollen, but there’s no exudate. No visible pus. I don’t feel any significant swelling in your lymph nodes. Based on my examination, it’s likely a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat. However, without a strep test, we cannot completely rule out bacterial infection. Would you be willing to do a rapid strep test?
PATIENT: A test? More… poking? Doctor, honestly. I thought you said it was just a virus. Why do I need another test if it’s just a virus? I don’t understand. And I really, truly, don’t have time for this. Can’t you just give me something to soothe my throat and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, a rapid strep test is a quick swab of the throat to determine if Streptococcus bacteria are present. While I believe it's likely viral, a negative strep test would provide peace of mind and allow us to rule out needing antibiotics. If it is strep, antibiotics are crucial to prevent complications like rheumatic fever. It takes only a few minutes. It’s a standard procedure. If you decline the test, I will treat your symptoms, but I must advise you to return if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your test. Get it over with. But make it quick, and be gentle. I’m trusting you not to poke around too much. Honestly, this is a ridiculous amount of fuss over a sore throat. Just… get it done. And then give me something for the pain. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will take about five minutes. While we wait, can you tell me about any allergies you have to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I don't really keep track of those things. I haven't had any… serious reactions to anything. Maybe a little itching sometimes? I don't know. I just take what the pharmacist gives me, usually. I don't have time to memorize a list of allergies. I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll proceed with caution then. The test is negative for strep throat. That’s good news. It confirms my initial assessment of viral pharyngitis. We will treat your symptoms. I’m going to recommend a combination of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relief. You can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen as directed on the label. Lozenges or throat sprays can also help soothe your throat.
PATIENT: So, that’s it? Just rest and… lozenges? Honestly, I could have told you that myself. Is that all? I have things to do, you know. Important things. Can I get this prescription filled now? And can I get a note confirming I was here, in case I need it for work?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani. The prescription is ready for you to fill at the pharmacy. And I can certainly provide a note for your employer stating you were seen for a sore throat. Here you are. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash – please return immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Thank you. .
