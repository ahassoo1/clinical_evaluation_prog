DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time, Doctor… Donate, is it? I just… well, I want to have a baby. And I want it to be… easy. My first one was… complicated. I don’t want any trouble this time, you understand? I’m not getting any younger, and frankly, I'd like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Right. “Easy,” you say. Well, nobody can guarantee easy, Ms. Villarreal, but we can certainly try to make it as smooth as possible. Complicated how, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was just… everything. I was sick constantly. And then… the delivery. Let’s just say it wasn’t pleasant. Lots of… interventions. I don't remember all the details, to be honest, it was a while ago. I just want to avoid a repeat, if that makes sense. Is that possible? Can you… check to see if there’s anything wrong with me that would cause that again?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, and a difficult delivery requiring interventions. We can absolutely look into that. Let’s start with a bit more detail. When you say “sick constantly,” can you describe what you were experiencing?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was all day, every day. Couldn't keep anything down. Not water, not crackers, not even… well, you don’t need to know what I couldn't keep down. It was awful. I was just so weak. And then, later on... well, it ended up being a C-section. They said... something about the baby being… I don’t even remember. Look, it was stressful, okay? I’m not a medical person. Can we just skip the details and do some tests?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you wanting to get straight to tests, Ms. Villarreal, but a little more information helps me understand what we're looking for. And honestly, "skip the details" isn't really possible when trying to figure out why things were difficult last time. It's not about questioning your experience, it’s about being thorough. But alright, we can start with the nausea. How far along in the pregnancy did it start?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It started… pretty early, I think. Maybe six weeks? Or eight? I don’t really remember specifics, Doctor. It was a long time ago! It just… got worse and worse. And it didn't stop after the first trimester, like people say it's supposed to. It lasted the whole pregnancy. Honestly, I barely gained any weight. I felt terrible the entire nine months. Is that helpful? Can we please move on now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Severe and persistent nausea throughout the entire pregnancy, starting early. That's important. It sounds like you might have had hyperemesis gravidarum. We'll need to rule that out. Okay. Let’s switch gears. Any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hyper-what-now? Look, just tell me if there's something wrong with me, alright? I don’t need fancy names for things. As for medical conditions… not really. I had… high blood pressure for a little while, but that was years ago. It's controlled now with… a little pill. And… I think that’s it. I have private insurance, if that matters. I just want to be healthy enough to have a baby. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Villarreal. Hyperemesis gravidarum is severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy – much more intense than typical morning sickness. It can require hospitalization, and it's good we're looking into it. And yes, the high blood pressure does matter. What pill are you taking for it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s… a little white one. With a… I don’t know, a number on it? I honestly just take it every morning. My doctor… the old one… prescribed it. I don’t really pay attention to the names of things. Ugh, this is frustrating. Look, I’m busy, Doctor. Can’t someone just run some blood tests and tell me what’s wrong? I don't have time to play twenty questions about pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your frustration, but knowing the name of your medication is important. It helps me determine if it's safe to continue during pregnancy, and if it might have contributed to the issues you experienced last time. I’m going to access your EHR to see if we can find a record of it. It will take a moment. While I'm doing that, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that’s just… dust, probably. And I can't eat shellfish. Makes me break out in hives. Bad hives. That’s it. Hurry up, please. I have a meeting later. Honestly, this whole thing is taking forever. Is getting pregnant supposed to be this complicated? It wasn’t this hard for my mother.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal allergies, shellfish allergy. Noted. I’ve located a record of your blood pressure medication. It's Lisinopril. Now, Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, and it’s absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy. It can cause serious harm to the developing fetus. It's good we found this. This explains a lot. We'll need to switch you to a pregnancy-safe medication immediately. Before we do that, let's go over your past surgical history, if any. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh, Lisino-what-now? Look, I don’t understand any of this doctor-speak. It caused harm? Oh great. See? This is exactly what I was afraid of. Surgeries… um… yes. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And… a C-section, obviously, when I had my first baby. Is that all you need to know? Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Can we just get me on some new pills and get this pregnancy started? I don't have time for a whole medical history investigation. I have things to do. And I don’t want another C-section. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration, but rushing into a pregnancy without addressing these issues is not safe for you or your baby. The Lisinopril is a major concern, and we need to get that switched. The C-section also warrants discussion, as we need to understand why it was necessary to assess your risk factors. I am going to order a complete blood panel, a urine analysis, and an EKG. We will also schedule an ultrasound to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We'll also need to discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
