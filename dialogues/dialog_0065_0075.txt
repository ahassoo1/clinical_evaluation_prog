DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. It’s… persistent, even with the machine. I’ve been using it faithfully, I assure you, but I still find myself nodding off during the day. It’s not all the time, but enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The machine, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, the CPAP machine. My previous doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – diagnosed me with sleep apnea a few years back, and prescribed it. It helps at night, I sleep much better, don't snore anymore, my wife certainly appreciates that… but like I said, the tiredness during the day is still a problem. I just thought it was supposed to fix everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see Dr. Ramirez’s notes here. And you’ve been consistent with usage, according to the download data. That’s good. But simply using the machine isn’t always enough. We need to determine why you’re still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite treatment. Can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I used to teach at the university – Ethnic Studies, mostly. Retired now, though. I keep busy, thankfully. I wake up around 7, have some coffee with a little toast… try to get a bit of reading done, usually the newspaper. I volunteer at the local library a couple of afternoons a week, helping with the Spanish language section. And I try to get a walk in most days, weather permitting. The tiredness usually hits in the afternoon, after lunch. Sometimes I can fight it off with another cup of coffee, but other times… well, I just have to lie down for a bit. It's not like falling completely asleep, more like… a heavy drowsiness. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And how long has this daytime sleepiness been persistent despite using the CPAP?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… well, probably six months now, maybe a little longer. At first, I thought it was just me getting used to the machine, but it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s frustrating, honestly. I feel like I’m not fully… present, you know? When I’m with friends, or even just reading a book, I find myself drifting off, or having trouble concentrating. It's not a good feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned concentration issues. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes I get headaches, not terrible ones, more like a dull ache. And I’ve noticed my memory isn’t what it used to be – though, at my age, that’s probably not surprising! But it feels… worse than it should be, if you know what I mean. My wife keeps telling me I repeat myself, which is probably just old age again, but… yes, headaches and a bit of forgetfulness, I suppose. Oh, and I wake up with a dry mouth most mornings, even with the humidifier on the machine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dry mouth, headaches, memory issues… These could be related to the CPAP itself, or something else entirely. Have you had any changes in medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes in medications. I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, that’s it. Been on that for years, same dosage. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that’s just a general health thing. Nothing new at all, Doctor. I'm quite careful about keeping track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to rule out some possibilities. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, check your oxygen saturation… and I'd like to take a look at your throat, just to see if there's any irritation. It's possible the mask isn't fitting correctly, or there's some other issue with the CPAP setup itself. Can you remove your mask for a moment?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. I always make sure it's clean, you know. My wife reminds me constantly! It's a little uncomfortable sometimes, but I just figured that was part of the process. I'll be glad if we can figure out what's going on. It's just tiring being tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Oxygen saturation is good. Let me take a look at your throat. Hmm. Some mild redness at the back of the throat, but nothing significant. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. It doesn't appear to be anything obvious, physically. We need to look at the data from your CPAP machine more closely. And I think a sleep study might be necessary.
PATIENT: A sleep study? Oh dear. I had one before, to get the machine. Is it… will it be like that one? All those wires and things? I'm not a fan of hospitals, you know. But if it's what we need to do, I suppose I can manage. Is it possible the machine itself is faulty? Perhaps it's not working properly? I've been keeping the filter clean, and I make sure the hose isn't cracked… I just want to get this sorted out, Doctor. It's really affecting my quality of life.
DOCTOR: Yes, it would be similar to the previous study, unfortunately. It's the most accurate way to determine if the machine is delivering adequate pressure and if you're maintaining proper airflow throughout the night. It's possible the machine is malfunctioning, but we can't know for sure without the data. We will send you to a sleep lab, they will check the machine and ensure all is working properly. I'm going to order a repeat sleep study, with a focus on assessing your airway pressure and looking for any signs of leaks or obstructions. I'll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. And in the meantime, I want you to keep a sleep diary, documenting your bedtime, wake-up time, and any periods of daytime sleepiness.
PATIENT: Alright, a sleep study and blood work. And a diary… yes, I can do that. I used to keep very detailed notes when I was teaching, so a diary shouldn’t be too difficult. Do you have a form I can use for the diary, or is it just… whatever I write down? And about the sleep study… will I have to go to a special place? How long will it take? And will Medicare cover it? I worry about costs, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can print you a sleep diary form. It outlines the information we need. As for the sleep study, it will be at the Rural Sleep Center, about an hour's drive from here. It's a dedicated facility, so it's not a hospital environment. You'll be monitored overnight, hooked up to sensors. It typically takes about eight hours, including preparation time. And yes, Medicare should cover it, provided you meet the necessary criteria and we submit the appropriate documentation. I assure you, Mr. Paske, we'll handle the paperwork. We've dealt with Medicare many times. Don't worry about the details. Just focus on getting a good night's sleep, and keeping accurate records in your diary. We will schedule the study for you, and you will receive a call from the sleep center to confirm the date. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s… reassuring. Rural Sleep Center, you say? I’ll look them up online later. And you’ll handle the paperwork with Medicare… good, good. I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for ordering the tests. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Thank you very much. .
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll be in touch with the results. Have a good day.
