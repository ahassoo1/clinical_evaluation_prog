DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like…like it’s harder to get air, you see? I don’t like it one bit. I’d like to get this sorted out if possible, and not take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty breathing is certainly concerning. And I appreciate you being mindful of my time, though your health is the priority. Can you tell me a little more about this breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Well, it started…oh, maybe a month ago? I noticed it first when I was trying to read in bed. I usually lie flat with a pillow, but then it just…felt tight. Not a cough, not exactly…just hard. It doesn't happen when I'm sitting up, or even leaning back a bit. Only when I’m completely flat. I've tried different pillows, but nothing seems to help much. It wakes me up sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: So, it’s positional – meaning it's worse when lying flat – and has been happening for about a month. And it’s disrupting your sleep. That’s important to know. Now, besides the difficulty breathing when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms. Let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately, now that you mention it. Not terribly bad, but noticeable, especially at the end of the day. And I’ve been…a bit more tired than usual, even with a good night’s sleep…when I can get a good night’s sleep, that is. Does that make sense? I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely could be related. Swelling in the ankles and increased fatigue are both things we need to consider. Do you experience any chest pain, or any palpitations – a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And my heart…it feels normal, I think. It doesn’t race or flutter. It just…beats. Like it always does. I used to walk a good mile every day, but I’ve been cutting back since this breathing started. I didn’t want to push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you to listen to your body. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill, and it went away. Haven’t had any trouble with that since. I don't have diabetes, no. And my heart…the doctor always said it was strong. I had a regular check-up every year, until…well, until recently. I haven’t been feeling up to it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that's now controlled, and no known diabetes. And you haven't had a check-up recently. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days with pneumonia once, many years ago. But that was…oh, must be twenty years ago now. Nothing else, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a bout of pneumonia twenty years ago. Now, thinking about your family…are there any health problems that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had…arthritis, I believe. Badly, towards the end. And my father…he had a weak heart, I think. He didn't walk much towards the end, always tired. That’s about all I can remember, really. They both lived to be quite old, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis and some heart issues in your father. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, Doctor. It’s called…glucosamine, I think? For the arthritis. And sometimes I take a little something for sleep, a very mild one. Not every night, only when I'm really having trouble. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine and an occasional mild sleep aid. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything like that. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe Brussels sprouts. But that's just a personal dislike, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Fair enough! Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles for swelling. Then we can discuss what might be going on, and what we can do about it. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I just want to be able to sleep comfortably again. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back on the examination table, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some faint crackles at the bases. Moderate pitting edema present bilaterally in the lower extremities. Okay, Ms. Vanderwiele, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some fluid retention and early signs of heart failure. The difficulty breathing when lying flat, the ankle swelling, and the fatigue are all consistent with that. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this diagnosis.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is there anything we can do? I don’t want to end up in the hospital, Doctor. I live alone, you see. And this is all…very unsettling. What kind of testing do you mean?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Ms. Vanderwiele, but it’s often manageable, especially if we catch it early – and that's what we're doing. And I completely understand your concerns about living alone. We'll work together to create a plan that keeps you comfortable and safe. I'd like to order a few tests. First, an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart. Second, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. And finally, a blood test – a BNP level – which can help us determine if heart failure is present. We’ll also check your kidney function and electrolytes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…thorough. If that’s what’s needed to find out what’s going on, then yes. Can those tests be done here? And…how long will it take to get the results? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, all of those tests can be done right here in the clinic. The EKG and blood tests will be quick – about 30 minutes or so. The chest X-ray will take a little longer, perhaps another 15-20 minutes. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. So, well before your book club meeting on Thursday. We will contact you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I’d like to ask you to limit your salt intake and monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Less salt and watch my weight. I used to be a very good cook, but I suppose I can adjust. And…is there anything else I should be doing? Anything to make myself more comfortable while we wait for the results? I do get a little anxious when I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's good you're thinking ahead. While we wait, I'd recommend elevating your legs whenever you're sitting or lying down. This can help reduce the swelling in your ankles. And if you're feeling short of breath, try sitting upright or leaning forward. Also, ensure you're getting enough rest. I can also prescribe you a mild diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce the fluid retention. It may provide some relief while we wait for the test results, but it's not a long-term solution. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A water pill… If it might help me breathe easier, then yes. I suppose I’m willing to try anything, as long as it’s not…too drastic. What are the side effects? I don’t want to spend all my time running to the restroom!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The most common side effect is increased urination – which you correctly anticipated. You will need to urinate more frequently, especially in the beginning. It's also possible to experience some dizziness or lightheadedness, so it's important to get up slowly from a sitting or lying position. And, rarely, it can affect your potassium levels. We'll monitor that with your blood tests. I'm prescribing a low dose to start, and we can adjust it if needed. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Less salt, elevate my legs, a little water pill…and wait for the tests. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease…a little, at least. When should I come back for the results? And…who should I contact if I get really worried before then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's my pleasure. We'll call you as soon as the results are in, ideally within 48 hours. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. The number is 555-1234. You can ask for me, Dr. Pirl, or any of the nurses on staff. I've also given you a printed handout summarizing everything we've discussed today, including the instructions for the water pill and the symptoms to watch for. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I'll go home now and try to remember all of this. And…maybe take a little nap.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day. And try not to worry too much. We're here to help.
