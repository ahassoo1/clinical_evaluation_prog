DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… well, it’s this. It just… isn’t what it used to be. And it’s botherin’ me, terribly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not what it used to be” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more specifically what's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Botherin’ me? You askin’ a silly question! It’s… saggin’. Everything’s saggin’. Used to be firm, you know? Like steel. Now? Like… a bag. A bag of flour. And my wife, God rest her soul, always liked a man with a proper… shape. It’s just… not present anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. So it sounds like you’re concerned about some changes in the firmness and shape of your abdomen. And you're noticing this is impacting your self-confidence. Is that right?
PATIENT: Self-confidence? Now you talkin’ fancy. It just… looks bad. And I don’t like lookin’ bad. I used to be a strong man, you know? Pile drivin’ ain’t for weaklings. Now I look… soft. Is there somethin’ you can do about it or what? I ain’t here for a chat, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. We can definitely explore what options might be available. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other changes along with the firmness?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kinda changes? You gotta be more specific! I told you, it’s saggin’. You want me to describe the color of the saggin’? It’s skin colored! Look, I ain’t a doctor, I see a doctor. Don’t be askin’ me complicated questions. Is there a fix for this or not? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no, I don’t need a color description! Sorry, I'm just trying to get a better picture. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just…disappointment. A lot of disappointment. It’s uncomfortable, yeah. Like… somethin’s hangin’ loose. But not painful. Just… hangin’. It’s bothersome. Terribly bothersome. Now, can we get to the part where you tell me what can be done?
DOCTOR: Alright. So no pain, just a feeling of looseness and discomfort. Has this change happened gradually over time, or did you notice it suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually. Oh, definitely gradually. Not like I woke up one mornin’ and poof, everything’s gone south. It's been… slippin’ for a while now. Years, probably. I just… didn’t bother doin’ anything about it ‘til now. It’s gotten…noticeable. Especially when I look in the mirror. Not a pleasant sight, I tell ya. Now, are we gettin’ anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, so this has been a gradual change over years. And it’s become more noticeable recently. Before we discuss options, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? A few pounds, maybe. I ain’t been weighin’ myself religiously. Pile drivin’ makes a man hungry, you know? And when my wife passed… well, I lost my appetite for a while. But I’m eatin’ again now. Not as much as I used to, but I'm eatin’. Don't go makin' a big thing about a few pounds! Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Trendler. Weight changes can sometimes contribute to changes in abdominal shape. Now, have you noticed any hernias – any bulges that appear when you strain or cough?
PATIENT: Hernias? Bulges? Look, I’m a pile driver operator, not a medical textbook! I’ve felt a few things… movin’ around in there, maybe. But I just figured it was… gas. Old man gas. Is that a hernia? I don’t know nothin’ about hernias. Honestly, Doctor, you askin' me all sorts of questions I can't answer! Just tell me if you can fix this saggin' or not. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you may be describing a hernia, but it's hard to say for sure. To be certain, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your abdomen. That will help me determine if a hernia is present and assess the situation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You want to poke around in my stomach? Hmph. I suppose. But make it quick. And be gentle. I ain’t used to strangers touchin’ my belly. But if it gets this thing fixed, I’ll let you poke around a bit. But be quick, I tell ya. Quick!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could lie back on the exam table, please. I’m going to start by just looking at your abdomen, and then I’ll gently feel around. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. I do notice some mild skin laxity. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just relax your stomach muscles as much as possible. Hmm. I do feel a slight bulge in the lower abdomen, on the left side. It doesn't seem to be causing you any immediate discomfort when I press on it. Does that feel like anything you’ve noticed before?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. That's the one. Feels… soft. And kinda… empty. Like somethin’s pushin’ through. Not painful, like I said, just…there. It’s been gettin’ bigger, I think. Noticeable when I bend over. It’s… unnervin’. So? Is it bad? Can you fix it? Don’t tell me it’s somethin’ serious, Doctor. I ain’t got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. It appears you likely have an incisional hernia. This means there’s a bulge through a weakness in the abdominal wall, likely at the site of a previous surgery, although you didn’t mention a prior surgery. It's common after abdominal procedures. The “empty” feeling is likely the contents of your abdomen pressing against the weakened area. It's not an immediate emergency, but it's something that should be addressed. Left untreated, it can grow larger and potentially cause discomfort or complications. The good news is, it’s typically repairable with surgery. We have a few options: open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic is less invasive, with a faster recovery time, but open surgery might be necessary depending on the size and location of the hernia. I'd need to review your medical history more thoroughly, and possibly get an imaging scan, to determine the best course of action for you. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Surgery? You’re tellin’ me I gotta go under the knife? I ain’t a fan of surgery, Doctor. Never been a fan. What kinda recovery time we talkin’ about? I got things to do. And “less invasive” still means…invasive, right? Tell me more about this… lap-a-scope thing. But make it quick. And don't sugarcoat it. I want the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand your hesitation. Let's talk about the laparoscopic repair. It involves making several small incisions, rather than one large one like with open surgery. Through these incisions, we insert a camera and specialized instruments to repair the hernia with mesh. The recovery time is generally faster – usually about 4-6 weeks to return to most normal activities, with a gradual increase in exertion. There’s typically less pain and scarring compared to open surgery. You’d still need to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for a period of time, but it's less disruptive overall. Open surgery would involve a larger incision, a longer recovery time , and more pain. However, it may be necessary if the hernia is very large or complex. To determine the best option for you, I’d like to review your medical history, and I recommend a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture of the hernia's size and location. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, you're puttin' me through the wringer. Fine. Fine, do your tests. But if you find somethin' serious, I want to know upfront. No surprises. And what about the cost? I ain't made of money. Is my insurance gonna cover all this? I got a private plan, but these things… they can get expensive. Tell me about the money first. Then we talk about the scan.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand your concerns about the cost. Let me assure you, I’ll work with you and the insurance company to ensure you understand all the potential expenses. We have a billing department that can provide a detailed estimate of the costs, including the CT scan, surgeon’s fees, anesthesia, and any facility charges. Since you have private insurance, most of the costs should be covered, although you’ll likely have a deductible and copay. I can have them contact you directly to discuss your specific plan benefits and out-of-pocket expenses. I’ll also need to verify your medical history, including any prior surgeries or medical conditions. And to be thorough, I’d like to ask about any medications you’re currently taking. Do you have a list with you, or can you tell me about them?
PATIENT: Here. This is what the doctor gave me last time I saw a doctor. Years ago, mind you. Blood pressure pills, mostly. Amlodipine, is it? And… somethin’ for cholesterol. Atorvastatin, I think. That's all I take. Just those two. And I take 'em every mornin'. Now, can we please get this over with? I got appointments to keep. And I ain’t got all day to be sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Trendler. Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. That’s helpful to know. Alright, so to summarize: You’re taking Amlodipine and Atorvastatin for blood pressure and cholesterol. You've noticed a bulge in your lower abdomen that's been gradually increasing in size. And you have a history of… no prior surgeries that you recall. I recommend scheduling a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture of the hernia. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action – either laparoscopic or open repair. I'll have my nurse schedule the scan for you, and the billing department will contact you regarding the costs and your insurance coverage. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… get it fixed. That's all I want. And make it quick. I’ll be waitin’ for that nurse to call. And the billing people better not give me any trouble. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
