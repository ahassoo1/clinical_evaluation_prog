DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Donate, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… something about a check-up. For… work. They need me to be cleared for… performances, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. A physical, they said. I just want to get it over with quickly, if that’s alright. I don’t remember much about what they need specifically.
DOCTOR: "Performances," right. Well, we can certainly do a physical. Though, for work clearances, it's always best to have something specific to work with. Do you happen to have any paperwork from your employer detailing what they require?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Let me see… No, no, I don’t think so. They just said to come here. It was… the theater, I believe. A small one, downtown. They called me, said I needed this… clearance. I’ve been… ushering, mostly. And taking tickets. Though I did some… on stage work, a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I mostly just want to make sure I’m still able to… stand for long periods, I suppose. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Right. Ushering, ticket taking… some stage work previously. And the main concern is stamina, being able to stand for long periods. Okay. Well, we can definitely assess that. It's helpful to know what exactly they want checked, but we can start with a general physical and focus on your musculoskeletal system, your heart and lungs... just to get a baseline. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing… conditions? Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me think. I had… a bad back, years ago. A long time ago. But it doesn’t bother me much anymore. And… I think my eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be, but I have glasses. No… I don’t think that’s it. No serious illnesses, Doctor. I’ve been… pretty lucky, all things considered. Divorced, though. Does that count as a condition?
DOCTOR: Right, back pain in the past, glasses for your vision. And… we'll stick to the medical conditions for now. Divorced is… not a medical concern. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don't think so. Not that I’m aware of. I eat most things. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with certain pollens in the spring, but nothing serious. Nothing I take medicine for, anyway. Oh! Wait. I once had a rash from a… a cheap fabric. A polyester suit. But that was decades ago! Does that count? I really don’t think I have any real allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… No, no. Nothing regularly. Sometimes I take something for… sleep. Just when I can’t get to sleep, you know? A small pill. But it’s not every night. Just when I’m really restless. I don't even know what it's called, to be honest. My… ex-wife used to get it for me. I haven’t taken any in… well, I can’t remember when.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional sleep aid, unknown medication. Alright. Now, before we get to the physical exam, let's just quickly go over your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My… parents are both gone now. A long time ago. And I wasn’t very close to my siblings. I think… my mother had… high blood pressure, maybe? And my father… he smoked a lot. That’s about all I remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago. We didn’t talk about these things much. I’m really not very helpful, am I? I apologize. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn. You've given me what you remember, and that's perfectly fine. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at your reflexes and range of motion. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just… please be quick, if you wouldn’t mind? I have… things to do. Though I can’t quite remember what they are. But they’re important, I’m sure. Just… the quicker we get this over with, the better. Let’s just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax as much as possible. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 150 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Murmur present, grade II. We'll need to document that. Okay, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Breath sounds slightly diminished in the lower lobes bilaterally. Any shortness of breath or coughing you've noticed?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Not really… no. Sometimes, after I’ve been on my feet for a long time. But I just assumed it was… old age. Or the standing. I do a lot of standing, you know. Ushering. And the stairs… there are a lot of stairs at the theater. A little bit of a cough sometimes, too. Just a dry cough. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t think it was worth mentioning. I just thought it was… normal. For someone my age.
DOCTOR: Right. Murmur, diminished breath sounds, cough, and some shortness of breath with exertion. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you raise both arms over your head?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little difficult. It’s a bit stiff. It’s been like this for a while. Old injury, I think. Back injury, years ago. I told you about that. It doesn't really bother me much, but… it’s not as easy as it used to be. I’m not as young as I once was, Doctor. Everything creaks a bit.
DOCTOR: Right. Limited range of motion in both shoulders, with some discomfort. Alright, Mr. Krahn. I think I have enough information for now. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it appears you have some mild arthritis in your shoulders, potentially related to your previous back injury. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I detected a heart murmur and some diminished breath sounds. We need to investigate those further. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. And I’m also going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Would you be able to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh dear. More tests. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I’d really like to get this over with. I have… things to do. Though I still can’t remember what they are. How long will it take? And will it be expensive? I’m not… insured, you see. I just want to be able to… keep working. That’s all. That’s very important.
DOCTOR: The blood work and chest X-ray should take about an hour, maybe a little longer with waiting times. As for the cost… I understand you're uninsured. The X-ray will likely be around $200-$300, and the blood work… probably around $100-$150. I can have the billing department check for any available assistance programs, but I can’t guarantee anything. We need to rule out anything serious, Mr. Krahn. While it may just be age-related changes, we can’t know for sure without these tests. If you’d like, I can refer you to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist for a more specialized evaluation after we get the results back. They'll be able to give you a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… pulmonologist… Oh dear. It’s all so much. I… I don’t know. I just want to be able to… stand. And breathe. And… work. I suppose… if it’s necessary. But… the cost… Can we just… see what the tests say first? I don't want to get overwhelmed with more appointments and more bills before I even know what’s wrong. Just the tests, please. And maybe… maybe you could let me know the results as soon as you have them? I'm… anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the tests for now. I’ll expedite the results as much as possible and let you know as soon as they’re available. I’ll have the lab draw blood now, and then you can go to the radiology department for the chest X-ray. They're located in the building across the street. I'll give you a requisition form. Now, while you wait for the results, I recommend taking it easy and avoiding any strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Yes… I understand. Take it easy… avoid strenuous activity… emergency room. I’ll try. I really will. It’s just… everything is so much. Thank you, Doctor Donate. For everything. I… I just hope the tests don’t show anything too serious. .
DOCTOR: Right. You’re welcome. Get the tests done as soon as possible. We'll go from there. .
