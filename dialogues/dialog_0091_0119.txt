DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… delicate. Rather embarrassing, actually. I don’t usually discuss such things. But I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for, isn’t it? It’s… a problem with my… companion. A discharge. It's most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. These types of concerns can be difficult to discuss, and you’ve come to the right place. We'll address this with discretion and professionalism. To help me understand the situation better, could you clarify what you mean by “companion”?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Really. My… gentleman friend. My partner. My lover. Is that clear enough for you? Honestly, I thought it was obvious. It’s not as if I’m referring to a pet, you know. A most unsavory thought.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Wartick. I was attempting to be thorough, and perhaps overly cautious with terminology. Thank you for clarifying. So, to be certain I understand correctly, you are experiencing a discharge, and this is related to your intimate partner. Could you tell me more about the discharge itself?
PATIENT: Well, it's… slimy. And a rather sickly color. Not a pleasant white, if you must know. More of a… yellowish-grey. And there's an odor. A distinctly unfresh odor. It’s been going on for… oh, I suppose a week now? Maybe a little longer. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, rather concerning. He doesn't seem to notice it, which is… perplexing, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Wartick. A yellowish-grey discharge with an odor, present for approximately a week. And you mentioned your partner hasn’t noticed any changes?
PATIENT: Men. They rarely notice anything. Unless it’s about themselves, of course. He’s perfectly comfortable, I assure you. Completely oblivious. Which leaves me to deal with the… unpleasantness. And the worry, naturally. One reads things, you know. Horrible things. I certainly don't want to be… afflicted with anything dreadful. Is it contagious, Doctor? That's my primary concern.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Ms. Wartick. Contagiousness is certainly something we need to consider. To help me assess the situation, could you tell me a little more about your and your partner’s sexual history?
PATIENT: Sexual history? Doctor! Really! Is this necessary? I came to you with a medical problem, not to be subjected to a… personal interrogation. I find that question quite… inappropriate. I'm a respectable woman, you know. I shouldn’t have to discuss such things with a… a stranger!
DOCTOR: My deepest apologies, Ms. Wartick. You are absolutely right to express your discomfort. That was a poorly phrased question, and I should have been more sensitive. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. Let me rephrase. To understand potential causes for the discharge, could you tell me if either you or your partner have had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: Well… no. Not recently. We’ve been… exclusive for quite some time, thank you very much. And I assure you, I am not… promiscuous. It’s simply… baffling. Perhaps it’s something he’s eating? He does have a rather adventurous palate. But I doubt it. It's more likely something… untoward. Something I’ve contracted. A dreadful thought. Is it easily treated, Doctor? Please tell me it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Wartick. That’s helpful. It’s good to know there haven’t been any recent changes in partners. Given the information so far – a yellowish-grey discharge with an odor, present for about a week, and no recent changes in sexual partners – we need to consider a few possibilities. While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further investigation, this presentation could be indicative of an infection. However, there are other potential causes as well. To proceed, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you are comfortable with that. This will involve a visual inspection and potentially a swab to collect a sample for laboratory testing. This will allow us to accurately identify the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: An examination? Doctor, are you quite serious? I came to you with a complaint, not for a… a probing investigation! I hadn't anticipated this at all. I suppose… if it's absolutely necessary. But I must insist on a female nurse present. And no… unnecessary handling, if you please. I have standards, you know. Is there truly no other way? Perhaps a blood test? Or some sort of… scan? I do dislike the thought of being… examined. It's simply… unseemly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick, and I respect your boundaries. Your comfort is my utmost priority. A physical examination is often the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of a discharge, but we can certainly explore other options and proceed at your pace. A blood test is unlikely to be helpful in this specific case, as it typically doesn’t reveal the presence of infections causing these symptoms. A scan is also not indicated at this stage. However, to rule out any serious underlying issues, a simple swab to collect a sample for laboratory testing is highly recommended. This is a non-invasive procedure that can provide valuable information. And absolutely, I can arrange for a female nurse to be present throughout the examination, if that would make you more comfortable. We can also discuss the specifics of the examination beforehand to ensure you feel fully informed and at ease. Would you like me to proceed with arranging for a nurse and discussing the swab procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A nurse, yes. That is… acceptable. And a swab… if it must be. But please, be gentle. I am a delicate flower, you know. And explain everything thoroughly. I do not want any surprises. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified. But if it’s the only way… proceed, I suppose. Just be quick about it. And keep the examination as… discreet as possible. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I will ensure the procedure is as gentle, quick, and discreet as possible. I will explain each step thoroughly before we proceed. I will also have the nurse present to provide additional support and reassurance. Let me quickly excuse myself to arrange for the nurse and the necessary materials. I will return shortly to discuss the procedure in detail and answer any further questions you may have.
