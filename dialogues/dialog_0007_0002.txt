DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but please call me Valerie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Valerie, you said? My… my water. It’s hard to… go. Like it doesn't all come out, you know? It’s been… a little bit now. I forget exactly how long. It just feels… stuck sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re having some difficulty with urination – feeling like you’re not completely emptying your bladder. And you said this has been going on for a little while now. Do you mind if I ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what’s happening?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course dear. Ask away. I’ll try my best to remember… it's just… things aren’t as clear these days, you know? It's not a sharp pain, not like when I broke my arm when I was a girl. More like… a fullness. A bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, fullness and discomfort, not sharp pain. That’s helpful. And how often are you urinating during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I go… when I need to, of course! But… is it more than usual? I really don't know. My husband, he usually notices these things, but he's not here today. I think… maybe about the same? I drink a lot of water, always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, about the same frequency, even though you drink a lot of water. Do you ever feel like you have to go urgently, like you can’t wait?
PATIENT: Urgency… oh, sometimes. Not always. When I have to go, I go. It’s not like I’m running to the bathroom every five minutes, but… if I ignore it for too long, it gets a little uncomfortable. Then I really have to go. It's just… getting started is the hard part, I think. It doesn’t… flow right away, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so not constant urgency, but a little discomfort if you delay, and difficulty starting the stream. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh my. Color and smell… let me see. I haven't really paid attention, dear. It looks… yellow, I think. Like it should. I don’t recall anything different. My daughter always said I should drink more cranberry juice… for things, you know? But I don't always remember to get it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I haven't felt hot. And chills… not really. My bones do ache a little sometimes, but that's just getting old, I think. And my tummy… no pain, no. Just that fullness when I try to… you know. It’s not a bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain. Just fullness and difficulty starting urination. Now, have you had any medical conditions in the past, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I had a baby, of course! Two of them. And… I broke my arm when I was a girl, climbing a mango tree. And… let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? Thirty? I don't remember exactly. And… the doctor said my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, so I take a little pill for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had two babies, a broken arm, gallbladder removal, and you take medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. It’s… a little white pill. I take it every morning. My husband gets it for me, so I don't really pay attention to the name. It starts with an 'A', maybe? Or a 'B'? I’m sorry, dear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Zoie, don’t worry about it. We can look it up. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything! My husband always jokes I have an iron stomach. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. No hives, no swelling… nothing. I do get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just the dry air, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions before I do a quick exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my, no! Not me. Never have. My husband, he used to have a little beer now and then, but he stopped a long time ago. He said it wasn’t good for his heart. I just drink water, dear. Like I said, lots of water.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s very helpful, Zoie. Now, would you mind if I listened to your belly and did a quick exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones are a little creaky these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to listen to your tummy and feel for any tenderness. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any particular tenderness. I do notice a bit of fullness in your lower abdomen, which is what you were describing. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. This will involve a gentle tap to your knees and ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds good. Knees and ankles, you said? Just be careful, alright? I used to be a good dancer, you know. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And I'm noticing some decreased sensation in your lower extremities, but it’s mild. Okay, Zoie. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention – difficulty completely emptying your bladder – and some mild neuropathy, which is a decrease in nerve function. The diminished reflexes and sensation could be contributing to the retention. However, to get a more definitive answer, I'd like to order a post-void residual urine test. This involves a quick scan after you urinate to see how much urine is left in your bladder. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A scan… is that something… scary? I don't like needles, you know. And I don't want any… poking or prodding. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. What does "neuropathy" mean, exactly? Is that… serious?
DOCTOR: No, Zoie, it's not scary at all. There are no needles involved. It’s a quick, painless scan using a machine that uses sound waves, like an ultrasound. It doesn’t hurt at all. And “neuropathy” just means that the nerves in your legs and bladder aren’t working as well as they used to. It can happen with age, and it doesn’t always mean it’s serious. It can often be managed with simple exercises or medication. The post-void residual test will help us understand how much urine is left in your bladder after you go, and that will help us decide on the best course of action. If there is a significant amount of urine remaining, we may need to consider further testing or referral to a urologist – a doctor who specializes in bladder problems. Would you be comfortable with that test?
PATIENT: Oh, no needles, you say? And not scary? That's good. A little bit of a scan sounds alright, dear. As long as it doesn't hurt. And a urologist… is that someone who can fix things? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom like I used to. It's just… embarrassing, you know? Having to worry about this all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, a urologist is a doctor who specializes in bladder problems, and they can definitely help. They can diagnose the cause of your difficulty emptying your bladder and recommend treatments to get you back to normal. Okay, great. I'll have the nurse come in and perform the post-void residual scan after you urinate. She'll explain the procedure to you in more detail. In the meantime, I’m going to write up some instructions for timed voiding – that means trying to urinate at regular intervals, even if you don’t feel the urge – and pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These can help strengthen the muscles that control your bladder. And I’ll also write you a referral to a urologist, just in case we need further evaluation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… helpful, dear. Instructions and exercises… alright. And a referral, just in case. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… nice to have someone explain things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Zoie. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
