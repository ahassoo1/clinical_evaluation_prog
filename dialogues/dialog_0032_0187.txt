DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pipkorn, you say? Chest... hurts. And my heart... it feels like it's going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said it was high. Doctor told me come. Old doctor. Not you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. High blood pressure and chest discomfort are certainly things we need to address. Let's start with the chest pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe? It hurts! Like... a squeezing. Here. Not all the time. Comes and goes. When I walk too much. Or get… upset. You understand?
DOCTOR: I understand you experience a squeezing sensation in your chest, particularly with exertion or emotional distress. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Oh... a long time. Years, I think. Maybe five? Six? Hard to say. Old man forgets these things, you know. Not a big deal. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Not a big deal,” you say. However, chest pain for five or six years warrants investigation, regardless. To clarify, does anything relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Rest. Sitting still. Stop walking. Stop… thinking about things. Like I said, not a big deal. Why make trouble where there is none?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, with respect, dismissing symptoms is rarely a productive course of action. Now, let’s move on to your heart. You mentioned it feels like it’s racing. How frequently would you say this occurs?
PATIENT: Often. When I… get nervous. Or excited. Watching the news… bad news. Makes it beat faster. Everyday, maybe? I don’t pay attention. Old man. What does it matter how often?
DOCTOR: It matters because palpitations – the sensation of a racing heart – can be indicative of underlying cardiac issues. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Look… I don’t like doctors poking and prodding. Waste of time, if you ask me. I feel fine. Mostly. Just… old. And my heart beats. Everyone’s heart beats.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your reluctance. However, a physical examination is a necessary component of evaluating your complaints. It allows me to assess your overall health and determine if further investigation is warranted. It’s a brief procedure, and I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Tough Korean man, no allergies! Maybe… sensitive skin. Some bandages… itchy sometimes. That is all. Hurry up, if you must.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin then. Please lie back on the examination table. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is somewhat elevated, as you mentioned. I also detect a slight murmur. And your lungs sound clear, though there is some diminished breath sound at the bases. Blood pressure is 160 over 90. As expected, elevated. Now, I'd like to check your pulse in your extremities.
PATIENT: Murmur? What’s a murmur? Sounds bad. Just get it over with. Pulse… fine. Always been fine. Korean man strong pulse!
DOCTOR: The pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your lower extremities. Given your history of chest pain, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, and the murmur I detected, I believe further investigation is prudent. I would like to order an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart's electrical activity, and a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: X-rays? ECG? Blood tests? You want to poke and prod everything! Look, I’m an old man. I’m going to die eventually. Don't need fancy tests to tell me that. Just give me something for the blood pressure and let me go home. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, while I understand your desire to avoid unnecessary medical intervention, dismissing potentially serious symptoms is not in your best interest. High blood pressure, chest pain, and palpitations can be indicative of underlying cardiac issues that require investigation. I am not suggesting these tests to prolong your life indefinitely, but to ensure we are aware of your overall health status and can provide appropriate care. Refusing these tests could have consequences. I strongly recommend we proceed with the ECG, blood work, and chest X-ray. If you continue to refuse, I will document your decision in your medical record. However, I must advise you that this is not the course of action I recommend. Do you have any family history of heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… Everyone got something. Old family. Lots of… problems. My father… always complaining of his chest. My mother… fell down once. Maybe stroke. Don't remember. Lots of people get sick. That’s life. Just give me the pill.
DOCTOR: "Just give me the pill" is not a sufficient approach to healthcare, Mr. Sobkowicz. While I can prescribe medication to manage your blood pressure, it’s crucial to understand why your blood pressure is elevated and rule out any underlying causes of your symptoms. Starting medication without proper diagnosis could mask a serious problem and delay appropriate treatment. Given your family history of chest complaints and potential stroke, I remain concerned about a possible cardiac issue. I understand you are reluctant, but I strongly urge you to reconsider the recommended tests. I will explain the procedure for each test again if you wish. Alternatively, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a second opinion. However, I must document your refusal of recommended testing in your medical record. Do you understand the risks associated with refusing these tests?
PATIENT: Risks… Fine. Fine! Do the tests. All of them. Just… get it over with. Hurry up. I have things to do. But don't expect miracles. Old man, remember? Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood for the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. We will perform the ECG here in the examination room. And I will order the chest X-ray. It can be done at the imaging center across the street. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. In the meantime, I will write a prescription for a low dose of amlodipine to help manage your blood pressure while we await the results of the testing. However, I must emphasize that this is a temporary measure. We will adjust the dosage, or explore alternative medications, based on the test results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… No. Just… get it over with. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse to begin the bloodwork. She will be with you momentarily. I also want to discuss lifestyle modifications once we have the results of the tests. Diet and exercise can play a significant role in managing blood pressure and reducing your risk of cardiac events. We will review the results together once they are available.
PATIENT: .
