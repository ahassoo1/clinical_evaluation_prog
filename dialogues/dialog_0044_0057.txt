DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well… it’s about the cancer. I… I was told to come see you about it. I don't really know what happens next.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. It’s alright to be feeling unsure, that’s perfectly normal. I see here you’ve been recently diagnosed with cancer. That must be a lot to process. Can you tell me a little bit more about where you were diagnosed, and what the initial findings were?
PATIENT: Um… it was at the hospital, about a month ago, I think. They said… it’s in my breast. A lump. They did a… a needle test. And then another test with a picture… a mammogram? I think that's what they called it. They said it was… not good. But I didn’t really understand everything they said, honestly. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in the breast diagnosed about a month ago, with a needle test and a mammogram. And you felt a little overwhelmed with the information?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Very overwhelmed. And scared. They talked about… stages, and… treatment. But I don't really know what any of that means for me, specifically. And… my husband, he… he passed away last year, so I don't have anyone to really explain it to me right now.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That is a tremendous loss, and to be facing this on top of that… it's understandable that you’re feeling lost and scared. We will take things slowly, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Slowly would be… good. Thank you. What… what kind of treatment usually happens for this? Is it… painful? I worry about that. A lot.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea. Treatment options depend a lot on the type and stage of cancer – and your overall health. Generally, treatments for breast cancer can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these. As for pain… it really varies. Some treatments do have side effects that can cause discomfort, but we have excellent ways to manage pain and other side effects. We'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable. Before we talk specifics, could you tell me if the hospital provided you with any paperwork regarding the type of cancer you have?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Let me think. They gave me a lot of papers. I put them in a folder at home. I was so upset, I don't remember what all was in it. It has the results from the tests, I’m pretty sure. And… something about a specialist? I didn't really understand what that meant. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the specialist referral is definitely important. It means the hospital wants you to see a doctor who focuses specifically on breast cancer. They’re the best equipped to guide your treatment. Do you happen to remember the name of the specialist?
PATIENT: No, I’m sorry, I don’t. I just… remember a paper saying I needed to make an appointment. And a number to call. It was all very confusing, and I was… I was just trying to get through it. I probably should have written it down, but… I didn’t think straight.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. It’s completely understandable to be overwhelmed and not remember details when you're receiving difficult news. We can definitely look up the referral information for you using the hospital’s records. Before we do that, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A physical exam? What… what will you be doing? I’m a little nervous, if that’s okay to say. I haven't really… seen a doctor much since my husband passed. He always handled those things.
DOCTOR: It's absolutely okay to be nervous, Chellsea, and please feel free to tell me to stop at any time. The exam will be relatively simple. I'll mostly be checking your overall health – listening to your heart and lungs, feeling for any swollen lymph nodes, and, with your permission, examining the breast area where the lump was found. It will help me get a better understanding of your condition and ensure we have all the information before we discuss the next steps. We can also take things very slowly, if you prefer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… slowly sounds good. But… will it hurt? I’m really worried about pain. And… I don't think I can… I don’t have a very high tolerance for it. He always said I was a baby about needles and stuff. I feel silly even saying that.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to be honest about your concerns, Chellsea. There shouldn't be any pain with this part of the exam. We won't be doing any needles or blood draws today. It will mostly be palpation – feeling the area. If anything feels uncomfortable, please tell me immediately, and we’ll adjust what we’re doing. We'll go at your pace, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I can try. But… if it gets too much, I’ll tell you, alright? I promise. Where should I… should I lay down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. We’ll start by just getting you comfortable. And remember, you are in control, so please tell me if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Okay, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to breathe normally… it’s a little hard though. I get… short of breath sometimes. Especially when I think too much. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Chellsea. I am noting that you mention feeling short of breath sometimes. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear right now, but we’ll definitely keep that in mind as we proceed. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Now another one. Okay, everything sounds good so far. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to gently feel for any swollen lymph nodes in your neck and under your arms. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that sounds… alright. But please be gentle. I bruise very easily. He always said I was a delicate flower. It was… nice. But sometimes… it was annoying.
DOCTOR: I will be very careful, Chellsea. I am feeling your lymph nodes now. They feel normal on this side – no swelling or tenderness. And now on this side… Okay, everything feels normal so far. Now, if you're comfortable, I'm going to gently examine the area where the lump was found. Just let me know if anything feels tender or if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay… Ow… that’s… a little tender. Please be gentle. It feels… achy, all the time. Even when I’m not touching it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m very sorry. I will be much more gentle. It seems the area is quite sensitive, as you said. I'm just trying to determine the size and location of the lump. It feels approximately this size… and it’s located here. Is that accurate, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: Yes… that feels… about right. It’s… hard to tell, though. Sometimes it feels bigger, sometimes smaller. I think… it’s getting a little bigger, but I’m not sure. I try not to… touch it too much, because it makes me anxious. Is… is it bad that I haven’t told anyone about it yet? I just… I didn’t want to worry them. And I didn't know what to say. He… he always knew what to say.
DOCTOR: It is absolutely not bad that you haven’t told anyone yet, Chellsea. You are under no obligation to share anything you’re not ready to share. Facing this alone is incredibly brave, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to say. It's okay to take your time, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Right now, let's focus on getting you the information you need. I've noted the sensitivity of the area and the possibility of it growing. Now, do you remember if the hospital gave you any information about the type of cancer?
PATIENT: I… I think there was a paper with a lot of medical words. I don’t remember what any of it said. I think… it said “invasive ductal carcinoma” maybe? That sounds right… but I could be wrong. It was all… confusing. He… he always explained things so clearly. He was… a doctor too.
DOCTOR: “Invasive ductal carcinoma.” Yes, that is a specific type of breast cancer. And it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with medical terminology. It's a lot to process. I’m seeing here a report from the hospital confirming the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. It also mentions the results of the mammogram and the needle biopsy. The report recommends a consultation with an oncologist – a cancer specialist – for further evaluation and treatment planning. Do you have any questions about that, Chellsea?
PATIENT: An oncologist… What… what does that mean? Will they… will they do surgery? I’m scared of surgery. And… what if it’s… really bad? Will they… shave my head? I’ve heard… things. I don’t want to lose my hair. He always said I had nice hair.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be scared, Chellsea. It's completely normal to have those fears. An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer. They will review your case, discuss all of your options with you, and help you develop a personalized treatment plan. As for surgery… that's one potential option, but it's not always necessary. The oncologist will determine the best course of action based on the size and location of the tumor, its stage, and your overall health. And losing your hair is not always a side effect of treatment. It depends on the type of treatment you receive. If chemotherapy is recommended, there are ways to minimize hair loss, such as using a cooling cap during treatment. I want you to know that you are not alone in this, Chellsea. We will take things one step at a time. Right now, let’s focus on getting you a consultation with a trusted oncologist. I can help you with that. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would… that would be very helpful. I don’t know… I don’t know where to start. Is there… is there anything else I should know? Anything I should ask the oncologist? I’m scared I’ll forget something important. He always said I was terrible at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and forget things. I can provide you with a list of questions to ask the oncologist, including questions about the stage of your cancer, the different treatment options, the potential side effects of those treatments, and the long-term prognosis. We'll also discuss your family history, to see if genetic testing might be helpful. Here's a list of questions you can take with you to your appointment. I also recommend bringing a notebook to write down the answers. It can be helpful to have a friend or family member accompany you, to help take notes and provide support. And please, don't hesitate to ask the oncologist to explain anything you don't understand. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me for after you see the oncologist, so we can discuss their recommendations and create a personalized treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good. Thank you. Is there anything else I can do? Anything I should be doing right now? Besides… waiting. Waiting is… hard. He always said I was terrible at waiting.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid feeling, Chellsea. Waiting is hard. Right now, focus on taking care of yourself. That means getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and finding ways to manage your stress. Gentle exercise, spending time in nature, and connecting with loved ones can all be helpful. Don’t hesitate to lean on your support system, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help. If you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group. I can provide you with some resources for both of those options as well. Here’s a list of resources that may be helpful. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with the oncologist. Now, let’s get this appointment scheduled. Do you have a preferred day or time that works best for you?
PATIENT: Okay… thank you. I will… I will try to remember all of this. Monday mornings are usually good. Before noon, if possible. Is there anything… anything I should be afraid of? Besides everything.
DOCTOR: Monday mornings before noon it is. Let me see… there’s an opening next Monday at 10:00 am with Dr. Evelyn Reed. She is a wonderful oncologist, very compassionate and knowledgeable. As for being afraid… it's okay to be afraid. Fear is a natural emotion, and it’s okay to acknowledge it. But remember that you are not alone in this, and you have a team of healthcare professionals here to support you every step of the way. Try to focus on the positive – you’ve taken the first step in getting the care you need, and you have the strength to get through this. I know it’s easier said than done, but try to take things one day at a time. Okay, your appointment with Dr. Reed is scheduled for next Monday at 10:00 am. I’ve also emailed you a confirmation with all the details. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you… thank you so much for everything. You’ve been… very kind. I… I should probably go. Before I start… crying again. He… he always said I was a mess. But he loved me anyway.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, you've taken a brave first step, and I'm here to support you in any way I can. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And please, don't be hard on yourself. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to cry. You are strong, and you will get through this. Take care, Chellsea. And please, drive safely. .
