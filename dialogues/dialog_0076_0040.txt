DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, yes. Sixty-nine, Fijian…right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good day to you, Doctor Ruocco. Well, it’s this pain I get in my side, you see. Keeps coming back. And…and with it, these water infections. They tell me it’s something to do with my kidneys, but…it's been going on for a while now, and it’s rather bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Kidneys, alright. "Rather bothersome," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s not…sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, mostly on my left side. And then the burning when I…well, when I go to the toilet. It happens often enough that it's starting to worry me. I’m trying to drink plenty of water, like the nurses always say, but…it doesn’t always seem to help.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Left side, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the left side. Though sometimes it feels a bit…all over, if you know what I mean? Not always the exact same spot. And it seems to get worse if I’ve been…moving around a lot, or if I lift something heavy. But even when I’m resting, it's often just…there. It’s a constant worry, really.
DOCTOR: “Often”?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I’d say maybe…three or four times in the last year I’ve had to go to the clinic for the water infections. And the pain… the pain is almost every week, some weeks worse than others. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be, Doctor. Though I do try to remember to tell the nurses…it just feels like a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And these “water infections” – have they given you anything for them?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, they have. Usually some sort of…tablet, a white one. It usually clears it up after a few days, but then it just comes back again. The nurses at the clinic are very good, they always explain what it is, but I forget the names of things, you see. It’s the same with the pain too – they give me something for that sometimes, but it doesn't seem to fully stop it. It just…takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other problems?
PATIENT: Well… nothing major, Doctor. I get a little tired sometimes, more so than I used to. And my ankles… they do swell up a bit at the end of the day, especially if it’s hot. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. But…now that you ask, maybe it is something to do with the kidney trouble. I haven’t really thought about it much until now. I just wanted to get this pain sorted, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Any family history of kidney problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… my mother, she wasn't very well when she was older. She had trouble with her…well, with swelling, like me. And she was always tired. I don't know if it was her kidneys, though. We didn't have doctors around much where we lived then. And my father... he was a strong man, always healthy. Nothing like that on his side, as far as I know. It's all a bit hazy now, to be honest. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your abdomen, and I'll feel around a bit. Just lie back for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s a bit cold, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Not much tenderness…slightly guarded on the left, but nothing significant. Bowel sounds are present. I don’t hear anything alarming. Now, I'll take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That’s good to hear. I was a bit worried it was something serious. Go ahead, I’m ready. It’s always a bit tight, you know, this cuff. Feels like it’s cutting off my circulation sometimes! But I know it’s for my own good.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. We'll need to repeat it later. Now, I want to get some blood work done, a complete metabolic panel and a urinalysis, just to rule things out. And I’ll order a kidney ultrasound to get a better look.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. That sounds…thorough. Blood work and an ultrasound, is it? Will that take long? And…what exactly are we ruling out, if you don't mind me asking? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily, you see. I’m just an old man who wants his side pain to go away.
DOCTOR: We're checking for infection, kidney stones, and assessing your kidney function. It's routine. It will take a bit, the lab work, and the ultrasound will be scheduled for tomorrow. Now, if you feel any burning when you urinate, or fever, or notice any blood in your urine, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. Burning, fever, blood…I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining it all so clearly. Tomorrow for the ultrasound, is it? Will I need to do anything special to prepare for it? And…is there anything I can do in the meantime, besides drink plenty of water? Perhaps a certain type of food I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No special preparation for the ultrasound. As for diet…avoid excessive salt. It can worsen the swelling. Other than that, just continue with your normal routine. And try not to lift anything heavy. Now, are there any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: Oh, salt, alright. I do like a little salt on my fish, but I can try to cut back. No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Just… getting this pain sorted is my main concern. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so patiently. I always worry about bothering the doctors, you see. It's good to know what's happening, though. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will give you the lab requisition and schedule the ultrasound. I’ll review the results when they come in, and we’ll discuss them then. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time. I’ll see the nurse, then. Have a good day, Doctor Ruocco.
