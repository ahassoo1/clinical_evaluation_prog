DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, must be close to a week now, maybe a little longer. It's not the worst pain, but it's there, you know? Constant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Percell. A constant headache for about a week… that certainly sounds bothersome. Can you describe the pain a little more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It’s not like a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more… a dull ache. A pressure, really. Feels like a tight band around the back of my head, right at the base of my skull. Sometimes it goes up a little into the sides, but mostly just back there. And it doesn't really beat, if that makes sense. Just… is there. Mostly when I'm sittin' and readin', or workin' on the computer.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, a pressure at the base of your skull, sometimes radiating to the sides… and it seems to be worse when you’re reading or using the computer. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Hmm… layin' down seems to help a little. Not a whole lot, but definitely noticin' it's not as bad when I'm flat. And drinkin’ a glass of water sometimes takes the edge off. But nothin’ really makes it go away completely, if I'm bein' honest. I tried one of those over-the-counter headache pills… the kind with acetaminophen, I think… didn’t do much for it, either.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lying down offers some relief, and water helps a little. The acetaminophen didn’t seem to make a difference. Have you had headaches like this before, Percell?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… I think I had somethin’ similar a few years back. Maybe… five, six years ago? It wasn’t as bad, though. Went away on its own after a couple days. I didn’t bother a doctor then, figured it was just stress. This one’s lastin’ longer, that’s why I thought I should come in. I’m gettin' a little worried it's somethin' more serious, bein' my age and all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Percell. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Past headaches are important to know. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let's see… other symptoms… Not really. No fever, no dizziness. Vision’s been fine, as far as I can tell. I haven’t been nauseous or vomitin’. My neck’s a little stiff sometimes, but I figured that's just from sleepin’ in a funny position. Oh! And I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to… well, just gettin’ older, I guess. I haven't been eatin' as well lately, either. Not a big appetite. But nothin' major, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, dizziness, or vision changes. A little neck stiffness, fatigue, and decreased appetite… all noted. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh yes, Doctor. Let me think... I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe twenty years ago. Recovered from that just fine. And I was told I had slightly high cholesterol a few years back, but I haven’t been on any medicine for it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. My wife, bless her heart, she was the one who always went to the doctor for everything. I always figured I was too busy lookin' after things. I’m divorced now, so… well, you can imagine. I haven't had a regular check-up in… goodness, probably ten years.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pneumonia in the past, slightly high cholesterol, and haven't had a check-up in about ten years. That’s helpful information. Any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, fallin’ out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. Didn’t need any big surgeries or nothin'. Just a cast, and it healed up fine. It still gets cold sometimes, but that's it. Mostly just small things, you know? I’ve been pretty lucky, all in all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Not really any at the moment. Like I said, I haven't been on much. I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things goin', but that’s about it. And sometimes I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever for aches and pains, like ibuprofen, but not regularly. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife was the one with all the allergies, poor thing. Pollen, dust, certain foods… she always had to be careful what she ate. I’m pretty simple, myself. Can eat just about anything. Never had any trouble with that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be somethin' uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don't mind, please sit up there for me. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds are a little faint, but there are no murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs sound clear. I'm going to check your neurological function now. Can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Percell Gibbel, and today is… August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of these things. My daughter always says I’m gettin’ forgetful, but I think I’m still pretty sharp. Though I do sometimes misplace my glasses.
DOCTOR: That's good, Percell. You seem quite alert. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age, and your strength is a little reduced, but within normal limits for someone your age. I’m going to gently palpate your neck muscles now. There's some tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, which likely correlates with your headache. Finally, I'm going to briefly check your range of motion in your neck. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally normal, though your blood pressure is a little high, and your reflexes are diminished. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure could also be contributing. I do want to get a better picture of your overall health, though. Would you be open to getting some blood work done?
PATIENT: A tension headache… that sounds about right. I do spend a lot of time sittin’ at my desk, workin’ with numbers. And I worry a lot, to be honest. Blood work… yes, I suppose that would be a good idea. If it helps figure things out, then definitely. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what needs to be done. What kind of blood work are we talkin’ about? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll do a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to assess your thyroid function. We’ll also check your vitamin D level, as deficiencies can sometimes contribute to headaches and fatigue. You will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. I can give you a requisition form to take to the lab, and they can schedule an appointment for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen for your headache, as needed. Also, try to incorporate some stress-reducing techniques into your daily routine, such as deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That's… a lot of tests. But if it helps, then I’m willin’ to do ‘em. Fastin’ for 8-12 hours… I can manage that. I usually eat breakfast pretty early anyway. A requisition form… yes, please. That would be very helpful. And ibuprofen or naproxen… I’ve tried ibuprofen before, didn’t seem to do much. Maybe I’ll try naproxen. And stress-reducing techniques… Easier said than done, Doctor. But I’ll try. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate it. Just one question… how long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Percell. I understand it's a lot, but it's best to get a comprehensive picture of your health. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once they’re available, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll write you that requisition form now. Here you go. It includes all the tests we discussed. The lab should be able to draw all the samples in one visit. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's perfect. Three to five business days… I can wait. No, I think that covers everything for now. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me. I’ll schedule the blood work as soon as I can. And I'll try the naproxen. If the headache gets worse, or if I start feelin' any other symptoms, I'll give your office a call, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. If your headache worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, or numbness – please don’t hesitate to call my office immediately. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you, Percell. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and please try to get some rest.
