DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I was hoping you could take a look. It’s been happening for a little while now, though I can’t recall when exactly it started. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It’s common to not remember exact dates. Swelling… where are you noticing the swelling, specifically?
PATIENT: Mostly around here, Doctor. My neck. It… feels a bit full, I suppose. And sometimes it’s a little uncomfortable. Not painful, really, just… present. It’s hard to describe. I don’t quite remember what might have caused it, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, neck swelling. Has the swelling been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe… it's been fairly consistent, Doctor. Not dramatically worse, thankfully. Just… there. Like I said, my memory isn’t the best. Perhaps a little larger some days than others, but nothing alarming, I wouldn’t think. It's just been a constant awareness, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant awareness. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, any changes in your voice, or any shortness of breath along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath, no, not at all. My voice… It feels… normal, I think. Perhaps a little raspy sometimes, but I attributed that to simply being tired. Difficulty swallowing… there might be a very slight hesitation sometimes, but again, nothing significant enough to truly worry me, Doctor. I really don't believe so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those, thankfully. I haven’t felt unwell in that sense at all. No fever, no chills, certainly no night sweats... and my weight feels the same, as far as I can tell. It fluctuates a little, of course, but nothing drastic. I apologize for being so vague; it's frustrating not to have a clearer picture.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one, Doctor. I've seen doctors periodically, of course, for check-ups and such. But I don't… recall any specific diagnoses. Nothing major, I’m fairly certain. Perhaps a minor infection once or twice as a child, but nothing that required ongoing treatment. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. My past medical records aren’t readily accessible to me, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, Doctor. I haven't had any surgeries, to my knowledge. I would certainly remember something like that, I think. Nothing at all. I've been fortunate enough to avoid needing any procedures of that nature, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My family is… scattered, Doctor. We don’t have a lot of detailed medical conversations, unfortunately. I know my mother had… some heart issues when she was older, I believe, but I don’t have the specifics. And beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much information. It's not something we’ve traditionally discussed openly, I suppose. I apologize for my lack of detail. It’s frustrating not to be able to provide more.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t have any. I’ve never experienced a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I eat a fairly standard diet and haven’t had any problems with foods. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication I’ve taken, to my knowledge. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not currently taking any medications at all. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and haven’t needed anything prescribed recently. I take vitamins occasionally, a general multivitamin, but nothing regularly or specifically for a condition.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your neck then. If you could just sit up there for me. I'm going to palpate your neck, just feel for any lumps or abnormalities. Let me know if anything is particularly tender.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please proceed. I’ll let you know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay… just relaxing your neck for me. A little to the left… and now the right. Hmm… I do feel a slight fullness on the right side, about halfway down. Not particularly hard, but definitely there. Is this where you’ve been noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that feels about right. That’s… where I’ve been noticing it, yes. It's not painful, just… present. It doesn't feel different than usual at the moment, but it’s generally located in that area. Is it something concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's difficult to say definitively just by feeling it, but I'm also not overly concerned at this point. It could be a lymph node, which can swell for a variety of reasons—often something minor like a recent cold. Can you tell me if you've had any recent illnesses, even a mild sore throat or a head cold?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I believe I had a very mild sore throat a couple of weeks ago, perhaps two, but it resolved quickly on its own. It was just a slight scratchiness, really. Nothing that required any medication or even much attention. It barely registered, if I’m being honest. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: Possibly. A recent viral illness could explain the swelling. Now, I'm just going to check your thyroid as well. This may require me to touch your neck slightly more firmly. It feels normal, thankfully. Let me know if anything is uncomfortable.
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Proceed as you need to. That feels… a little strange, but not uncomfortable. No pain at all. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thyroid feels normal, as well. I'm not overly concerned at this point, but to be on the safe side, I would like to order a CBC – that’s a complete blood count – to rule out any infection and a TSH test to check your thyroid function. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A CBC and a TSH test… absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and ordering those tests. Would I be able to schedule those tests here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. Our phlebotomy department is just down the hall. I'll send the orders electronically, and they can draw the blood for you right away. It should only take a few minutes. The results will usually come back within a couple of business days. We can then discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: That’s excellent, Doctor. Yes, that works perfectly. A couple of business days sounds very reasonable. Thank you so much for your time and expertise. I will go down the hall now, and find the phlebotomy department.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. And feel free to let the staff know Dr. Cumper ordered the CBC and TSH. If you experience any significant changes—like increased pain, difficulty swallowing, or shortness of breath—before we get the results, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you in a couple of days.
PATIENT: I certainly will, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind reassurance. I’ll go ahead and head down to phlebotomy now. Have a good day.
