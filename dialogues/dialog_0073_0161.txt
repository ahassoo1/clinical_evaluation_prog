DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into something... about preventing HIV. I don’t know much about it, honestly. She said it’s a good idea to be prepared, you know? Especially these days.
DOCTOR: "Prepared," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. She calls it… PrEP? Said it’s a pill you take. Look, I'm 55, single, and... well, let's just say I'm dating again. It feels silly talking about this, but she made it sound like a smart thing to do, and I trust her judgment. Is that… what I’m here for? To ask about that pill?
DOCTOR: Right. PrEP. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. Yes, that's… a reasonable question to bring to a physician. It’s certainly become more common. Before we discuss that specifically, though, let's get a bit more information. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. It was a long time ago, before it was talked about so much. Probably not. I mean, I’ve had general check-ups, but I don’t recall specifically being tested for that. Would it be in my records, do you think?
DOCTOR: Let me take a look… Yes, here we are. Last full panel was in 2018, and it does not appear to include an HIV test. Alright. It’s good we’re establishing a baseline. Now, have you had any… recent changes in your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Recent changes… Well, yes, actually. Like I said, I'm… getting back out there. Started dating again about six months ago. It's… nice, but also a little scary, you know? New people, new everything. That’s why my friend mentioned this PrEP thing. It just felt like a responsible thing to consider. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dating again after a period of… inactivity. And wanting to be proactive about your health. Alright. Now, can you tell me a little bit about the nature of these relationships?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… just… dates. Dinner, movies, that sort of thing. And… some intimacy, yes. It’s not… a lot of people. Just a few. I haven’t met anyone… serious yet. And I always… we always use protection. But my friend said this PrEP is… extra protection. Is that right? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Protection is… good. Though relying solely on protection isn’t always sufficient, of course. And yes, PrEP is an additional layer of preventative measures. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. Like I said, I haven’t been… very active, you know? And when I have been, we’ve always been careful. I’ve always been pretty… cautious about that sort of thing. Is that a bad thing? I just want to be safe, that's all.
DOCTOR: Caution is never a bad thing, Ms. Trefren. It's… commendable, actually. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a general overview. I want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A full exam? I… I didn't realize it would be this involved. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I just wanted to ask about a pill… but if it’s what needs to be done, I suppose. Just… tell me what to expect, okay? I don’t do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Trefren. PrEP is a medication, and we need to ensure you're a suitable candidate before prescribing anything. It's not simply a matter of handing out pills. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that might contraindicate its use. It will be a relatively quick examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Standard procedure. Now, if you could just… please loosen your shirt.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. I just… I don't like doctors very much. Too much poking and prodding. And I always feel so… vulnerable. But you’re right, I guess. I need to do what’s best. Just… please be gentle? And tell me what you're doing as you go, okay? It helps to know what to expect. Is there anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 85… slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… a little sensitive. I had a cold last month, maybe that’s it? It’s still a little achy there, sometimes. And… yeah, I think my armpits are a little swollen too. Probably just from the deodorant, honestly. I use a new kind. It's supposed to be natural, but maybe it’s causing a reaction? Is that possible? I just hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: "Natural" deodorants can sometimes cause irritation, yes. However, swollen lymph nodes, even if mild, warrant further investigation. We'll need to draw some blood for a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And, given your recent cold and the swollen nodes, I’d also like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything… more serious.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray?! Oh, goodness. Is… is something wrong? I just wanted to talk about a pill! Now you’re talking about blood tests and X-rays… I’m starting to get really worried. What are you looking for? Is it something serious? I don’t like this at all. Maybe I should just… think about it. Perhaps this isn’t for me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, I understand your anxiety, but these are standard precautions. We are not looking for something wrong, we are ruling things out. It’s irresponsible to prescribe preventative medication without a baseline assessment. The blood tests will check your kidney and liver function, and the X-ray will ensure there's no underlying infection or other condition that could affect your ability to safely take PrEP. It’s a precaution, not a diagnosis. I assure you, we are taking all necessary steps to ensure your health and safety. Would you like me to explain the procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. You’re right. I suppose you’re right. It’s just… a lot. I’m not good with medical stuff. Explaining the procedures… yes, please. Tell me exactly what’s involved with the blood tests and the X-ray. And… what happens if something is wrong? Just… tell me everything. I need to know what I’m getting into. I really do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with the blood tests. A phlebotomist – a trained technician – will draw a small amount of blood from your arm, usually from the inside of your elbow. It will only take a few minutes. There might be a slight pinch, and you might feel a little bruising afterwards, but it’s usually minor. The blood will be sent to a lab, and the results should be back within a few days. As for the chest X-ray… you'll be asked to remove any jewelry or clothing with metal on it. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and a technician will take a quick image of your lungs and heart. It doesn't involve any radiation, it's just like a photograph. It doesn't hurt, you just need to remain very still for a few seconds. Now, what happens if something is wrong… that depends on what we find. If the blood tests show any abnormalities, we may need to do further investigation to determine the cause. If the X-ray shows any concerns, we may need to consult a specialist, such as a pulmonologist. We would discuss all of your options and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. But I want to emphasize, Ms. Trefren, that these are just precautions. It's highly likely that everything will be perfectly normal. We are simply being thorough. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. So, I have to go to a lab for the blood tests, and then… come back for the X-ray? When can I do all of this? I have a date on Friday… I don’t want to be sick or worried then. And… will I be able to still take this PrEP pill if everything is okay? I just want to be safe, you know? I really do.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is located just across the street, at the medical center. You can go anytime tomorrow. They don't require an appointment. As for the X-ray, we can schedule that for Thursday, so the results will be back before your date. And yes, if everything is normal – and again, that's the most likely scenario – then we can absolutely discuss starting PrEP. It's a very effective preventative measure when used correctly. Now, let me give you the paperwork for the lab tests. It has all the instructions and contact information. And I’ll have my nurse schedule the X-ray for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. That… that helps. No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… please let me know if anything is wrong, okay? Don’t sugarcoat it. I need to know. I guess I’ll go get the blood tests done tomorrow. Hopefully, everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Trefren. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the X-ray. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
