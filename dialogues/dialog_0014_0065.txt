DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… well, it’s my weight. I've gained a considerable amount recently, and I haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It's quite unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Considerable” is…vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: Forgive me. Yes, you are quite right. Approximately fifteen pounds over the last three months. It may not sound like much, but it feels…significant. And it’s just kept going up. I haven’t a clue why.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds… alright. And you're certain nothing’s changed?
PATIENT: Absolutely certain. I weigh myself every Monday, same time, same scale. Same clothes, or no clothes, always. And my husband confirms, he’s noticed it too, of course. We eat the same things, mostly. Potatoes, chicken, vegetables… traditional Lithuanian fare, you see. Nothing extravagant. I haven’t started any new habits, or stopped any old ones, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. “Traditional fare”… I see. And how active are you typically, Reneisha?
PATIENT: Well, my occupation keeps me on my feet quite a bit, Doctor. I work as an orderly at the hospital. It's a demanding job, lots of lifting and walking. Outside of that… not as much as I’d like, admittedly. My husband and I enjoy a bit of gardening when the weather permits, and we walk to the market most days. But strenuous exercise… no, not regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, hospital work, gardening, walking… all that should be burning some calories. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really… no. Perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the job. And maybe… maybe I feel a little colder more often? Though that could simply be the summer air conditioning. I truly don't know. I am not generally one for noticing such things, to be perfectly honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A little colder… alright. And have you had any issues with… regularity?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that is a rather personal question, isn’t it? If you must know, yes. I’ve been… less regular. It's a bit embarrassing to discuss, but there it is. Not a major issue, but noticeable. Perhaps coinciding with the weight gain, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Reneisha?
PATIENT: Actually… yes. I hadn't thought to mention it. My feet do feel a bit puffy at the end of the day, more so than they used to. And sometimes my ankles look a bit… swollen. I chalked it up to being on my feet all day at the hospital, but now that you ask… perhaps it’s connected? I really don't understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, thyroid issues, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Perfectly healthy, always have been. At least, that's what my doctor in Vilnius always said. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, never needed any major surgery. My husband jokes I’m built like a tank. Though perhaps not currently, given the circumstances.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, high blood pressure I believe. And my grandmother, on my father's side, had diabetes, but it developed when she was quite old, so it was never a major concern. Otherwise, no significant medical history that I’m aware of. Mostly just… long lives, generally. My family is Lithuanian, you see, we tend to be… sturdy. But I confess, I’m quite worried about this unexplained weight gain. It feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve always been able to eat and take anything without issue. No rashes, no swelling, nothing. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s the extent of my medication. And again, I haven't taken anything new. I assure you, nothing has changed. This is what makes it so perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, Reneisha. Just to get a better baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure. Then, I think we’ll need some blood work. Just to rule things out. Let’s start with your blood pressure, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Anything to get to the bottom of this. Please, proceed. I am… a bit anxious, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. Blood pressure first, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me. Alright… 142 over 90. A little elevated. Heart rate is 88, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear. Now let’s check your thyroid. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. No nodules that I can feel. Now I'm going to listen to your heart again. No murmurs, but there is a slight irregularity. Nothing alarming, but we’ll want to investigate further with an EKG. Now, let’s get those blood tests ordered. I want a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a CBC. That will give us a good starting point.
PATIENT: An EKG… and more blood tests. It sounds… rather serious. The irregularity… is that connected to the weight gain, do you think? I am terribly afraid there is something seriously wrong with me. I only wanted to understand why my clothes no longer fit, and now… this.
DOCTOR: Now, Reneisha, let's not jump to conclusions. An enlarged thyroid and a slight irregularity don't automatically mean anything serious. They simply indicate we need more information. These are things we are investigating, not diagnoses. The weight gain could be related, or it might be a separate issue. We need to see the results of the blood work and EKG before we can make any definitive statements. Now, do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Not about the tests themselves. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… what happens next? I must be honest, Doctor, I am rather easily frightened. The waiting… that is the most difficult part.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about three to five business days. The EKG can be read much faster, usually within the hour. We’ll call you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, I recommend you try to relax and not worry too much. Easier said than done, I know. We’ll discuss the results and what the next steps are when we have them. Now, given your weight gain and slightly elevated blood pressure, I suggest a low-sodium diet and some gentle exercise, if you are able. And I'm going to write you a referral to an endocrinologist, just to get a second opinion on the thyroid. It's always best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An endocrinologist… good. Thorough is good. Low sodium, gentle exercise… I can manage that. Though I confess, I am terribly worried about what the results will show. But thank you, Doctor. You are very… reassuring. I suppose all I can do now is wait. .
