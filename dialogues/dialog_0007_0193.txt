DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to see you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Hernandez. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, it is a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have… a lot of gas. Much more than usual, you understand? It is… quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed at all, it happens! It's good you're bringing it up. “A lot of gas” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you for saying so. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? It is… constant, really. Not always painful, but… frequent. And sometimes, quite loud. I eat normal things, you know? Not anything too… unusual. Mostly sandwiches, soups, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, constant, and not related to anything drastically different in your diet… that’s helpful. When you say “soups,” what kind of soups are we talking about?
PATIENT: Mostly… chicken noodle soup, tomato soup. Things you buy in the store, in a can. Sometimes I make my own, with vegetables… carrots, potatoes, onions. But not… spicy things, you understand? Nothing with beans, or… cabbage. I avoid those. They cause… trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally avoiding foods known to cause gas. Good. And when you say “trouble,” what happens when you do have those foods?
PATIENT: Well, it is… unpleasant. Much more gas, of course. And… a little bit of stomach pain. Not terrible pain, but uncomfortable. And… it smells, Doctor. A very strong smell. I do not want to be rude, but it is important you understand the full situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you being so thorough, Jammal. Strong smell along with the pain and increased gas when you have things like beans – that gives us a little more to work with. Have you noticed any change in your bowel movements – more frequent, less frequent, looser, harder?
PATIENT: Yes, that is a good question. I… believe they are more frequent. Perhaps one or two more times a day than usual. And… not as solid, you understand? A little bit… softer. Not… diarrhea, exactly. But not… firm. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent and less firm stools. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No blood, and not… tarry, as you say. Everything looks… normal color, when it comes out. Just… more of it, and softer. I was worried you would ask that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Good, that's reassuring. And have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I… weigh myself sometimes, but it is always about the same. Maybe a little up, maybe a little down, but nothing… dramatic. I am a small man, you understand. 129 pounds, usually. I eat enough, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss. And just to be thorough, any nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or abdominal pain besides what you experience with the gas?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. No nausea, no vomiting. A little bit of heartburn sometimes, but I take something for that, a little pill. And the abdominal pain… it is only when the gas is bad. It is not constant, you understand? It comes and goes with the… the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have… high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day. And… I had a small operation on my knee many years ago, but it healed well. Other than that, not much. I am usually a healthy man, you understand? I try to be. I have Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: It is important, thank you. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a past knee surgery. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any pill… usually. Never had a problem with that. My mother always said I had a strong stomach, before all this gas, you understand? It is ironic, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. And sometimes, when the heartburn is bad, I take a little antacid tablet. It is called… Tums, I think. Over the counter, you understand? I buy it at the store. Other than that, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about family history. Do you have any family members with digestive problems like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: That is a good question… My mother… she had some stomach problems when she was older. Not sure what it was, exactly. She just… didn't eat much. And… my uncle, on my father's side, he had colon cancer, many years ago. But he was a smoker, you understand? I do not smoke. That is all I can remember, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with unspecified stomach problems and an uncle with colon cancer . Finally, a few questions about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I do not drink alcohol. I never have. And I do not smoke, as I mentioned. And certainly not… recreational drugs. I am a quiet man, you understand? I mostly stay at home, read books, watch television. I do not go out much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jammal. That gives me a good picture. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. It's a little bit tender in the lower abdomen, but no significant masses or rigidity. I hear some… increased bowel sounds, which isn't surprising with the gas. I don't feel anything concerning. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of excessive gas, possibly related to a mild functional gastrointestinal disorder. It's important to rule out other causes, though. I'd like to order a stool test to check for any infections or inflammation. Also, I’m going to recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet, which can help identify trigger foods. Have you heard of that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not heard of that before. A… low-FODMAP diet? What does that involve? Will it be difficult? I do not want to have to… stop eating everything I enjoy. It sounds complicated.
DOCTOR: It can seem complicated at first, but it’s temporary. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols – basically, certain types of carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the gut and cause gas and bloating. The diet involves temporarily restricting high-FODMAP foods, like onions, garlic, apples, pears, wheat, dairy, and beans, for a couple of weeks. Then, we slowly reintroduce them one by one to see which ones trigger your symptoms. I have a handout here with a detailed list of foods to avoid and foods you can eat. A registered dietitian can also be very helpful in guiding you through this process. Would you like me to schedule a consultation with a dietitian?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very helpful, thank you. A dietitian sounds like a good idea. I am not very good at… diets, you understand? I need someone to help me with the list, and make sure I am still eating enough. And the stool test… is it unpleasant?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll get that scheduled for you. As for the stool test, it’s not too bad. You’ll receive a collection kit, and you just need to collect a small sample at home, following the instructions. It's best to collect it after a bowel movement. It’s a bit… inconvenient, but necessary to rule out other causes. The lab will send the results to me, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. A little bit inconvenient, perhaps, but I understand it is important. And the follow-up appointment… how long will that be? And will you explain the results of the tests in detail? I do not want to be left wondering.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, so we have time to get the stool test results back. I will explain everything in detail, and we can discuss the results of the diet trial as well. I’ll also give you some general recommendations for managing gas, like avoiding carbonated beverages, eating smaller meals, and chewing your food thoroughly. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been very helpful, and I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jammal. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
