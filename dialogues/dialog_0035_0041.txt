DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain. Things just aren’t as strong as they used to be. My legs, mostly. They feel… tired, even when I haven’t done much. It’s been getting worse slowly, over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. “Tired legs” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not like a pain, exactly. More like… heavy? Like trying to lift something very, very big all the time. And sometimes, my feet… they don’t always do what I tell them to do, you know? Like they stumble a bit, even on a flat floor. It worries my wife, she’s been very helpful getting me here today.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heavy feeling and some stumbling… That’s helpful. Has this been happening more recently, or has it been pretty consistent for a while now?
PATIENT: It's been… gradual, Doctor. I think it started maybe six months ago, just a little bit harder to get up from chairs. Now, walking even short distances… it takes more effort. It’s definitely worse lately, yes. I didn’t want to bother you unless it was really getting bad, you understand? I don't like complaining.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Dorman. It’s good you came in now. Let’s talk a bit more about this. Do you notice it’s worse at a certain time of day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so, really. It's pretty much there all the time, but like I said, it does get worse if I try to do too much. Standing for a long time is hard. And… sometimes it feels a little… numb? Not always, but sometimes my feet feel cold and tingly, even when they're warm. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant heaviness, worse with activity, and occasional numbness or tingling. Have you noticed any pain anywhere else – your back, hips, knees?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just the legs, mostly. My hands get a little shaky sometimes, but that doesn't bother me too much. I used to be very strong, you see. I was an athletic trainer for many years, worked with the high school football team. But that was a long time ago. I worry this is… old age catching up to me, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dorman. It sounds like we need to do a thorough exam. Before we do that, let's get a little more background. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older! My wife keeps a close eye on me, though. She's always making sure I eat right and get enough rest. I have Medicare, if that helps. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Dorman, and it’s wonderful you have such good support. Medicare is helpful for billing. Okay, and have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, no. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football, but that healed up fine. I was in the hospital once for the flu, a long time ago. But nothing serious. Mostly just small things over the years, nothing that would be important now, I don't think. Is this getting us somewhere, Doctor? I hope we can find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… that’s a good question. My mother, she had some trouble walking when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. She passed away many years ago. My father was very strong and healthy his whole life. I have a brother, he lives on the mainland, and he’s doing okay as far as I know. No one else in the family that I remember had trouble with their legs like this. I’m not sure if that helps, Doctor? It feels like a long time ago, trying to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history not particularly relevant. And do you take any medications currently, Dorman?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly, Doctor. Just sometimes a little something for a headache, but that’s it. Mostly just try to rest when I need to. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, you see. My wife keeps telling me to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor said it was fine at the last check-up. It's all a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay, Dorman, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, and let's see how you walk?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. Just be careful, please. It’s a little unsteady sometimes. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. I'm noticing a bit of a shuffle when you walk, and your balance seems a little off. Let's check your reflexes and strength now. Could you sit back down for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. It feels strange having you watch me like this, Doctor. But I understand you need to see what’s going on. I just want to know what’s wrong, if anything. Is it something serious? My wife will be very worried if it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dorman. We are just gathering information right now. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your strength is slightly weaker in your legs, particularly in your ankles and feet. I'm also noting some decreased sensation to light touch in your feet.
PATIENT: Decreased sensation… that explains the numbness, then. So, it is something serious? What is it, Doctor? Is it something I got from working with the football team, maybe? All those bumps and bruises over the years… I hope it's not my back. My wife needs me, you see. I help her with the garden, and… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy—nerve damage in your legs and feet. It can cause weakness, numbness, tingling, and difficulty with balance. While it could be related to past injuries, it’s more common with age, and conditions like diabetes – though you said you don't have that. We need to do some blood tests to rule out other causes, like vitamin deficiencies, and an EMG/NCS to assess the nerve function in your legs. I'm also going to order a Vitamin B12 level and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would you be willing to schedule an appointment with neurology for further evaluation?
PATIENT: Neurology…? Is that… a specialist? What will they do? And an EMG/NCS… that sounds complicated. What does that even mean? And all these blood tests… will they hurt? My wife… she’ll be very worried about all this. What is the cause, Doctor? Is it something I can fix? I just want to be able to walk normally again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman, let's take things one step at a time. Neurology is a specialist that focuses on the nervous system – brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They can help determine the exact cause of the neuropathy and recommend the best course of treatment. An EMG/NCS—electromyography and nerve conduction study—is a painless test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles. It doesn’t hurt, but it can be a little uncomfortable. It will help us understand where the nerve damage is and how severe it is. The blood tests are just to rule out other possible causes. It’s important to get all the information before we start any treatment. As for the cause, it could be a number of things, including age-related changes, genetics, or, less commonly, other medical conditions. We’ll get a clearer picture after the tests. I understand your wife will be worried, and that’s perfectly normal. We’ll discuss the results with her, too, and explain everything in detail. We’ll work together to figure out the best plan for you, whether that means medication, physical therapy, or other treatments. I’m going to order these tests, and I’ll have the nurse schedule a neurology appointment for you. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that make your symptoms worse. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… all right. So, tests and then see a specialist… I guess that’s what I need to do. Will Medicare cover all of this? And… how long will it take to get the results? My wife is very good at keeping track of things. She’ll want to know everything. I just hope it’s not too serious. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover these tests and the neurology appointment. There may be a co-pay, so the nurse will go over the billing details with you. The results usually take about a week to come back, but it can sometimes be longer. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. I will also send the results to the neurologist, so they have them when you see them. I understand your concerns, Dorman. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. We'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. For now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your neurology appointment. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle with the blood draw. My veins aren’t always easy to find.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. I’ll make sure to tell the nurse. We'll get this sorted out. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. .
