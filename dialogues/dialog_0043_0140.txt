DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's... rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see? It's quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. Honestly, I doubt it’s that serious.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these sorts of things, Mr. Schieber. There’s no need to feel embarrassed at all – that's what I'm here for. A white coating in the mouth can have several causes, some more significant than others, so it's good you came in to get it checked. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, it just is white. On my tongue, mostly. And inside my cheeks, a bit. It doesn't... hurt, exactly. More like... unpleasant. I've been rinsing with mouthwash, but it doesn't seem to do much good. It's probably just something I ate. I assure you, Doctor, I have a very busy schedule. I don't have time for… complications.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Schieber, and I understand your concerns about your busy schedule. Even if it is something minor, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. You mentioned it’s mostly on your tongue and inside your cheeks. Has it been getting worse, staying the same, or improving at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t been paying attention to whether it’s getting worse. I noticed it a few days ago, and it’s still there. It’s… persistently there. I really don’t see what a detailed timeline will accomplish, Doctor. It’s white. It’s in my mouth. Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. You're right, "white coating in the mouth" is a good starting point. A more detailed history simply helps me narrow down the possibilities and ensure I don’t overlook anything. Let’s try this: besides the white coating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I haven't been feeling sick, if that's what you mean. Perhaps a little tired, but that's from work. And my wife makes me eat… healthy things. Is that relevant? I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at, Doctor. This feels… unnecessarily thorough.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I apologize if it feels overly thorough, Mr. Schieber. It’s simply my practice to be comprehensive. I just want to be sure we’re covering all bases. When you say "healthy things," does your diet include a lot of sugary foods or drinks?
PATIENT: Sugary foods? Doctor, I am a grown man. I eat what I want. My wife tries to get me to eat fruit, sometimes. And yogurt. It’s… unpleasant. Look, is this going to take long? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting. I really don’t have time for a lengthy… oral examination.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about your schedule, Mr. Schieber. I assure you, I’ll be as efficient as possible. To get a better understanding of what might be causing the white coating, I would like to take a quick look inside your mouth. It won’t take long, and it will help me determine if any further investigation is needed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I expect a swift diagnosis and a quick solution. I haven't got all day to sit here while you… inspect my mouth. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Just… be quick, Doctor. Very quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I will be as efficient as possible. Please open your mouth for me when you're ready. Alright. I see a white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. It doesn't appear to be causing any significant irritation at this time. It looks somewhat patchy, and I don’t see any open sores or bleeding. It's possible this is a case of oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. However, given your history of a busy schedule and potentially not getting a thorough and balanced diet, it could also be a simple case of poor oral hygiene, and sometimes dietary factors can contribute.
PATIENT: Thrush? Candidiasis? Are you telling me I have some kind of… infection? I assure you, Doctor, my hygiene is perfectly adequate. And I eat when I have time. This is ridiculous. What does this… thrush even mean? And what do I need to do about it? I expect a straightforward answer, and not a lot of medical jargon.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily an infection, Mr. Schieber. Candidiasis is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of a fungus naturally present in the mouth. It's not typically serious, especially if caught early. It can be associated with a weakened immune system, but it’s also frequently seen in individuals who are stressed, have poor oral hygiene, or take certain medications. In your case, it's likely related to a combination of factors - possibly stress from your busy schedule and a less-than-ideal diet. To address it, I recommend improving your oral hygiene by brushing and flossing twice daily. I'd also suggest reducing sugary foods and drinks. Over-the-counter antifungal mouthwash, such as nystatin, can often help clear it up within a week or two. Would you like me to write you a prescription for that, or would you prefer to try the over-the-counter option first?
PATIENT: A prescription? No, absolutely not. I am not taking any unnecessary medications. Over-the-counter… fine. Whatever. Just tell me what to buy, where to buy it, and how much. I haven’t got time for a detailed shopping list. And I expect this to work. I have a very important presentation next week. Do you understand? I can’t afford to be distracted by a… fungal overgrowth. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. You can find nystatin mouthwash at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even many grocery stores with a pharmacy section. Look for the oral suspension. The instructions on the bottle will vary slightly depending on the brand, but generally, you’ll swish about 5 milliliters in your mouth for 30 seconds after meals and then spit it out. Do this four times a day for about a week, even after the coating starts to disappear, to prevent it from returning. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if you develop any new symptoms like pain or difficulty swallowing, please come back and see me. I'll also give you a handout summarizing these instructions and some tips for maintaining good oral hygiene. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
