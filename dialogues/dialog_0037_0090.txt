DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I… I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery? It’s… it’s about wanting to get something done, cosmetically. My husband… he would have wanted this for me, and now… well, now I'm finally trying to move forward. I’m afraid my memory isn't the best these days, so I don’t recall all the specifics about the appointment process.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. Many people find it difficult to remember everything, especially when dealing with personal matters. It sounds like you’re preparing for an elective surgical procedure. That's good. We'll definitely go over everything again today to make sure you're comfortable and informed. Before we dive into the specifics of the surgery, could you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to achieve with it?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be lovely. It's… it's my face, Doctor. I… I used to really love how I looked, but after… everything, I just don’t recognize myself anymore. It’s hard to explain. I think… I think I’d like to regain some of that confidence again, if that makes sense? It’s not about vanity, truly. Just… wanting to feel like me again. I'm not sure what procedure would be best, to be honest. I was just told a clearance was needed.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Brightful. It’s completely understandable to want to feel like yourself again, especially after a difficult time. And it’s not about vanity at all – it’s about your well-being and self-esteem. So, a surgical clearance. Let’s start by getting a little more background information. I have your basic demographics here, but could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Let me see… I believe I had… mild asthma as a child, but it hasn’t bothered me in years. And… I broke my arm once, when I was younger, but it healed perfectly. Nothing major, I don’t think. Oh! And I had my tonsils removed when I was a teenager. I’m terribly sorry if I’m being vague, Doctor. It’s just… everything feels a bit distant. Is there anything specific you're looking for? Perhaps a list would help me remember.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being vague at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. Knowing about the childhood asthma is helpful. Has it required any treatment recently—in the last year or so—or even caused you any trouble?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. It hasn't bothered me since I was a little girl. I haven’t needed any inhalers or anything like that. I can run around and… well, I do a lot of gardening, and that doesn’t usually present any problems. I like being outside. It's… therapeutic.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. Gardening is wonderful. Now, let’s move on to surgeries. Aside from the tonsillectomy you mentioned, have you had any other surgical procedures in your life?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t think so. No… no other surgeries, as far as I can recall. Perhaps a few fillings at the dentist, but nothing… major. I distinctly remember the tonsils, and… that’s it. My husband always handled the medical paperwork, so I wasn’t always privy to the details. He was very organized.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for one partner to take the lead on medical matters. No worries at all. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandmother… on my father’s side… she had something with her heart, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. My husband’s family was quite healthy, actually. Very robust. I’m afraid I’m not very knowledgeable about our family medical history, Doctor. It was never really discussed. Would it be helpful to speak with any relatives? Perhaps they could provide more information?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. Family medical history can be difficult to trace. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure is helpful, and it’s good to know your husband’s family was generally healthy. It’s not essential to have a complete history, but if you ever think of relatives who might have relevant information, that could be helpful. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. My husband… he didn’t approve of those things, and I… I adopted his lifestyle. We were very happy together.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Brightful. And it sounds like you had a wonderful partnership. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any significant allergic reactions in the past. I’m slightly sensitive to pollen, during the spring, but that’s just a bit of a runny nose and sneezing – nothing serious. I’ve never had a severe allergy to any medication or food. I once had a bit of a rash after using a new hand cream, but I stopped using it immediately, and it cleared up. Is that something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: No, a mild rash from a new hand cream doesn’t seem concerning. That sounds like a contact dermatitis, which is fairly common. Okay, Ms. Brightful, that gives me a good overview of your medical background. Now, let’s talk a little bit more about the procedure you're considering. You mentioned wanting to regain some confidence and feel like yourself again. Can you tell me specifically what areas of your face you’re hoping to address?
PATIENT: Oh… well, this is a bit difficult to talk about. It’s… mostly my cheeks, I think. They seem to have… lost their shape. And the lines around my mouth… they’re quite prominent. I suppose… I’d like them to be less noticeable. It’s just… I feel like I’ve lost my youthful appearance. It sounds vain, I know. But I miss feeling… attractive.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound vain at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s completely understandable to want to feel good about your appearance, and it’s perfectly acceptable to seek ways to restore your confidence. Many people feel the same way. So, you’re concerned about loss of volume in your cheeks and lines around your mouth. That sounds like we could discuss options such as dermal fillers and potentially a lip lift, depending on the severity of the lines. But before we get into specifics, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check of your overall health and a closer look at your facial structure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam would be good. I just… hope I’m not too out of shape. I haven’t been very active since… well, since everything happened. But yes, please. Let’s proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat on the exam table, that would be great. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll take a closer look at your face. Nothing to worry about at all. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I hope it’s not too high. I do get a little anxious at the doctor's office, which probably doesn’t help. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Just relax your arm, Ms. Brightful. Deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Everything looks good so far. Now, let’s take a closer look at your face. Can you look straight ahead for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m just a bit… self-conscious, I suppose. But I want to be honest with you about how I feel.
DOCTOR: I see. You have some natural volume loss in your cheeks, which is common with age. Your nasolabial folds are becoming more pronounced, and there are some noticeable lines around your mouth. Your skin has good elasticity, which is a positive sign. There's no asymmetry or any other concerns that I see immediately. Overall, your skin is in good health. These are all changes that can be addressed with various cosmetic procedures. I'm thinking dermal fillers would be a good starting point for restoring volume in your cheeks and smoothing out the nasolabial folds. We could also discuss a lip lift to address the lines around your mouth, but that's something we'd need to consider carefully. Do you have any questions so far, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Dermal fillers… a lip lift… It all sounds… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. What exactly are dermal fillers? And what does a lip lift involve? Is it… painful? And how long would the results last? I’m terribly sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor, but I want to be fully informed before making any decisions. I just… I don’t want to make a mistake.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. You’re absolutely right to ask questions – it’s important to be fully informed. There’s no such thing as a silly question when it comes to medical procedures. Let’s start with dermal fillers. They're essentially injections of a gel-like substance, typically hyaluronic acid, which is naturally found in your body. We inject them under the skin to add volume, smooth out wrinkles, and restore a more youthful appearance. It’s a relatively quick and non-surgical procedure. As for a lip lift, it involves a small incision under your nose to lift the upper lip and reveal more of your upper teeth. This can help to reduce the appearance of lines around your mouth and create a more balanced facial appearance. It’s a slightly more involved procedure than dermal fillers, but it can provide longer-lasting results. Regarding pain, both procedures involve some discomfort, but we can use topical numbing cream to minimize any pain. With dermal fillers, you might feel a slight pinching sensation. With a lip lift, you’ll likely feel some pressure and discomfort during the procedure, but we can provide local anesthesia to keep you comfortable. As for how long the results last, dermal fillers typically last between six to twelve months, depending on the type of filler used and your individual metabolism. A lip lift can provide longer-lasting results, typically several years, but it’s not permanent and may require touch-up procedures in the future. Does that help to clarify things a bit, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much clearer, thank you, Doctor. Hyaluronic acid… not permanent… topical numbing cream… What about risks? Are there any potential side effects or complications with either procedure? I’ve heard… stories, you know. And I’m a bit worried about looking… unnatural. I don’t want to end up looking like a different person. I just want to look like… myself, but a little bit younger.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Brightful. It’s important to be aware of the potential risks and complications with any medical procedure. With dermal fillers, the most common side effects are temporary bruising, swelling, and redness at the injection site. These usually resolve within a few days. More rare but serious complications include infection, allergic reaction, and vascular occlusion, which is when the filler blocks a blood vessel. However, these complications are very rare when the procedure is performed by a qualified and experienced practitioner. With a lip lift, the potential risks include infection, bleeding, scarring, and nerve damage. Again, these complications are rare when the procedure is performed by a qualified practitioner. As for looking unnatural, that's a risk that can be minimized by choosing an experienced practitioner who understands facial anatomy and has a good aesthetic eye. It's important to have realistic expectations and to communicate your goals clearly to your practitioner. We want to enhance your natural beauty, not change it. I always prioritize a natural-looking result, and I would never perform a procedure that I didn’t feel would be in your best interest. I would discuss the potential risks and benefits with you in detail before proceeding with any procedure. We would also take before-and-after photos to ensure that you’re happy with the results. Does that address your concerns, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Yes… that does help, thank you, Doctor. Knowing about the potential risks… and hearing that you prioritize a natural look… that’s reassuring. What would be the next step? Would I need to have any tests or anything before proceeding? And how much would either procedure cost? I’m on a fixed income, so I need to be mindful of my finances.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. That’s perfectly reasonable. The next step would be a consultation where we discuss your goals in more detail and assess your facial anatomy. We'd also review your medical history to ensure you're a good candidate for either procedure. We generally don’t require any specific tests before these procedures, unless you have underlying medical conditions. As for the cost, dermal fillers typically range from $600 to $1000 per syringe, depending on the type of filler used and the amount needed. A lip lift typically ranges from $1500 to $3000, depending on the complexity of the procedure. I understand that you’re on a fixed income, and I’m happy to discuss financing options with you. We offer payment plans, and we also have partnerships with several financing companies that can help to make the procedures more affordable. We can also start with a smaller amount of filler to see how you respond to the treatment before committing to a larger procedure. We can always add more filler later if you’re happy with the results. Would you like to schedule a consultation to discuss these options in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A consultation would be lovely. Starting with a smaller amount of filler sounds… less daunting. And discussing financing options would be very helpful. When would you be available? And… is there anything I should bring to the consultation? Perhaps photos of how I looked when I was younger?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see… I have availability next Tuesday at 2:30 PM, or Thursday at 10:00 AM. Would either of those times work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:30 PM would be perfect. And… photos would be helpful, if I can find any! I’m not very organized, I’m afraid. But I’ll do my best. Is there anything else I should prepare? I'm truly grateful for your patience and understanding, Doctor. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Tuesday at 2:30 PM it is. As for preparation, just bring any photos you have of how you looked in the past, if you can find them. It’s helpful to have a visual reference of your goals. Otherwise, just come as you are, and we’ll discuss everything in detail. And please, don’t worry about being organized. We’re here to help you achieve your goals, and we’ll work with you every step of the way. I’ll have my receptionist, Sarah, contact you to confirm the appointment and send you any necessary paperwork. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your kindness. I feel much more at ease now. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could put you at ease. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday as well. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions before then. Have a wonderful day, and travel safely. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a wonderful day as well. .
