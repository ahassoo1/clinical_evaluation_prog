DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascasndola. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it's been swelling up. It's mostly my right one, but sometimes the left one gets a bit puffy too. It's been going on for… oh, let me think… a couple weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple weeks of swelling in your feet. Mostly the right, but the left one gets puffy sometimes. And can you tell me a little more about the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing. It just… gets bigger throughout the day. In the morning it might look okay, or just a little bit off. But by evening, after I’ve been on my feet at work, it’s pretty noticeable. It doesn’t really hurt, exactly. More like… heavy. And a little bit tight. I can still walk, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s gradual, worse at the end of the day after being on your feet, and feels heavy and tight, not painful. Is it just the feet that swell, or do you notice any swelling anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Sometimes my ankles get a little puffy too, when the feet are bad. Not always, but… yeah, the ankles sometimes. And… now that you mention it, my hands feel a bit stiff in the mornings, but I just thought that was from… well, getting older, you know? I don’t know if that’s the same thing. It’s not swelling swelling, like the feet, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ankles as well, and some morning stiffness in your hands. That’s helpful. And just to clarify, is the stiffness in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both hands, Doctor. Not terrible, mind you. I can still do everything. But when I first wake up, they feel… creaky, maybe? Like they need to get moving. It goes away pretty quick after I make some tea and start puttering around. It's just… there. And it seems worse when it’s cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. So both hands with morning stiffness that improves with activity and is worse in the cold. Now, let's talk about other things going on with your health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never been told anything like that. I go to work, come home, try to eat okay… never really had a lot of trouble. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Just for check-ups, maybe, years ago. Nothing serious ever came up. I don’t take any pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and no current medications. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Nope. Not a fan, if I can avoid it! Just a couple of broken bones when I was a kid, a long time ago. A wrist, I think, and maybe an arm. But they healed up fine, all on their own. Nothing recently, though. Definitely no surgeries.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, just some childhood broken bones. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of swelling, arthritis, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… they’re mostly back in Somalia, and we don't talk much anymore. It's complicated. My mother, she had… something with her legs, I think. But I was pretty young, and I don't really remember what it was. She used to complain about them being tired and achy. And my uncle… he had trouble with his heart, I think, but I didn't see him much either. So, I’m not really sure. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's not something we ever talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's perfectly alright. So, limited family history available. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a bad habit. My mother… she didn’t approve of it. And I never really got started, thankfully. I drink tea, though. Lots of it! Mostly black tea, with a little bit of sugar. But no cigarettes, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, just tea. And how much tea would you say you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably… four or five cups? Maybe more on a cold day. It's a habit, you know? I make a pot in the morning and just… sip on it throughout the day. It's not anything fancy, just regular black tea. I do add a little sugar, though. Maybe two spoons per cup. I should probably cut back, but… it's comforting, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, four to five cups of black tea with about two teaspoons of sugar per cup. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I mean, I might sneeze sometimes if there’s a lot of dust, but that’s about it. No known allergies, no. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to take a look at your feet and ankles. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. There you go. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascasndola. I’m going to gently feel around your feet and ankles. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Okay, your pulses feel a little weak, but present in both feet. I notice some mild swelling on both ankles and feet, more pronounced on the right, as you mentioned. Your skin feels warm and dry. There's no redness or open wounds. I don’t feel any significant pain when I move your foot up and down and side to side. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. Okay. Now, let's sit up for a moment and I’ll take a look at your hands.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. All sounds… okay, I guess? It doesn’t hurt when you touch it, just feels a bit puffy. I can feel it getting worse throughout the day, but it's not like a sharp pain or anything. And yeah, I noticed my hands feel a bit… stiff, like you said. Let me show you. See? It’s not terrible, but it's definitely there. Especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There's some mild stiffness and limited range of motion in both hands. No redness or swelling that I can see, but the movement is a bit restricted. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis, possibly combined with some mild fluid retention. The diminished reflexes could be related to that, or something else. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out other possible causes, such as kidney problems or rheumatoid arthritis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Sounds… serious. But okay, if you think it's best, Doctor. I’d rather know what's going on than just… wonder about it. I don’t really like needles, but I can manage. What kind of tests are we talking about? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It’s good you asked about the cost. We'll be looking at a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a rheumatoid factor test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis. There's also a uric acid level test, which can help rule out gout. As for the cost, I’ll be honest, it can be expensive without insurance. I can put in a request for a financial assistance form for you at the lab, and they may be able to offer a discount. We can also discuss which tests are absolutely necessary and prioritize those if needed. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s causing your swelling and stiffness, and rule out anything serious. It's better to be proactive, even if it means a little discomfort and some paperwork. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… reasonable. Financial assistance would be good, very good. I don’t want to get myself into debt over this, you see. And… prioritizing the important ones sounds smart. I appreciate you explaining it all so clearly, Doctor. I’m still a little worried, but… I feel better knowing we’re trying to figure it out. So, yes, let’s do the tests. And… could you give me a little slip of paper with what tests you want done, just in case I get confused at the lab? Old man’s brain, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly understandable to be worried, and no problem at all. I’m happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. And yes, I’ll write down the tests for you. Here you go. This lists the tests I'm ordering: Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel, Rheumatoid Factor, and Uric Acid. The lab will take it from there. They’ll need to draw some blood, and it may take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to elevate your feet whenever possible, and if you’re experiencing any discomfort, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re not allergic to them. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Okay, got it. Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel… sounds complicated. Ibuprofen, I think I’ve used that before, no problem. And… elevating my feet. Okay, I can do that. It’s not much, but it's something. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really well, Doctor. Thank you for not making me feel like an idiot. And for trying to help with the cost. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll go to the lab and get this done. When should I call to schedule the follow-up? After I get the results back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. And you’re definitely not an idiot - you’re just trying to take care of yourself, and that's commendable. Yes, call the office after you’ve had the results sent to us. The lab will let you know when they’re available, and then you can give us a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. I usually see patients within a week or two, depending on availability. My nurse, Sarah, will be able to help you with that. And if you experience any sudden or severe worsening of your symptoms, like a lot of pain, redness, or fever, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Here’s my card with the office number. Feel free to call if you have any questions in the meantime. I'm glad I could help. Get those tests done, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. Have a good day, Mr. Parascasndola.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate everything. Bye now.
