DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I’m already on a blood thinner. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Bruising, even while on a blood thinner… yes, that is concerning. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it started maybe a week ago? Small bruises, like you get normally. But then they just… kept appearing. And they’re bigger now, and some of them are really sore. I bumped my arm on the table yesterday, just a little tap, and it’s already turning purple. It doesn’t usually be like that. I haven’t changed anything about my routine, or anything I’m eating. I’m taking the medicine exactly how the last doctor told me to.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the bruising is increasing in frequency and severity, despite being on a blood thinner. And it’s happening with minimal trauma, even a light bump. You said you haven’t made any changes to your diet or medication routine, and you're taking it as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Exactly. No changes at all. I even double-checked the bottle this morning to be sure I hadn’t accidentally messed up a dose, but no. It’s the same amount, same time as always. It’s just… weird. And kinda scary, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. It is unusual, and we need to figure out what's going on. Let's go through some other things. Do you have any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t felt particularly tired, or anything like that. My gums don’t bleed more than usual when I brush. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have noticed a couple of nosebleeds this week. Small ones, but I don't usually get those. They stopped pretty quickly with a little pressure. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Nosebleeds, even small ones, are relevant. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… high blood pressure, that’s why I’m on the blood thinner in the first place. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was ages ago and didn’t cause any trouble since. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well and get a bit of walking in when I can. Nothing major, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with a blood thinner, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Any family history of bleeding disorders, or easy bruising?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. My mum… she used to bruise easily, now that I think about it. But she just put it down to getting older. No one ever really talked about it being anything serious, though. And I don’t know about anyone else, really. My dad passed away when I was young, and I didn't keep in touch with much of his side of the family. So… probably not, but I’m not sure. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for family history to be unclear. Okay, let's quickly go through your medications. Besides the blood thinner, are you taking any other pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood thinner, Doctor. And a multivitamin, but I’ve been taking that for years, same brand. Nothing new at all. I’m really trying to think, but I haven’t changed anything. This is… frustrating. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Courtnye. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some potential causes and what tests we might need to run. Can you please roll up your sleeves and pant legs a bit for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see bruising on both arms and legs, varying in color from reddish-purple to a darker blue. There doesn’t appear to be any swelling or warmth around the bruises, which is good. No tenderness to palpation, and no obvious lumps or bumps. Your pulses feel strong and regular. Now, let's take a listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I’m a bit nervous, if I'm being honest. I really don’t like going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Courtnye. No murmurs or wheezing. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, and then we can talk about what might be going on and what tests we should consider. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I get a bit worried about that part, to be honest. It's good to know I don’t have to worry about that, though. Is this something serious, Doctor? I mean, you're asking a lot of questions...
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you don’t have any medication allergies. And you’re right to be concerned, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're experiencing something unusual. The questions are to help me build a complete picture and ensure we don't miss anything. Based on what you've told me – the increased bruising despite being on a blood thinner, the nosebleeds, and the family history – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. One possibility is that your current blood thinner isn’t at the optimal dose, or that something is interfering with how it works. Another possibility is a condition affecting your blood platelets, or even a more rare bleeding disorder. We need some blood tests to help figure out what's going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yeah, okay. If that’s what we need to do. I just want to know what’s happening, so yes. Please. Anything to figure this out. I just… I don't want anything serious, you know? I’m a single mum, I need to be okay. It's just me and my daughter.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Courtnye. And we will figure this out. We’ll start with a complete blood count, which will tell us about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We’ll also check your coagulation studies to see how well your blood is clotting. I’ll also order a peripheral blood smear, which allows us to look at your blood cells under a microscope. These tests should give us a good starting point. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take too long. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. That usually takes a couple of days, depending on the lab's workload. In the meantime, if you notice any significant bleeding – heavy nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or any unexpected bruising – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A couple of days… alright. No, I think I’m good for now. Just… please call as soon as you know something. I’ll try not to worry too much, but it's hard. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. And I understand your anxiety. I will call you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, try to take things easy, and please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns at all. Here’s a lab requisition for the blood tests. The lab technician will take it from here. Let's get those tests ordered, and we'll take it from there. And remember, we're in this together.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I’m going to go get those done now. I hope everything is okay.
