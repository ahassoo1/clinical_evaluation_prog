DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Alzoubi, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having the chills on and off for a couple of days now. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not like a fever chill, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills coming and going for a couple of days. And you said not like a fever chill, so no associated high temperature?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. That’s what’s throwing me off. I haven’t even bothered to take my temperature, to be honest, because I didn’t feel hot, just…shaky and cold. Like when you’re really surprised but it lasts a little while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shaky and cold, lasting a bit. And has anything else been going on alongside the chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a tiny bit tired, I guess. More tired than usual, but I thought that was just because it’s been hot out, and I’ve been trying to stay inside. No cough, no sore throat, nothing like that. Just the chills and a bit of fatigue.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other cold or flu-like symptoms, just the chills and fatigue. How would you rate the fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being hardly noticeable and 10 being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Probably a 4 or 5, I’d say. I can still do things, you know? I went to the grocery store yesterday. It's just… afterwards I felt like I needed a nap. It's not stopping me from doing things, just making me want to rest more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 4 or 5, so noticeable but not interfering significantly. And have you noticed any other symptoms – any aches, pains, headaches, digestive issues, or anything at all out of the ordinary?
PATIENT: No aches or headaches, thankfully. My stomach's been okay too, a little… sluggish maybe? But I haven't really paid much attention to it. I sometimes get a bit of indigestion anyway, so I just thought it was that. Nothing new, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. So sluggish digestion, but nothing new there. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: No traveling, thankfully! It’s been too hot to even think about going anywhere. And no, I don't think I've been around anyone sick. My ex-husband’s kid was a little sniffly last week when I dropped off the kids, but that was just a normal little cold, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any pre-existing health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was a little anemic when I was a teenager, but it went away on its own. Nothing diagnosed currently. I try to eat pretty healthy, exercise when I can… you know, the usual. My divorce was pretty stressful for a while, but I'm getting better at managing that now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medical conditions, past anemia that resolved, and managing stress well. Any family history of significant medical illnesses – things like heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my grandpa on my dad's side had some heart problems when he was older. My aunt on my mom’s side has… I think it was rheumatoid arthritis? But other than that, nothing major that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so maternal history of hypertension, paternal history of heart problems, and aunt with rheumatoid arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it! And no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken ibuprofen and stuff before without any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications and no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good! Please do. I'm happy to get it checked out properly. I've just been worried it was something silly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Temperature is 98.6 – normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let me just take a look at your ears… Ears look clear. And now your throat… Throat appears slightly red, but no obvious signs of infection. Palpating your lymph nodes now... Lymph nodes are not significantly enlarged.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reassuring? Everything sounds normal, which is good. Is there anything… concerning? Or is this just… one of those things?
DOCTOR: The physical exam doesn't reveal a clear cause for your symptoms. The slightly red throat isn’t concerning in the absence of other signs of infection. Considering your symptoms – chills, fatigue, normal temperature, and clear exam – it could be a mild viral illness, or possibly a reaction to the heat, or even just stress. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. It's just to be thorough. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, I’m happy to do those tests. Are they… painful or anything? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Not at all painful, just a standard blood draw. The phlebotomist will quickly take a few vials of blood. As for results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the lab to send them over. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and managing your stress levels. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing – please seek immediate medical attention. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense. Rest, hydrate, manage stress, and call if anything gets worse. And I’ll wait for the call with the results. Thank you, Dr. Alzoubi. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. It's a little scary when you feel off and don't know why, so it's good to have it checked. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’re here to help with that. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any new concerns arise or if your symptoms change. Have a good day, Jailenne, and we'll be in touch soon.
