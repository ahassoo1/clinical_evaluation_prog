DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a… pleasure, I suppose. I need a card. A get-well card, you understand? My niece, she’s… not feeling so good. And a card from the doctor… well, that means something, doesn’t it? Shows I care. It’s important to have these things, you know? A little encouragement goes a long way.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. You’d like a card from me for your niece. That’s very thoughtful of you. While I’m happy to support you in showing your care, my role here is to provide medical attention. Perhaps we can talk about your niece’s situation a little, and I can offer some general encouragement based on what’s happening with her health?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. I don’t need medical attention, Doctor. I’m perfectly fine. It’s her that needs attention, and a nice card. I just thought… you being a doctor, a card from you would be… official. More meaningful. I don’t want to bother you with details. It’s just… a card. Do you write them or not? That's all I need to know, really.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re not here seeking care for yourself, but would like me to write a card for your niece. I understand. While it’s not a typical request, I don’t mind helping. However, even for a card, knowing a little bit about why your niece is unwell could help me write something more supportive and appropriate. Is she seeing a doctor?
PATIENT: Well, yes, she's seeing a doctor. A young one, fresh out of school, I think. Doesn't seem to know much, honestly. That’s why I want your card. It shows I'm taking things seriously. She's got… a cough. A bad one. And tired, always tired. But these young doctors, they just poke and prod and give her pills. No real encouragement, you see? Just… medicine. Is that enough information for your card? A cough and tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. A cough and fatigue. It’s understandable you want to offer extra support, and it’s good of you to be so involved in your niece’s care. While I can certainly write a card mentioning a cough and fatigue, it’s important to remember I haven’t examined your niece. Is she being evaluated for the cause of her cough and tiredness?
PATIENT: Evaluated? She goes to the doctor, doesn’t she? What more evaluation does she need? They listen to her chest, take her temperature… the usual. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand all the fancy terms. She needs a little hope, a little encouragement. A card from you would do just fine. Are you going to write it or not? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It's good you're advocating for your niece. While a card is a lovely gesture, a persistent cough and fatigue can have many causes, some of which require specific treatment. Just to be sure, and to help me write a card that's truly supportive, could you tell me roughly how long she's been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a while. A couple of months, maybe? It started mild, just a little tickle in her throat. Then it got worse. She’s always been a bit of a worrier, my niece. Gets stressed easily. That probably doesn’t help. But a couple of months, I think. Maybe three. It’s hard to say exactly. I just want her to feel better. And a card… well, it's a nice thing to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. That’s helpful. A cough lasting three months is considered chronic, and fatigue alongside it deserves investigation. While I’m happy to write a card, I’m a bit concerned that the underlying cause hasn’t been identified. It could be something relatively simple, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Has her doctor mentioned anything about chest X-rays, blood tests, or a possible referral to a specialist like a pulmonologist?
PATIENT: Pulmo… what now? No, no specialists. Just pills. Lots of pills. And told her to rest. She’s a school teacher, Doctor! How much rest can she get? And X-rays? No. Just… listened to her chest. I tell you, these young doctors… they don’t take things seriously enough. That’s why I came to you. Look, are you going to write the card or not? I don't want to sit here all day discussing pills and… what was it? A pulmonologist?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you’re very concerned about your niece’s care, and you’re right to advocate for her. I’m happy to write the card, and I will. But as a doctor, I also feel obligated to express my concern that a three-month cough with fatigue hasn't been fully investigated. Before I write the card, could I just ask you a few more questions about her symptoms?
PATIENT: Fine. Ask your questions. But I'm telling you, it's just a cough. A bad cough. And she’s tired. It’s probably just stress. School teachers, you know? Always worried about something. But go ahead. Ask away. I haven’t got anything better to do, I suppose. Just… keep it brief.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Has she had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. Not that I recall. She might have felt a little warm sometimes, but nothing serious. No chills, no… night sweats. She sleeps alright, as far as I know. She worries a lot, so she’s probably always a little warm from that. But no, no fever, no chills, no sweating. Just a cough. And tired. Is that enough yet?
DOCTOR: Okay. And has she noticed any weight loss, or any changes in her appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it… she has been eating a little less, I think. But she's always been petite. A little bird, you know? She doesn't have much of an appetite anyway. So it's hard to say if she's actually lost weight. But maybe a little. Not much, but… maybe. It’s hard to say. She's a school teacher, Doctor! She doesn’t have time to eat properly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has she been experiencing any shortness of breath, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… no. Not that I’ve noticed. She walks around fine. Chest pain… hmm. She does complain about feeling a little… tight in her chest sometimes. But she says it’s probably just stress. She worries about her students, you know? Always takes her work home with her. So, yeah, a little tight, but no real pain. It’s probably just her nerves. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like your niece is a very dedicated teacher, and it’s understandable she’s stressed. However, a three-month cough with fatigue, coupled with occasional chest tightness, warrants further investigation to rule out anything serious. While I’m happy to write the card, I strongly recommend she see a pulmonologist for a more thorough evaluation. I can write a referral for you, and I’ll include a note detailing her symptoms and my concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… pulmo-whatsit? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But she doesn’t need more doctors poking and prodding. She needs encouragement! A nice card. And maybe a little rest. That’s all. No referrals, no specialists. Just write the card. A simple get-well card. It says a lot, you know. More than any test or… pulmo-thingy. And frankly, I'm starting to feel a little… insulted that you're not taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel that I’m not taking your concerns seriously. I assure you, I am. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to advocate for the best possible care for all my patients, even when it means having difficult conversations. While I respect your decision to decline a referral at this time, I strongly encourage you to reconsider. A simple evaluation could provide peace of mind, or identify a treatable condition. However, I will honor your wishes and write the card. What message would you like me to include?
PATIENT: Fine. Write the card. Just… something encouraging. Tell her to take it easy. Tell her I’m thinking of her. And tell her… tell her she’s doing a good job. She worries too much about her students. That’s all. Keep it simple. No medical talk. Just… kindness. And make it a nice card, will you? Something with flowers.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will write a card with those sentiments – encouragement, rest, and a message of support from you. Something with flowers, as you requested. "Dear [Niece’s Name], I was so sorry to hear you’re not feeling well. Your uncle is thinking of you and sending his warmest wishes for a speedy recovery. He wants you to remember to take things easy and prioritize your health. He’s very proud of your dedication to your students and wants you to know you’re doing a wonderful job. With heartfelt wishes, Dr. Vodzak” Is that to your liking?
PATIENT: Flowers… good. And the message… yes, that’s… acceptable. It’s a little formal, but… yes. That will do. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. And your… kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad I could help, even in a small way. Please remember, if your niece’s symptoms worsen or don’t improve, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Wishing you and your niece all the best. .
