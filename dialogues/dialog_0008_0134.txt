DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's been… a bit of a bother, really. I just haven't been keepin’ much down lately, and I get full awful quick when I do eat. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly… time slips away from me these days. But it’s worryin’ me some.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some nausea and early fullness. "A little while now" is helpful, but can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear, specifics… that’s… hard. Let me think. It started… maybe around springtime? Or was it after my birthday? March… April… I always did love the dogwoods in April. But no, I think it was after that big rain we had. So… maybe May? June? It's all a bit fuzzy. It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually got worse. I just thought it was somethin’ I ate at first, you know? Old lady problems, mostly. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly starting in May or June, a gradual onset of nausea and early fullness. And it hasn’t improved with time. Are you having any pain with eating, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like a fullness that just won't go away. Sometimes a little bit of a cramp, low down, but nothin' terrible. It’s mostly just… unpleasant. Makes me not want to eat, which isn’t good, I suppose. I do love my cookin’, you know. Used to train the animals with little bits of treats... used to have a real knack for it. But now… not so much appetite.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort and early fullness, sometimes with mild cramping. And a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, what else… I've been a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But then, at my age, what isn't usual? And… oh! I have been losin’ a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven’t weighed myself, not recently. I just noticed things weren’t fittin’ quite the same. Now, what else… I don’t rightly recall. My memory ain’t what it used to be, bless its heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and unintentional weight loss along with the nausea, early fullness, and cramping. Ms. Kelder, do you have any difficulty swallowing, or has your stool appearance changed at all recently?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowin’… no, not really. I can eat just fine, it’s what happens after that’s the problem. As for… stool… oh dear. I don’t really pay much attention to that sort of thing, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so. I just know it’s… well, regular enough, I suppose. Not different than usual. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s hard to remember. I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m just not a very good reporter, am I?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You're doing just fine. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not in my memory. I take a little somethin' for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it years ago, and that's about it. I don't recall ever bein' allergic to food either. I eat most things, although I don’t care for okra much. It’s just… slimy, you know? But that’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're on medication for high blood pressure. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. I've been takin' it so long… it's a little white pill, I think. Small, and I take it every mornin’ with my breakfast. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the road, you know, Mrs. Gable's place? She's a sweet girl, always remembers my name. I just… don't recall the name of the pill itself. I’m so sorry, Doctor. My mind just doesn’t hold onto things like that anymore. Is it alright if we just skip that one?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kelder. We can skip it for now. I can look it up in your records. Now, has anyone in your family had similar issues – nausea, stomach problems, weight loss – or any history of cancer, particularly stomach or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a long story. My mama, she had a bit of a weak stomach, always complainin’ of heartburn. And my uncle, Earl… he passed away a long time ago, but I think he had somethin’ with his bowels. But I don’t rightly know what it was. Now, cancer… My cousin, Bessie, she had breast cancer, but she’s doin’ alright now, been years since her treatment. And… oh, my brother, James… he had colon cancer, years back. Didn’t make it. It was… a sad time. But that was a long time ago, before I met my husband, I reckon. It's all a bit fuzzy now, bless its heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of stomach issues, colon cancer in your brother James. Now, Ms. Kelder, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh dear. What does that mean exactly? I mean, I lived on a small farm most of my life, raised animals... dogs mostly, loved trainin’ 'em. Had a good husband, bless his soul, passed away ten years ago now. We didn't have much, but we had each other. I don’t really… go anywhere much anymore. Mostly just stay home with my animals. It's quiet, peaceful. I used to go to church sometimes, but… not so much lately. I don’t really have much of a social life, I suppose. Just me and the critters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet lifestyle, mostly at home with animals. No significant social activities. Now, before we move on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I don’t mind at all. Just… be gentle, please. My insides are a bit delicate these days. And I might be a little cold, I always get chilly easily. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Sounds are… diminished, but no acute abnormalities. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… definitely feels somethin’. Here, on the upper right… and maybe a bit over here, on the left. It’s… hard to explain. Just a dull ache, really. Like somethin’s… swollen. It’s worse when you press on it, though. It’s just… a bit sensitive. And I feel a little… full, even though I haven’t eaten much today.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm feeling some tenderness in both upper quadrants, more pronounced on the right side. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your liver and spleen don’t feel enlarged. Now, I’m going to check for any masses. No palpable masses. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, Ms. Kelder. That gives me a little more information. Given your symptoms – nausea, early fullness, weight loss, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen – I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us check your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of infection or anemia. The CT scan will give us a better look at your stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and other organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds… serious. Blood work and a CT scan… Is it somethin’ bad, Doctor? I just want to feel better, you know? I don’t want any trouble. If you think it’s necessary, though… then yes, I suppose. If it’ll help find out what’s wrong, then do what you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please tell me what’s goin’ on, alright? I don’t like bein’ in the dark.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, I understand your concerns. It’s good we’re taking these steps to investigate. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's something serious, but it's important to rule out any potential problems. The symptoms you’re describing could be caused by a number of things, from something relatively minor like gastritis to something more serious. The blood work and CT scan will help us narrow down the possibilities. I’ll explain everything to you as soon as I have the results. We'll start with the blood work. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood right away. Then we’ll schedule the CT scan for you. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I’ve never had a CT scan before, so I’ve never had any dye or anything like that. I just… don’t know. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… I’m not sure. Is it something I should worry about? I just get so nervous with all these medical things. It’s all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, it's understandable to be nervous. We’ll take things one step at a time. The contrast dye is sometimes used to help visualize certain organs on the CT scan. It's generally safe, but some people can have an allergic reaction. That's why I ask. If you have a history of allergies, or asthma, or kidney problems, it's more important to be cautious. Since you don't recall any allergies, we can proceed, but please let the radiology technician know if you start feeling any itching, hives, or difficulty breathing after the dye is administered. They'll be monitoring you closely. I’ll write the orders for the blood work and CT scan now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and she can give you instructions for scheduling the CT scan. Are there any questions I can answer for you before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a lot to take in. No, I don’t think so. Just… try to be quick with the blood work, alright? And thank you, Doctor, for explainin’ everything so patiently. I appreciate it. I just… I just want to feel like myself again. Tell you what, I think I’ll just sit here for a bit and try to calm my nerves. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. I understand. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this together. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to let her know if you have any concerns. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available.
