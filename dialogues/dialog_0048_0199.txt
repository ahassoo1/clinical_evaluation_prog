DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Chayer, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Marquie Chayer. Look, doc, I gotta be honest, I don’t really… remember a lot of things clearly. Just trying to get this sorted quickly if that’s alright? I just… get really winded now, and it’s worrying my wife.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, brevity is appreciated. Though "not remembering things clearly" isn’t exactly helpful for a medical history. Winded, you say?
PATIENT: Right, I know, I know. It's… frustrating for everyone. It's just… happened gradually. Like, I used to be able to walk up the stairs no problem, now… I have to stop halfway up. It’s been getting worse the last few months, I think. Maybe six months? It’s hard to pinpoint. Just… short of breath, easily tired. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: “Gradually worsening shortness of breath for six months.” Vague, but we'll proceed. Any chest pain with this?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Uh… not really. Not like a sharp pain, no. Sometimes… a tightness, maybe? More like… pressure, I guess? It comes and goes. It doesn’t feel like… a heart attack or anything. I don't think so, anyway. I really don't know much about that sort of thing. I just get tired and can't breathe properly, and that’s what's bothering me.
DOCTOR: “Pressure.” Alright. And does anything specific bring this on?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Walking, definitely. Like I said, stairs are bad. Even just… walking to the mailbox. Sometimes it happens when I’m… stressed, I think? Or if it’s really hot and humid. It's been pretty bad lately with the weather. I work outside, you see… with the water treatment plant. Heavy work sometimes. That doesn’t help, I guess.
DOCTOR: Water treatment… exposure to any unusual chemicals?
PATIENT: Unusual chemicals? Doc, we treat water, right? Chlorine, stuff like that. Standard stuff. I mean, we have safety protocols, we wear gear... I haven't had any major incidents, if that’s what you’re asking. I've been doing this for a while now. I think I'd know if something was really wrong. But honestly, I’m not a chemist. We get told what to use, and we use it. I'm more of the hands-on guy, keeping things running. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly. Let’s move on. Any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Not really a constant cough, no. Sometimes, if I'm really winded, I get a bit of a… hacking cough, I suppose. Just trying to clear my lungs. It doesn’t bring anything up, if that makes sense. It's not a productive cough, my wife says. It just… happens when I'm struggling to breathe. It's not every time, though. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath… and another… Okay. Sounds… relatively clear. Though, frankly, your weight is quite low for your height. Any history of asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh. Yeah, I know. I haven’t been eating great, to be honest. Stress, you know? Work, worrying about things… History? Not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. As a kid, maybe a few colds, but nothing serious. My wife keeps telling me to see a doctor, she worries. I just… put it off. It's hard to get time off, you see. And… well, I forget things. I probably didn't even mention half of what's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Right. And any family history of heart problems or lung disease?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And… he smoked for years. But he died of a heart attack when I was young, so… I guess that’s something. My mother was healthy, as far as I know. No lung problems, not that I remember. We didn’t really… talk much about medical stuff. It wasn’t really her thing. Sorry, I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: Adequate. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take some ibuprofen for aches and pains from work. Nothing regular. I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. My wife keeps some vitamins, but I forget to take those too. Honestly, I try to just push through things. It’s probably not the smartest thing, but… it's how I've always done it. It's hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes. Alright. Let's get a quick blood pressure and oxygen level. Then we can discuss some possibilities. Though, frankly, it sounds like deconditioning and perhaps some anxiety. We’ll rule out anything serious first.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again, you know? And stop feeling like I'm going to collapse every time I walk up the stairs. Let's get this over with. Blood pressure and oxygen level, right? Sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is... elevated, but not critically so. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable. It's consistent with some mild exertion, and your reported symptoms. I’m going to order a chest x-ray just to be thorough, and a complete blood count. .
PATIENT: Okay, sure, that sounds… reasonable. Chest X-ray and blood count. Fine. When do I need to go for those? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, anything I should avoid? Look, doc, I really gotta get back to work. My wife's gonna kill me if I'm gone all day.
