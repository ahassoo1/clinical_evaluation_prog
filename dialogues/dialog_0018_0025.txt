DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... well, I want to know about my family. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test... with spit? To find out? I want to see if I can find out more about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re interested in exploring your ancestry through genetic testing. That’s certainly something we can discuss, and it's becoming increasingly popular. It is done with a saliva sample, typically. Before we proceed with ordering any tests, however, it’s important to understand what these tests can and cannot tell us. They can provide information about your ethnic origins and potential relatives, but they don’t give a complete picture, and results can sometimes be complex to interpret. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what you already know about your family history?
PATIENT: Well... I grew up on Majuro. My papa... he told me stories. We always been Marshallese, you know? But he said, long time ago, people came from other islands. Maybe even further. He didn't say where exactly. Just... not always Majuro. That’s why I want the test. To see if it can show me. I don’t know much past my papa and grandma. They're both gone now. It’s a long time ago. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. It’s very common to have gaps in family history, especially when stories are passed down through generations. Your papa’s recollections are a wonderful starting point, though. So, you're interested in learning more about your ancestral origins beyond your Marshallese heritage. That’s a perfectly valid and worthwhile goal. Before we talk about the specifics of genetic testing, I'd like to ask a few standard medical history questions, if you don't mind. It's just to ensure I have a complete picture of your health and to rule out any contraindications for the test. It will also help me interpret any findings in the context of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s fine. Ask away, Doctor. I don't really get sick much. Old bones, that’s all. But ask if you need to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Scobie. “Old bones,” as you say, is good to know. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. Doctor told me a long time ago, when I was younger, my blood pressure was a little high, but I stopped eating so much salt and it went down. He said it was okay. Just watch the salt. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy. Never been in the hospital, except when my leg broke when I was a boy. Fell out of a coconut tree!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Scobie, and a very sensible approach to managing your blood pressure. And a rather adventurous childhood, it sounds like! Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. Everything still works... mostly! I’m a pretty simple man. Never needed much fixing. Just a few aches and pains, like anyone my age.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And that’s perfectly normal for someone your age, Mr. Scobie. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my bones. The doctor said they get weak, you know? Makes them stronger. I take one every day. And sometimes, if my knee hurts real bad, I take something for the pain. But not all the time. Just when I need it. It’s... Ibuprofen, I think? The white pills.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Scobie. So, you take a medication for bone health, and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your bones?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. The bottle is at home... It’s… the one that says… Calcium with Vitamin D? Is that it? Doctor said it helps with the bones. Small, white pill. I take it with my breakfast. I’m not so good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: Calcium with Vitamin D is a very common medication for bone health, Mr. Scobie. That sounds right. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with anything like that. I eat everything. I like fish, mostly. And taro. Good, simple food. My grandma taught me how to cook. No, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a hard one. Like I said, my grandma and papa didn't talk much about sickness. I remember my uncle… he had trouble breathing when he got old. Real bad coughing. But other than that… not really. Everyone just… got old. And tired. I think my cousin… on my mama’s side… had something bad with her stomach, a long time ago. But I don’t know what it was. It was before my time. It’s hard to remember… everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. Family history can be difficult to recall, especially when details are limited. It sounds like there may have been some respiratory issues and potentially a stomach problem on your mother’s side, but it’s not definitive. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. My papa always said it was bad for you. He chewed betel nut sometimes, but I never liked it. Makes your mouth all red. No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Clean living, that’s what I always try to do.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Scobie. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not much. Sometimes, with my friends, we have a little beer. Just on special occasions. Nothing heavy. A little one, maybe two. Mostly, I drink water. Good for you. Keeps you going. Not a big drinker, no.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, could you tell me about your current living situation?
PATIENT: I live in a small house near the ocean. With my nephew’s family. They take good care of me. It’s quiet there. Lots of sunshine. I mostly stay home, read books, and watch the ocean. I used to work, making little boats, you know? Wood boats. But my hands aren’t so steady anymore. Now I just enjoy the peace and quiet. It's a good life. Simple, but good.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Scobie. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, regarding your interest in genetic ancestry testing, there are several reputable companies that offer this service. They typically require a saliva sample, which you provide at home and mail back to the lab. The results can take several weeks to process. It’s important to understand that these tests are not 100% accurate, and the interpretation of the results can be complex. They can provide information about your ethnic origins, potential relatives, and some genetic predispositions, but they cannot tell you everything about your family history. Also, it's important to be aware of potential privacy concerns, as your genetic information will be stored in a database. Would you like me to provide you with information about some of these companies, and we can discuss the pros and cons of each one?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. I’ve heard some of them cost a lot of money. I don’t want to spend too much. And like you said, I don't want anyone knowing my secrets! Just want to know where my family comes from. Not tell everyone.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Scobie. Your privacy is very important. I can certainly provide you with information about several companies, and we can focus on those with strong privacy policies and reasonable costs. Here are a few reputable options: 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage DNA. 23andMe often has sales, making it more affordable. AncestryDNA is known for its extensive family tree resources, but it’s generally more expensive. MyHeritage DNA also offers family tree building. They all have websites with detailed information about their services, privacy policies, and costs. I can print out some brochures for you to review, and we can discuss your options further. I also want to emphasize that these tests should not be used for medical decision-making. If you have any concerns about your health, it’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional. Before we proceed with ordering a test, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… Is it painful? Taking the spit? And… what if it says something I don’t want to know? Like… someone did something bad? Will the police come? I’m a good man, Doctor. I don’t want trouble.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Scobie. Absolutely valid concerns. No, taking the saliva sample is not painful at all. It's similar to spitting into a cup – a very simple process. They provide clear instructions, and it takes just a few minutes. And regarding your concerns about discovering something unsettling, it's important to understand that these tests primarily focus on ancestral origins and ethnic heritage. They are not designed to uncover criminal activity or personal secrets. The information they provide is about your genetic makeup and potential relatives – things like where your ancestors came from, what ethnic groups you may be related to, and some potential predispositions to certain traits. The police will not come. Your genetic information is protected by privacy laws, and the companies are required to adhere to strict confidentiality guidelines. You have complete control over your data and can choose to share it or keep it private. However, it's important to be prepared for the possibility of discovering unexpected information about your family history. It could be something positive, negative, or simply surprising. I can help you interpret the results and connect you with resources if you need support. Would you like me to print out the brochures for those companies, and you can take some time to review them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Brochures would be helpful. And thank you, Doctor. You make me feel much better. I was getting scared. It’s just… I don’t want any trouble. I just want to know where my family came from, long ago. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly natural to feel apprehensive about something new, and I’m happy I could alleviate some of your concerns. I completely understand your desire to learn about your family history, and I’m here to help you through the process. Here are the brochures for 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage DNA. Take your time reviewing them, and feel free to ask me any questions you may have. We can discuss the costs, privacy policies, and features of each company, and decide which one is the best fit for your needs. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you so much, Doctor Stilaire. You been very kind. I’ll read these over and… maybe come back next week to talk about it?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. That sounds like a wonderful plan. Please, feel free to schedule an appointment for next week at your convenience. We can discuss the companies in more detail and decide which one is the best fit for you. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie. And please take care of yourself.
