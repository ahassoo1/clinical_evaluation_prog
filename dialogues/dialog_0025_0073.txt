DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long, and my regular doctor just keeps giving me pills that don’t do anything. It's… well, it's just the runs. Non-stop. And it’s embarrassing to even talk about, frankly.
DOCTOR: “The runs,” alright. And how long has this been… ongoing, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… probably about three months ago, maybe a little longer. At first, I thought it was just something I ate. You know, bad seafood or something. But it hasn’t stopped. It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking. And it’s gotten worse lately, even with the medicine. It's ruining my life, really. I can barely leave the house.
DOCTOR: Three months, consistently. And the medication your regular doctor prescribed… what was the name of it, if you recall?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. I'm terrible with names. Let me see... it was a little white pill. No, a beige pill! I think it started with an 'I'... or maybe a 'L'? Honestly, they just keep changing them and I don’t bother to write them down. They don't work, so what's the point? It was supposed to, you know, settle things down, but it didn’t. It just made me a little sleepy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. A beige pill, starting with an 'I' or 'L,' for…diarrhea. And it didn’t provide any relief, and caused some drowsiness. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Everything makes it worse! But… okay, if I had to pick, dairy definitely sets it off. And anything spicy. And coffee. So, basically, all the good things in life. Though, honestly, even water sometimes seems to trigger it. It's ridiculous, really. It's like my stomach hates me.
DOCTOR: So, dairy, spicy foods, coffee, and even water can exacerbate the issue. Have you had any changes in your diet recently, other than trying to avoid these triggers?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not really. I eat pretty much the same stuff I always have. Salmon, rice, berries… Tlingit food. I try to stay healthy, you know? But this… this is beyond just something I ate. I'm starting to think it's something serious, and I’m frankly annoyed my regular doctor hasn't taken me seriously. She just keeps telling me it’s probably a bug. Honestly, I’ve had bugs before. This is different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. You’ve been experiencing this for three months, despite attempts to manage it, and a medication that hasn’t been effective. You maintain a relatively consistent diet. And you’re understandably concerned given the duration and lack of improvement. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we’ll talk about some tests we can run to get a better idea of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it gets me somewhere. I’ve wasted enough time already. Just… please be quick about it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. And, if you don’t mind, I'll need to palpate your abdomen as well. It may be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be gentle. Now, just breathe normally… in and out. I'm listening for bowel sounds. They seem…hyperactive. And now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes, actually. It’s… tender all over, if I’m honest. But especially… here, on the left side. And lower down. It kind of hurts when you push there. Not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And it feels… bloated. Really bloated. Like I’m going to burst. Which, considering what’s been happening, is just lovely.
DOCTOR: Tenderness throughout, with increased sensitivity in the left lower quadrant. Palpable bloating. Alright. And, just to rule things out, I'm going to check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Reflexes are normal. Heart and lungs sound clear. Ms. Woodring, given the duration of your symptoms, the lack of response to treatment, and the findings on the physical exam, I think we need to run some tests. I’d like to order a stool culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. We should also check for C. difficile, just to be sure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More tests. Wonderful. Just… please hurry. And explain what all those things are. I don’t want a list of medical words I don’t understand. I just want this fixed. Are these… blood tests? And what even is a stool culture? It sounds awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, a metabolic panel and a complete blood count are blood tests. The metabolic panel checks your electrolyte balance and kidney function. The complete blood count looks at your red and white blood cell counts – it can help us see if there's any inflammation or infection. As for the stool culture, it’s…exactly what it sounds like. We’ll need a small sample of your stool to see if there are any bacteria causing the problem. It’s not pleasant, but it’s a necessary step to get a diagnosis. It's important to rule out infections and malabsorption issues, Ms. Woodring. I'm going to give you the requisition forms for the lab. Please go there as soon as you can. And, while we are waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding dairy and spicy foods altogether, as you’ve already identified those as triggers. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once we get the results back, to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: So, I have to go give them… that. Just great. And avoid the good things in life. Of course. Look, is this… serious? Are you thinking it's something really bad? Because frankly, that’s what it sounds like. My grandmother always said… never mind. Just tell me if I need to worry. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your concern. It's good that you are advocating for yourself, and being mindful of your family history. While I don’t want to alarm you, the persistence of your symptoms does warrant investigation. It could be several things – an infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or even a malabsorption issue like lactose intolerance. The tests we are ordering will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of treatment. It is unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, but it is important to address this and rule out any serious underlying conditions. We'll have a clearer picture once the lab results are back. Until then, I recommend staying hydrated and, as we discussed, avoiding your known triggers. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. I just… get this over with. I have a life, you know? I don’t have time to be running tests and feeling miserable. Just… hurry. And I expect a phone call with results, not another appointment. Do you understand? I can't keep taking time off work.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, I understand. We will contact you as soon as the lab results are available, and discuss them over the phone. Here are the requisitions, and the instructions for the stool sample. I expect these results within a few days, and you can expect a call with our findings and to proceed with the next step. I will need you to sign this release form to allow me to discuss the results with your insurance provider.
