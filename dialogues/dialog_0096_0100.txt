DOCTOR: Right then, Ms. Hughston. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um… well, it’s this drug test, I think? They said I needed one. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about work, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A drug test, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. For work. I operate… big machines, you know? Paving and such. They probably want to make sure I'm… safe. Is that it? I don't really recall all the details. It was a form, I think. Lots of boxes to tick.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless of the specifics, you’re here now, and we'll get it done. Before we proceed, just to be clear, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I think just some things for my arthritis. You know, the usual aches and pains for someone my age. Nothing fancy, I don’t really remember the names. I get them from the pharmacy, automatically, every month or so. Do you need the exact names? I could probably ask my daughter, she keeps track of all that.
DOCTOR: We do need to know what you’re taking, Ms. Hughston. Certain medications can interfere with the test results, or indicate other underlying issues. It’s important. Your daughter would be helpful, yes. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm… Not that I know of, really. I used to be a bit sniffly around cats when I was little, but that was ages ago. I don't have any pets now. I don’t think I've ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything. It’s another one of those things my memory just…doesn’t hold onto. Is that alright? Do you need a list from someone?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, while I appreciate you trying to recall, we need accurate information for your health and the validity of this test. It's not about needing a list, it's about being thorough. Do you recall any past medical conditions—anything you've been treated for, even years ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Past medical conditions… That's… a long time ago. I had my gallbladder out, I think. And… arthritis, obviously, that’s why I'm always creaky. And… my husband, he… he was sick for a long time before he passed. But that was… well, a while ago now. I don’t really remember much beyond that. I’m sorry. It’s just… everything feels so distant. Is this making things difficult?
DOCTOR: It does make it…challenging, Ms. Hughston. Right. Let’s move on. Have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries... Let me think... I don't think so. Just the gallbladder, as far as I recall. I had a lot of dental work done over the years, of course, fillings and such, but that doesn't count, does it? It’s so hard to remember everything clearly. I’m really sorry if this is slow going. Is it okay if I called my daughter later, to fill in the gaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, it would be helpful to speak with your daughter. But let's finish with family history first. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, no, they’re both gone now. My mother passed away a long time ago, and my father… well, he went a few years after that. I was the youngest of five, so… it’s been a while since I had much family around. I don’t really remember any major illnesses they had, to be honest. We weren’t very close, not really. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s…noted. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Definitely not! I never really cared for smoking, and alcohol gives me a terrible headache. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I’m a perfectly respectable woman. I just…operate big machines, that’s all. That's a bit stressful enough, thank you very much. Do you think I look like the type who would…?
DOCTOR: I am simply gathering information, Ms. Hughston. It is my job. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. After my husband passed, I’ve been on my own. It’s… quiet, sometimes. But I keep busy. I have my garden, and I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week. And my daughter comes to visit when she can. She lives a bit of a ways away, so it's not as often as I’d like. It’s… comfortable, you know? Simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. We’ve covered a lot… or attempted to. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure. Can you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam, yes. Of course. I’m not very good with heights, you know. Or… well, not heights exactly, but… never mind. Is this scale accurate? It feels a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. And your height is listed as one point nine seven meters. That is…rather tall for a woman. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Oh, is it? Yes, I suppose I am. I always have been. Is something wrong? I feel a bit… self-conscious now. My heart feels a bit fluttery, actually. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, Ms. Hughston, but likely due to anxiety. Breath sounds are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A bit high, but not alarmingly so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My joints ache sometimes, you know. It’s the arthritis. Ooh! That tickles! Are you sure everything is alright? I’m not very good with… medical things. It all feels a bit…invasive, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Right. The reflexes are… present, albeit a little diminished. Given your history of arthritis, that's not entirely unexpected. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My stomach doesn’t bother me much, usually. Just a bit gassy sometimes, if I eat the wrong things. Ooh, that’s a bit tender there, actually. Near my… belly button, I think. Is something wrong? I had a bit of trouble with indigestion last week, but I thought it was just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s a bit of tenderness there, as you say. It’s difficult to assess properly without a more detailed history. Given your age and lack of clarity regarding past medical conditions, I'm going to order some routine blood work. And a urine sample. This will help rule out any underlying infection or other issues. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood work, yes. That sounds sensible. I'm glad you're being thorough. I do worry sometimes, you know? About… forgetting things. And not knowing what's going on. A urine sample, yes. Of course. Where do I… do that? And… about the drug test? Is that still happening? I just… want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, the drug test will proceed after we collect the urine sample. The lab is just down the hall. I'll give you a cup and instructions. As for your worries… well, that’s what I’m here for. We'll get to the bottom of things. Now, I'm also going to write you a prescription for a mild anti-gas medication, just in case. Please follow the instructions carefully. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, let’s get that urine sample.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you. I do appreciate that. And… about my daughter? Should I call her now, to fill in the gaps? Or should I wait until after the blood work? I just… want to be helpful. And make sure everything is alright. It's just… everything feels a bit blurry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Let’s focus on getting the urine sample and blood work done first, Ms. Hughston. Then you can call your daughter. It's best to have a clearer picture before you start recalling things. The more accurate the information, the better. Now, please go to the lab and let them know I sent you. The nurse will guide you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Right. The lab, then. And… call my daughter later. Thank you. I think. .
