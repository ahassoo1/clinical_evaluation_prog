DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, so you’re here today… tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Sink. Yes, well, I am here because I am considering a move to one of those… senior living places. A nice young woman suggested I get a check-up first, to be sure I am fit enough. It’s a bit daunting, you see. A big change. But I want to be prepared, and do things properly.
DOCTOR: A pre-placement physical, right. Sensible. Alright. Let’s get a history. Now, do you have any… significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant problems… hmm. Let me think. I had a touch of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe sixty years ago. Recovered right as rain, though. My knees ache a bit when the weather turns, like most folks my age, I suppose. And my eyesight isn’t what it once was, which you can likely see. But nothing…serious, I wouldn’t say. I've always been a strong man, worked hard my whole life baking. Never much trouble with illness, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pneumonia… decades ago. We’ll note that. And the knee pain – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly with the cold, damp weather. Or if I've been on my feet too long, doing the baking. A good rest usually sorts it out. It’s not…debilitating, if that makes sense. Just a nuisance, really. I can still get around, mind you. Still bake every day, though not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery… no, Doctor, I haven't. Never needed any, thankfully. I broke my arm as a boy, climbing a tree – a foolish thing, looking back – but it healed up on its own, with a good splint and my mother’s care. No hospital visits for me, beyond that little scrape. I try to avoid doctors when I can, if you don't mind my saying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. And family history – are there any conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother lived to a good age, ninety-two, but she had… what was it called? Not diabetes, but something like it, with the sugar. She managed it with her diet, mostly. My father was strong as an oak, lived a long, healthy life, but I don’t recall him ever being ill. His brother had trouble with his heart when he got older, but that was about it. A strong family, mostly. We didn't talk about illness much, if I'm honest. Just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll note the potential history of diabetes in your mother. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Haven't taken a pill in my life, if you can believe it. Just a little willow bark tea now and then for aches, but that’s more of an old custom than a medicine, really. My mother always said fresh air and hard work were the best medicine, and I’ve always tried to live by that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, and never had a bit of trouble. I've seen folks with bad reactions, of course, but I've always been fortunate. Perhaps a slight itch if I get bitten by a mosquito, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. Let's move on. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. I can stand. Though, if you don’t mind me saying, all these questions are making me feel a bit like a young boy again, being examined by the school nurse! But I'm happy to cooperate, of course. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. Breathe deeply... and again... Hmm. A slight murmur, but not concerning for your age. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As you wish. A murmur, you say? I haven't ever been told that before. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but again, common for your age. Pulse is regular. Now, let me check your reflexes… Good. All present. And can you tell me if you have any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not beyond what you can see. It’s blurry up close, mostly. I need my glasses for reading and fine work, of course. I can see alright at a distance, though not as sharply as I used to. Things seem a bit… dim, sometimes. It's just age, I suppose. I’ve gotten used to it. Is my vision concerning?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll note the vision changes. It appears you have some age-related macular degeneration. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out anything else. Have a seat and I'll explain everything.
PATIENT: Macular degeneration… hmm. That sounds serious. Is that why my vision is getting worse? Will it… will it make me blind? I rely on my sight for my baking, you see. It would be…difficult. Please explain, Doctor. I am a simple man and I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: It’s common as you get older, Mr. Tkac. It won't cause complete blindness, but it can affect your central vision. We need to monitor it. The blood work is just to rule out anything else contributing to vision changes. I'll also refer you to an ophthalmologist. They are specialists. They can give you a definitive diagnosis and discuss treatment options. It’s best to get it checked out thoroughly, as soon as possible. Don’t worry too much just yet. We are just being thorough.
PATIENT: I see. An ophthalmologist… right. Treatment options… what sort of treatment? Will I need surgery? I suppose I knew my sight wasn’t what it once was, but… to think of needing a specialist… it’s a bit daunting. Will this affect my ability to… live independently, do you think? That’s what concerns me most, you see. Being a burden on others. It's all happening so quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely you'll need surgery, Mr. Tkac. Treatment options typically involve injections or laser therapy, but we need to get a proper assessment first. As for independence, that depends on how quickly the condition progresses. We’ll monitor it closely, and there are aids available to help with vision impairment. I am writing a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a specialist. They’ll give you a thorough examination and discuss all your options. This way, we have a more definite path forward, and can explore the best solution. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. You mentioned the blood work. What exactly are you looking for? And will it be a painful process? I’ve always been a bit… sensitive to needles, if I’m honest. And…if my vision does worsen, what sort of aids are available? Could I still…bake? That’s all I’ve ever known. This senior living facility…would they accommodate someone with limited vision? It seems so much is up in the air, and it’s quite overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The blood work is routine, Mr. Tkac. We're checking for diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and other factors that can affect vision. It’s a simple blood draw, a little pinch, really. It shouldn't be too painful, but if you're anxious, let the phlebotomist know. As for aids, there are magnifiers, large-print books, and assistive technology available. And yes, you can still bake. There are tools designed for people with limited vision. And most senior living facilities are accommodating. They’ll have staff available to assist you, and can adapt activities to your needs. I am going to print out your referral order and a list of resources for low vision. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your blood work and the ophthalmologist’s assessment. Do you have any further concerns at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds…reassuring, Doctor, thank you. A list of resources… that’s very kind. I believe that will help ease my mind somewhat. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Just…the uncertainty is a bit overwhelming, as you can imagine. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for not dismissing my concerns. I feel…a little better prepared now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get that blood work done as soon as possible, and schedule that appointment with Dr. Carter. We’ll see you at your follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac.
