DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… a “check-up”? It’s all rather unnecessary, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes those check-ups are a bit… insistent! No worries, we can definitely keep things brief. But even when feeling well, it's good to get a baseline, just in case. Just to be thorough. So, “perfectly fine” is good to hear. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, you doctors and your “thoroughness”. Honestly. Well, I manage. I haven’t had any… troubles, if that’s what you’re after. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Though I maintain excellent posture, you know. Always have. It’s a Maya thing. And I haven't been sick in… well, a very long time. Truly. I can't recall the last time. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That is good to hear, Candice. Excellent posture is wonderful – I commend you on that! And not being sick for a long time is fantastic. Just to be a bit more specific, when you say "aches and pains," where are you feeling those most?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. It’s… everywhere, really. A little in my back, perhaps. And my knees sometimes creak when I stand up. Though, frankly, I don’t stand up much these days. It’s a waste of energy. And… oh, my hands. They get a bit stiff in the mornings. But it’s nothing to write home about. Really. It's just…old age! Are we done yet? This chair isn't terribly comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've got a bit of general wear and tear, which is very common. We definitely want to get a better picture of things though, so we can see if there is anything we need to address. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking about history? I’m seventy-nine years old, doctor! My history is rather extensive. I haven’t the slightest idea. I saw a doctor… when I was much younger, of course. For the usual things. Perhaps a cold once or twice. But diagnosed with anything? No, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been very healthy. My husband handles all those… papers. He’d know if I had anything. Truly, I do not recall. Can we please move on? This is all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. No problem at all. We can definitely move on. Since you mentioned your husband handles the paperwork, perhaps we can get some information from his records if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Heavens, no. I wouldn't dream of letting anyone cut me open unless it was absolutely necessary. And it hasn’t been, thankfully. A woman must protect her… integrity. I’ve always been very careful. No, absolutely no surgeries. I have a very strong constitution, you see. Though, I did have my tonsils out as a child, a very long time ago. But that was hardly a surgery, was it? A simple procedure. Honestly, are you writing all this down? It's quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. It's important to have a complete picture, Candice, even the "simple" procedures. Tonsils out as a child is good to know. Now, thinking about your family – have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… Oh dear. That's… complicated. My mother… she lived to a very old age, I believe. But I don’t recall any particular ailments. She was… a strong woman. My father… he traveled a great deal. I don’t know much about his health, to be honest. He wasn't around much. As for siblings… I had a sister, but she moved away when we were young. We didn’t keep in touch. Honestly, it’s all a bit hazy. I don’t believe anyone suffered from anything… significant. Are we nearly done? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. It’s common to not have all the details, especially when family members are distant or passed away. Let's talk a little about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no! I wouldn't dream of filling my body with all those… chemicals. I believe in natural remedies, you see. A little rest, a good diet, and positive thinking. That’s all one needs. Vitamins… perhaps I take a multivitamin occasionally. But nothing regular. And allergies? No, I’m not allergic to anything. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat. Honestly, doctor, this is all rather… insulting. Are you suggesting I’m unhealthy? I assure you, I am not. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: I assure you, Candice, I am not suggesting anything of the sort. It's just standard procedure to ask about these things. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you're willing, just to get a baseline. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
