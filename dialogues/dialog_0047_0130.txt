DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well… my sister, she got… something bad. Cancer, they said. And my mother… she had something, a long time ago. I don't remember exactly what, but it was bad too. I just… want to make sure I'm okay. You know? I don’t want… trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be proactive, especially with a family history. We can certainly discuss that. Just to clarify, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms yourself at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Nothing feels… wrong. That's why I’m here, I think. Before something does feel wrong. I feel… fine. But my wife, before she… well, she always said I should get checked. She was always right about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. A sensible woman, your wife. So, preventative care, then. Excellent. Let's get a thorough history then, just to have a baseline. First, could you tell me a bit more about your mother’s illness?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time ago. I was just a boy. I remember… hospitals. And her being… tired. Very tired. They said it was… something with her insides. Stomach, maybe? Or… something else? I don't remember the name. It was before your time, I’m sure. And she… she didn't live very long after. Not long at all. I wish I paid more attention then. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s often difficult to recall details from childhood. “Something with her insides”... that’s not terribly specific, unfortunately. Do you know if she had any surgeries or treatments?
PATIENT: Surgeries… maybe? I think so. They cut her open, I remember that. And… she got pills. Lots of pills. And she was in the hospital a long, long time. That’s all I really know. My dad… he didn’t talk about it much. He just… worried a lot. I didn't ask questions. Didn't want to upset him. It was a sad time. Really sad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your sister’s cancer – do you know what type it is?
PATIENT: She… it's in her chest. Doctor said… lung cancer. They found it… late. She’s getting… things. Shots and… something with a machine. She's very brave, my sister. But… she looks tired too. Very tired, like my mother. That's why I’m so worried. They said it's… not always passed down, but… I don’t understand what that means. Does that mean I could get it?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schwer, it’s good you’re being proactive. Lung cancer can have a genetic component, but it’s often linked to environmental factors – smoking, exposure to certain chemicals. Just having a family member with it doesn't guarantee you'll develop it. However, given your family history, we should certainly proceed with some baseline testing. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even tried it. Always thought it was a bad habit. My wife… she hated it. Said it smelled awful. And my sister… she tried it when she was young, but she quit. A long time ago, before… all this. I always stayed away from it. Clean living, that's what I always did. Mostly. I liked a beer sometimes, with dinner. But never smoked.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you drink alcohol regularly, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Just a couple of beers a week. Maybe three, on a weekend. With food. I don’t drink alone. And I don’t… you know… get drunk. Just relax, that’s all. It’s not… a problem. My wife always said a little beer was good for the heart. She liked a glass of wine with dinner herself. But not too much. She was always sensible.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. Alright. And outside of that, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. A little stiff in the mornings, but that’s just getting old. And my eyesight’s not what it used to be, that's why I wear glasses. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no… nothing. I used to work hard, traveling a lot for my job. That kept me fit. Sales work, always on the go. But now… I mostly just take it easy. Read the paper, watch a little TV. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just… some pills for my water. The doctor said my kidneys weren’t working as good as they should. Something about old age again. Little white pills. I take them every morning. And… that’s it. Really. Just those little white pills. I don't like taking pills, but the doctor said I needed them. He's a good doctor, I think. But he's very busy. Doesn’t have much time to talk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. My wife… she was the one with the allergies. Dust, pollen, cats… all sorts of things. I was always fine. She had to carry around that… that spray for her nose. But me? Never. Just… never had any problems. I'm a pretty simple man, I think. Don't need much to be happy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Schwer, given your family history and your age, I think it’s prudent to order some baseline blood work. We'll check your kidney function, liver function, and do a complete blood count. And I’d also like to schedule a chest X-ray. Just to get a clear picture of your lungs. It’s routine, but important. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to… make sure. Make sure I’m okay. And… make my wife proud. She always worried about me. She would want me to do this. Blood work and… a picture of my lungs. Yes, that sounds good. When can we do it? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the blood work won’t hurt a bit. Just a small prick of the needle. The X-ray is completely painless as well. We can get the blood work done today, in the lab just down the hall. The X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The lab technician will explain everything to you. It’s all very straightforward. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Today for the blood… and tomorrow for the picture. Okay. That sounds… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time. My wife… she would be very pleased.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She will give you instructions for fasting beforehand, if any are needed. And remember, try not to worry. These are just routine precautions.
