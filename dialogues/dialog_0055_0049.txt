DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Hmm… what did bring me in… now that’s a good question. It’s me ears, I think. They ain't what they used to be, that’s for sure. Folks are always mumblin’, or maybe I'm just gettin’ old! It's hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty hearing, you say. And you're not certain if it's a change in your hearing or simply others being less clear?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. It’s a bit of both, I reckon. Sometimes I can hear fine, clear as a bell. Then other times… well, it's like talkin’ underwater, ya know? Especially when there’s a bit of noise around. It's been goin’ on for… oh, goodness, I couldn't rightly say how long. A while, that’s for sure. Longer than a few weeks, at least.
DOCTOR: “A while.” Very descriptive, Mr. Schneer. We'll need to be a bit more precise to determine the cause. Has this been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, gradual, I think. Not like a bang, or somethin'. Just… faded, little by little. Like an old photograph, maybe? I don’t remember a specific moment it started, just… noticed I was askin’ folks to repeat themselves more and more. It’s a bit hazy, if you don’t mind me sayin’. Old age, ya know? Things get… blurry.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Bluriness is… common. Now, has this hearing difficulty been worse in one ear versus the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that’s a good question. I… I honestly couldn’t tell ya. I don’t really pay attention to which ear it is, just that it’s hard to hear! Maybe the left one? No… or was it the right? Oh dear, I’m terrible at rememberin’ things like that. They both seem pretty bad, if I'm bein' honest. I wouldn’t know where to start to tell the difference.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any ringing in your ears, or any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Ringing… now, there is a bit of a… hum sometimes. Not a loud ringin’, more like a… a quiet whistle. It comes and goes, mostly when it's quiet. And no, no pain or discomfort, thankfully. Just… hard to hear. That’s all. Least I ain’t in pain!
DOCTOR: A quiet hum, intermittent. Good to know. Now, Mr. Schneer, I'm going to perform a brief hearing examination. It won’t be terribly invasive, just a few simple tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds fine, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t involve stickin’ anything in me ears! I’m a bit squeamish, ya see. But a few simple tests, that’s alright. Go right ahead. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: Of course, nothing will be inserted. We will simply be using headphones to play some tones at different volumes. I’ll ask you to indicate when you hear them. It’s quite straightforward. Now, if you would please sit facing this way…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Headphones, that's fine. Sounds simple enough. Old bones creak, ya know. Give me a moment to get situated… There we go. Ready when you are, Doctor. Just don’t be too loud, alright?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I am going to play a series of tones in each ear. Please raise your hand when you hear a sound, no matter how faint. We'll start with the right ear. Okay, Mr. Schneer, let me know when you hear something… Nothing yet?
PATIENT: Nothin' yet, Doctor. Just… silence. Wait… is that a… faint hum? No, maybe not. Still nothin'. I'm listenin' real hard, I promise. It's just… quiet. Real quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the left ear. Let me know when you hear anything at all… Anything, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Hmmm… now… wait a minute. I think… yes! I heard somethin'! Very faint, but I heard it. Like a little whisper. Is that right? I don't want to give ya a false alarm. It was real quiet, Doctor. Real quiet.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite alright. You didn't give me a false alarm. We are simply documenting the softest sounds you can perceive. Now, I will now perform a speech audiometry test. I will say a few words at a comfortable volume, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, speech, alright. Repeat words, that sounds simple enough. Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll do me best. Me memory ain't what it used to be, mind you, but I'll give it a try.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, I’m going to say a few words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. "Ball."
PATIENT: ...Ball? B… uh… hall? No… Wall? Oh dear. Is it… fall? I’m terrible at this, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: That is quite alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s simply an assessment. "Cat."
PATIENT: Cat… … hat? No… bat? Oh, this is awful. I know that word… it's on the tip of me tongue… I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on the examination, it appears you have a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, with difficulty understanding speech, particularly at lower volumes. This is a common finding in individuals of your age. Now, we can discuss potential options, such as hearing aids. However, I must warn you, they are not a cure-all, and require adjustment and practice. Alternatively, we could refer you to an audiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and fitting. Would you prefer I schedule an appointment with an audiologist?
PATIENT: Oh… hearing aids, ya say? Well, I don’t know about them fancy things… I always thought me ears were just gettin’ old. An audiologist, ya say? Is that someone who… fixes ears? If they can help, then… yes. Yes, please. Schedule me an appointment with them. I’d like that. If it's not too much trouble. I just want to be able to hear me grandkids, ya know?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will schedule you an appointment with Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected audiologist in the area. She has an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Will that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… at two? … Yes, that should be alright. As long as I can remember… …Yes, Tuesday at two is fine. Just… remind me, will ya? Me memory isn’t what it used to be. I appreciate that, Doctor. Thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is the referral slip with Dr. Reed’s contact information and appointment details. A member of my staff will also call you tomorrow to confirm. Now, do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very thoughtful of ya. No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you for listenin’ to me. And for not laughin’ at me when I couldn’t hear the words. You’ve been very kind. I’ll see ya around, I reckon. .
