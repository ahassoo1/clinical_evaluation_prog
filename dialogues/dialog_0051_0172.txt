DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It’s just… a formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires these visits. Something about… getting established. I haven’t the faintest idea what they expect me to tell you. It’s all rather silly, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, even if it feels like a formality, it’s a good opportunity to get a baseline of your health, and make sure everything is as it should be. And it is important to establish care when you move to a new area. Perhaps we can start with just a general overview. Are you experiencing any specific health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: Problems? At my age? What isn't a problem? Aches and pains, naturally. Though I refuse to complain. It’s simply… living. I suppose my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but that’s hardly a medical emergency. And I get… winded easily. Walking up stairs is quite the ordeal, I'll admit. But that’s probably just… laziness. People expect too much these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've got a good perspective on things. However, even things that feel “normal” for your age can be worth looking into, just to make sure everything is functioning as well as it could be. You mentioned aches and pains, and getting winded easily. Can you tell me a little more about the aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must we delve into such unpleasantness? Very well. It’s mostly in my joints, I suppose. Knees, hips… wrists, sometimes. It flares up with the weather, naturally. Dampness is dreadful. And it's just… a general stiffness. I wouldn’t expect you to do anything about it. I’ve managed for seventy-nine years, I hardly need a doctor to tell me how to live with a little discomfort. Is this going to take long? My bridge club meeting starts at two.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, and I’ll certainly be mindful of that. It sounds like you've been coping well with these symptoms for a while. Just to get a better picture, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: A… scale? Honestly. What a vulgar concept. Pain isn't a number, Doctor. It's… unpleasant. On a bad day, perhaps a… six? Though I resent quantifying it. It implies weakness. And frankly, I don’t have time for such frivolous measurements. Can we please move on? I’d like to discuss my prescription renewals, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can certainly discuss your prescriptions. Before we get to that though, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to it. I suppose my husband mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little… elevated. Though I felt perfectly fine at the time. He’s always fussing over something. And I think my mother had some sort of… sugar problem. Diabetes, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and frankly, I wasn't paying much attention. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a busy woman. Do you really need to know all of this? I'm perfectly capable of managing my own affairs.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's not about questioning your ability to manage, it's about making sure we have all the pieces of the puzzle. Knowing about a family history of diabetes, and your husband mentioning elevated blood pressure, is helpful. Do you currently take any medications, besides what you may be getting renewed today?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, there’s the little white pill for my water retention. Husband insists. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a half of his sleeping tablet. Don’t tell him I said that! It’s just occasionally, you understand. And… oh, yes. I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But I can’t for the life of me remember the name. It's a small, yellow one, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I have a perfectly good memory for bridge hands, but these pills… they all blur together. Is this going to be over soon? My patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. We can try to look up those medications later. Don’t worry about it. Now, just a few questions about your past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think. There was… something when I was a girl. My appendix, I believe. A very long time ago. And… later, when I broke my wrist. Though it wasn’t a proper surgery, more of a… setting, I suppose. And… oh, yes. A hysterectomy. Decades ago. A rather unpleasant experience, if I recall correctly. Honestly, Doctor, it was all so long ago. Do you really need a complete medical history? I feel as though I’m being interrogated. Perhaps I should just cancel this appointment.
DOCTOR: No, no interrogation intended, Candice. I apologize if it feels that way. It’s simply important to have a full picture, especially with a new patient. Okay, so appendix, wrist setting, and hysterectomy. Thank you. Now, just one more question about your past medical history. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I eat everything. Everything! And I enjoy gardening, you know. Pollen is simply part of life. Though sometimes my nose gets a little itchy. Husband gives me something for that. A little pink pill, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy woman. All this questioning is quite unnecessary. I’d really like to discuss my prescriptions now, if that’s possible. I need to refill my blood pressure medication and… oh, yes. The little white pills for my ankles. And perhaps something for my sleep, if you have anything stronger. This is taking far too long. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand your frustration and desire to get to your prescriptions. We can certainly do that now. Before we proceed, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright. It’s a standard part of a new patient visit, and it will help me ensure I’m prescribing the most appropriate medications for you. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
