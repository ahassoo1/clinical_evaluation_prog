DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. It’s just… a lot. More than it used to be, you understand. Not a lot a lot, but… frequent. Yes, frequent is the word. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps telling me to come in. Says I'm interrupting her stories on the television. Honestly, sometimes I don’t even need to go, you know? Just… feel like I do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination, and sometimes feeling the urge even when you don’t necessarily need to go – that can certainly be disruptive. And it's good of your wife to encourage you to seek medical attention. It’s always best to investigate changes in your body. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, investigation… yes. Important, I suppose. Though, truthfully, I don’t see what’s to investigate. I’m an old man. Old men go to the bathroom, don't they? It’s natural. But… alright. Let me see. It’s mostly at night, I think. Wakes me up a couple times. And… well, sometimes during the day too. But not every time I stand up, or anything. Not like that. Just… randomly. And it's not painful, mind you. Just… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Segretto. So, it's primarily at night, waking you from sleep, but also occurs during the day, and it’s not consistently linked to standing up. And importantly, you haven’t experienced any pain associated with it. Now, when you say “a couple of times” at night, roughly how many times are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers... always with the numbers. Let me think. It’s not every night, thankfully. Maybe… two, three times a week? Some weeks more, some weeks less. It's hard to keep track, you know? I'm not a meticulous man. My wife, again, she keeps a calendar for everything. But as for me... it's a blur. Let’s just say enough to bother me. And enough to bother her television viewing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. A couple of times a week is a good starting point. It sounds like this has been a gradual change, and it's understandably impacting your sleep and daily life. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream – such as difficulty starting, weakness, or a feeling like you're not emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Urine stream… Oh dear. Now you’re asking about… details. Well, let me see… no, no weakness, not that I’ve noticed. It comes out… you know, like it should. Not a strong stream, perhaps. But I'm an old man! Things aren’t as… robust as they used to be. Emptying… I think so. It feels like I do. But honestly, how would I know if I emptied it completely? It just… stops. Does that make sense? I don’t sit there and measure it, you understand. It’s just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. It’s good you’re able to describe it so clearly. A normal, but perhaps not as forceful stream, and feeling like you empty your bladder, but without a way to be certain. Now, have you noticed any increase in your thirst, or have you been drinking more fluids than usual?
PATIENT: Thirst? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe. I do enjoy a glass of water with my meals, and perhaps I’ve been having an extra one here and there. But I live on the farm, you know? It gets hot. Always hot in the summer. I’m always thirsty when I'm working outside. So, it's not necessarily more than usual, I wouldn't say. Just… normal for a farmer in August.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Segretto. So, increased fluid intake, but possibly related to the warmer weather and your work on the farm. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a long story. Let me see… My wife keeps all the papers, bless her heart. I see doctors now and then, for check-ups, you know. The usual old man stuff. My blood pressure, I think, sometimes gets a little high. Nothing they can’t handle with a little pill, though. Diabetes… no, never been told that. Heart problems… not that I know of. I’ve always been a strong man, worked hard all my life. Though, I did have a touch of… something… in my knee a few years back, but that’s all long gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, with some occasional high blood pressure managed with medication. No history of diabetes or heart problems, and a previous knee issue that has resolved. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. Well, there was that time I fell off the roof fixing the barn, many years ago. Broke my arm, I believe. Had to go to the hospital for that, got it set and all. That was… oh, goodness, must have been 40 years ago? Maybe more. And… let me see… nothing else comes to mind. Just the arm. Nothing serious. A farm boy’s mishap, you understand. Always something happening on a farm.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. A broken arm many years ago after a fall. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father, he had… something with his heart, I think. Died young, poor man. And my mother, she had trouble with her… her memory, towards the end. Just… forgetting things. Like me, perhaps. But I wouldn’t worry too much about that. Just old age, you understand. Things happen. Not much you can do about it. And my wife, bless her heart, she’s as healthy as a horse. Always has been. Strong woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems in your father, and memory issues in your mother. And your wife is in good health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, just the one for the blood pressure. Little white pill. Take it every morning with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget, but my wife reminds me. She’s very good about that. And… let me see… no, nothing else. I don't like taking pills, you understand. They never sit well with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had one in my life. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. My wife makes a good beet soup, but I don’t care for that. But that’s not an allergy, you understand. Just a matter of taste. I’m a hearty man, I eat whatever comes my way. Never been one to shy away from anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Segretto. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Always good to make sure everything is still working, you know? Though, I'm not expecting any surprises. Old man stuff, you understand. Do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please follow me over to the examination table, we’ll get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate and rhythm sound regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your abdomen. No tenderness here. And I will check your prostate. Prostate feels slightly enlarged, but that’s not uncommon for men your age. Finally, I'll check your neurological reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but the slightly enlarged prostate could be contributing to your urinary symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That… that was quick. Enlarged prostate, you say? Is that… bad? My wife, bless her heart, she keeps telling me to drink less fluids before bed. Perhaps she’s right. I always thought it was just an old man’s complaint, you know? Everything shrinking and swelling.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Mr. Segretto. Prostate enlargement, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is very common as men age. It’s rarely a sign of anything serious. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body, and when it enlarges, it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting or stopping, and a feeling like you're not emptying your bladder completely – the symptoms you’ve been describing. Your wife is right to suggest limiting fluids before bed. That’s a good first step. We can also consider a few other options to help manage your symptoms. I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a PSA blood test to get a baseline reading for your prostate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Tests... always with the tests. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary, go ahead. Though, truthfully, I don’t see what good poking and prodding will do. I'm an old man, Doctor. These things happen. But if my wife thinks it's best… And she’s usually right. PSA... what was that again? Something about my… prostate?
DOCTOR: Yes, a PSA test stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen test. It's a blood test that measures the level of PSA in your blood. The prostate gland naturally produces PSA, and elevated levels can sometimes indicate prostate enlargement or other issues. It's just another piece of information to help us understand what’s going on and rule out anything more serious. It’s a simple blood draw, and it will give us a good baseline to monitor any changes over time. I'll also write you a prescription for tamsulosin, a medication that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve urine flow. It’s a commonly used medication for BPH. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. It's important to take it as directed, and be aware of potential side effects like dizziness or lightheadedness. I'd like to see you back in a month to review the lab results and see how you're doing on the medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. A medication... alright. More pills. My wife will be pleased. She always wants me to take something for everything. Dizziness... lightheadedness... hmm. I suppose I can handle a little dizziness. I’ve been through worse on that farm, you understand. A month... yes. A month sounds… alright. Just… try to keep it brief, Doctor. My wife has a lot of stories to tell, and I don't want to miss them. And make sure your nurse knows I need a large print copy of those instructions. My eyes aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I’ll make sure the nurse has a large print copy of the instructions, and we’ll keep the follow-up appointment as brief as possible. I understand your wife's stories are important, and we’ll respect your time. To recap, we've ordered a urine analysis and a PSA test, started you on a low dose of tamsulosin, and scheduled a follow-up appointment in one month to review the results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see... No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long next time. My wife… well, you know. Stories. And make sure that nurse really has those instructions in large print. I don't want to bother you with squinting and asking questions I should already know. Alright. I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'll make a note about the instructions, and we’ll do our best to keep your wait time minimal. If you experience any concerning side effects or any worsening of your symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and enjoy your time with your wife and her stories.
