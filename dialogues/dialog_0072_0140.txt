DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 41 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 41, precisely. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s be quick, shall we? It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. I have something… unpleasant in my mouth. A white coating. It’s not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Understandable. While I appreciate your directness, Mr. Schieber, a thorough assessment is necessary, even with…sensitive issues. It's important to understand the full scope of the problem. Could you describe this “white coating” in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Honestly, Doctor, it looks white. Like… milk, perhaps? It's on my tongue, mostly, and the insides of my cheeks. It’s…sticky. And it makes it difficult to eat. Really, is that not enough detail? I’m not a doctor, I don’t have a vocabulary for describing things in my mouth.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know where it is located, Mr. Schieber, but a precise description assists in determining the cause. Is it raised?
PATIENT: Raised? I… I suppose so. It’s not flat, if that’s what you mean. It’s like a film. A bumpy film, perhaps. Look, I assure you, I’ve been very careful with my hygiene. This isn’t from a lack of… cleanliness.
DOCTOR: Very well. Has this coating appeared suddenly, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t overnight, if that’s what you're asking. Perhaps… a week ago I noticed it was a little worse than usual. Though, to be honest, I don’t spend much time examining my mouth. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Schieber. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning sensation associated with this coating?
PATIENT: Pain, no. Not exactly. It’s more… irritating. And it makes swallowing difficult. It feels… rough. Like sandpaper, almost. It’s not a sharp pain, just… unpleasant. And frankly, it’s starting to affect my appetite.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills, certainly not. Weight loss… well, my wife says I’ve been a bit off my food lately, but that’s hardly a medical emergency, is it? I haven’t exactly been meticulously tracking my weight. It's probably just stress at work.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about any recent illnesses, or have you taken any new medications?
PATIENT: No illnesses, no. And medications… just the usual things. A pain reliever for my back occasionally. Nothing new. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Look, Doctor, is this going to take much longer? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, a proper examination is crucial, regardless of your schedule. I need to visually assess the condition in your mouth. Please open wide and stick out your tongue.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But be quick about it. Honestly, the indignity of it all. There. Happy?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There is a significant amount of white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. It appears somewhat patchy and, upon closer inspection… It is easily scraped off, leaving a slightly erythematous base. No obvious lesions or bleeding. It’s consistent with oral thrush, likely Candida albicans.
PATIENT: Thrush? What’s… thrush? Is it serious? And what causes it? I assure you, I maintain excellent oral hygiene. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Oral thrush, or oral candidiasis, is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida. It’s not necessarily indicative of poor hygiene, although it can be exacerbated by it. Often, it occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, or those taking certain medications, like inhaled corticosteroids or antibiotics. It can also be seen in patients with diabetes, or those with dry mouth. In your case, given your medical history – or lack thereof, frankly – it could simply be a localized overgrowth. We’ll need to rule out other possibilities, but for now, I’m recommending an antifungal mouthwash, Nystatin, to be used four times a day for two weeks.
PATIENT: Two weeks? That seems… excessive. And an antifungal? Is that…safe? I’m not keen on putting chemicals in my mouth. Look, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? Perhaps it will just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, while it’s true that some mild cases resolve on their own, the extent of the coating I observed warrants treatment. Leaving it untreated can lead to discomfort, difficulty eating, and, in rare cases, spread of the infection. Nystatin is a relatively safe medication with minimal side effects, primarily a mild, transient taste disturbance. I'm prescribing it now. It’s essential you complete the full two-week course, even if your symptoms improve before then. Additionally, I recommend improving your oral hygiene – gentle brushing twice daily, flossing, and staying adequately hydrated. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Hydrated… yes, yes, I drink water. Fine. Two weeks. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. And what if it doesn’t work? What then? And is there anything I need to avoid while using this… mouthwash? Certain foods, perhaps? This is a complete nuisance.
DOCTOR: If the Nystatin doesn't resolve the issue after two weeks, we will need to investigate further to rule out underlying causes, such as a weakened immune system or other contributing factors. That may involve blood work or referral to a specialist. As for dietary restrictions, avoid sugary foods and drinks, as these can exacerbate the fungal growth. Also, avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes and smoking, if applicable. This prescription is for Nystatin oral suspension, 500,000 units per 5ml. Swish 10ml four times daily after meals for 14 days. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Ten milliliters… four times a day… after meals… Yes, yes, I think so. After meals. No sugary foods. And no alcohol mouthwash. Very well. I understand. I sincerely hope this works, Doctor. I haven’t got time for a specialist. Thank you. I believe that’s all. Although I still maintain this is a complete overreaction.
DOCTOR: Very well. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after completing the course of treatment, please schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. And, Mr. Schieber, I strongly advise maintaining good oral hygiene habits. Have a good day.
