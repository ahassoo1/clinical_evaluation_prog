DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Keeps coming back. And with it, these water infections. Seems to be happening more often these days. The doctor back home, he said something about my kidneys… something about lots of little sacs? I don’t quite recall the full name, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Recurring pain in your side and frequent urinary tract infections. And your previous doctor mentioned something about your kidneys and small sacs… that sounds like he may have been referring to polycystic kidney disease, or PKD. We’ll need to look into that further. Let me pull up your records… Ah, yes. I see some previous UTIs documented. And no specific diagnosis of PKD, but there are notes about a family history of kidney problems. To start, can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Yes, family… my sister, she had trouble with her kidneys too. The pain… it’s hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, not really. More of a dull ache, mostly on my right side, lower down. Sometimes it goes around to my back a little. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it's quite uncomfortable. It doesn't really stop me from doing things, but it makes me feel… worn out, you know? And then, of course, the burning when I go to the toilet. That's the worst part, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on your right side, radiating to your back, and accompanied by burning with urination. That helps. And it doesn’t completely prevent you from your daily activities, but causes fatigue. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. A bit of aches and pains as you get older, of course. But nothing a good rest wouldn't fix. I do get a little breathless sometimes when I walk up hills, but I put that down to my age, mostly. The doctor used to listen to my chest and said it was just my lungs, nothing too serious. But no, no big diagnoses, no. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major diagnoses, just some age-related aches and pains and mild shortness of breath. And you are covered by Medicare, good to know. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. When they’re really acting up. It’s called glucosamine, I think? And I take a multivitamin, just to keep things topped up, you know? Nothing else, not regularly. If I get a headache, I’ll take a paracetamol, but that’s about it. Oh, and sometimes a little something for indigestion. But those are just as-needed things, not every day. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know, thank you. We need to consider everything. Glucosamine, a multivitamin, and occasional paracetamol and something for indigestion. Now, let’s talk about your family history a bit more. You mentioned your sister had kidney problems. Did anyone else in your family have kidney disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother, she had high blood pressure. She was on tablets for it, for many years. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. He lost a foot, poor man. It was a bad thing. And… Now that I think about it, my cousin, she was always tired. She went to the hospital a lot, but I don’t know what was wrong with her. Something with her water, maybe? It was a long time ago. I was just a young boy. It's hard to recall everything precisely. But there was definitely trouble with kidneys and blood pressure, on both sides of the family, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and potential kidney issues on both sides of the family. That's significant. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, as far as I can remember. Sometimes the paracetamol makes me a little sleepy, but that’s all. No serious allergies, no. Is that everything for now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Based on what you've told me about your symptoms – the recurring side pain, frequent UTIs, and your family history – I'd like to do a quick physical examination and then order some blood and urine tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical examination and some tests… yes, that’s fine. I trust your judgement. Let’s get it done, shall we? I just hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the examination. If you could lie down on the table, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Okay. I am noticing some tenderness in your right flank. Not severe, but it is definitely present. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I will need to collect a urine sample, and then draw some blood for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a kidney function test. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your kidneys. Do you have any trouble providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: No trouble at all, Doctor. I’ve been providing those for years, I’m afraid. It seems I’m always at the doctor's office these days. But no, no problems. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll do my best. What about the blood test? I don't like needles very much, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the urine sample. As for the blood test, I understand your apprehension. It's a quick pinch, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll minimize discomfort as much as possible. The restroom is just down the hall to collect your sample. And then, come back here, and we'll do the blood draw. I'll be right here when you're finished. Just take your time.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I’ll go and get that sample then. And try not to faint when the needle comes out!
DOCTOR:
