DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my face gets red. Really red. Like, a lot. It happens sometimes, and it’s… embarrassing. Mostly when I’m talking to people. It just comes on. Not always, you understand, just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Redness of the face… occurring intermittently, you say, and often when speaking with others. Alright. Can you describe exactly what it feels like when this happens?
PATIENT: Feels… warm, Doctor. Like a hot flash, but just on my face. Not my chest, not my neck, just… my cheeks and nose get really warm. And then red. Very red. It doesn't hurt, you know? It’s just… noticeable. People look. I can feel it. It happens quick, too. Not like it builds up slowly. Just… whoosh. There.
DOCTOR: "Whoosh," you say. An abrupt onset of warmth and redness, localized to the cheeks and nose. And it doesn’t cause any pain or discomfort, merely a visible flushing. How long does this redness typically last?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not long, Doctor. Maybe a few minutes? Five, ten minutes, sometimes. Then it goes away. Just… fades. It doesn’t happen every time I talk, you understand. Only… some people, some times. It’s… hard to say why. It’s not like I’m nervous, not always. Sometimes I’m just talking… about things. Normal things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a transient flushing of the face, lasting minutes, not consistently triggered by emotional state. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to bring it on?
PATIENT: That’s… tricky, Doctor. No, not really. I mean… sometimes if I have a little bit of tea? But not always. And not even strong tea. Sometimes it happens after I eat something spicy, but then other times I can eat very spicy food and nothing happens. It’s… I don’t know. It feels random, mostly. I wish I knew what caused it! Makes things a bit awkward, you see. Especially at the market. People stare.
DOCTOR: Market interactions… and you suspect a link to dietary factors, though inconsistent. Let’s move on to other areas. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing… serious. Just getting old, I suppose. A little bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but nothing a warm glass of milk doesn’t fix. And my knees get a bit creaky in the cold weather. But that’s about it, really. I don’t take any medicines, haven’t for years. My wife… well, she used to handle all that. But she… passed a few years back. So, it's just me now. I try to stay healthy, eat good food when I can.
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances and knee discomfort. No current medications. I see. And are there any allergies I should document?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife used to make a lovely curry, very spicy, lots of different things in it. Never bothered me a bit. I’ve never needed an EpiPen, or anything like that. I’m pretty good, really. Just this… face thing. It’s the only thing that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let's discuss your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. But that was a long time ago, in India. Lots of people have heart trouble, you know? And my sister… she had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself very well. Smoked a lot. Mostly… nothing else that I can think of. It’s… hard to remember, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much. It wasn't like here, you see.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, cardiac issues, and diabetes in the family. Understandable that details are limited. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. And not much. Just… a small glass. It helps me sleep sometimes, but mostly I just drink water. I try to stay healthy, you see. Even though this… face keeps happening. I wish I knew what was causing it.
DOCTOR: Minimal alcohol consumption. Alright. Now, let's perform a quick physical examination. I'll need to check your blood pressure and heart rate, and briefly examine your face. Please sit back and relax. I’ll need to palpate your face to note any changes in temperature or texture.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… fine. I’ll sit. Just tell me if it’s going to be cold. My skin is a bit sensitive, you see. And… it might be red already. I was talking to the receptionist a few minutes ago and I think it started up a little bit. It does that sometimes. Just when I talk to people. It’s embarrassing, really. I’m fine though. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Palpation reveals… mild warmth to both cheeks. No palpable masses or lesions. Skin texture is normal. Visual inspection confirms… mild erythema to the nasal bridge and cheeks. It is present, even at rest. We’ll need to rule out rosacea, of course. But the intermittent nature is somewhat atypical.
PATIENT: Rosacea? Is that… serious, Doctor? I’ve never heard of that. Is it… contagious? I don’t want to give it to anyone. I go to the market a lot, you see. And I don’t want to be spreading anything around. It’s just… this redness. I wish I knew what was causing it. Could it be… stress? Even though I don’t feel particularly stressed. It’s just… it happens sometimes. I'm fine though. Tell me about this… rosacea.
DOCTOR: Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels. It's not contagious, Mr. Withycombe. It’s not an infection. The cause is unknown, though genetic predisposition and environmental factors are thought to play a role. It typically presents with persistent facial redness, flushing, bumps, and visible blood vessels. It’s usually not a serious condition, but it can be… unsightly. However, the intermittent nature of your presentation is somewhat unusual for typical rosacea. We will require blood work to rule out other potential causes, such as carcinoid syndrome. It is a rare possibility, but we must be thorough.
PATIENT: Carcinoid… syndrome? That sounds… very serious, Doctor. Is that… like cancer? I don’t… I don’t think I have cancer. I feel fine. Just this… redness. Could it just be… my skin? Maybe I’m just… sensitive? I’ve always had sensitive skin. My wife used to say so. Maybe it's nothing? I don't want blood work if it's just… my skin. I don't like needles. And… cancer sounds very frightening. Is it likely? Tell me… is it likely I have this… carcinoid? It's just this face, Doctor. Just the redness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, please try to remain calm. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition caused by tumors that release hormones into the bloodstream. It’s unlikely, but we must rule it out due to the flushing you describe. The blood work is a standard procedure to investigate the cause of your symptoms. Dismissing it as “just your skin” would be… irresponsible medical practice. I understand your apprehension about needles, but this is a necessary step in determining the correct diagnosis. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a serotonin level. It is the only responsible course of action. We’ll proceed methodically.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you… if you think it's necessary. But… are you sure? It sounds very serious. And I don’t like needles. Not at all. Could we… could we start with just a small amount of blood? And… could you maybe tell me a little bit more about this… serotonin? What does that have to do with my face? My wife… she always said I worried too much. And… I think she was right. Just… please be quick. And… gentle. And tell me if it’s going to hurt. I don't want to faint.
DOCTOR: We will take a small sample, Mr. Withycombe. And I assure you, the discomfort is minimal. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, and elevated levels can be indicative of carcinoid syndrome. I will personally ensure the procedure is as comfortable as possible. However, constant questioning and expressed anxiety are not conducive to a productive medical evaluation. I need you to trust my professional judgment. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. Please try to remain calm. .
