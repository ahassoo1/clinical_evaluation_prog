DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bakan. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the use of masks, or… protective equipment, I suppose. I have some difficulty with them, and I believe I need to request an exemption.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. A request for a medical exemption regarding mask usage at your workplace. That’s perfectly reasonable. To properly assess your situation and complete any necessary documentation, could you tell me a bit more about the difficulties you're experiencing with the masks?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… difficult to explain, exactly. It’s not a pain, or an allergy, not in the way most folks describe. It’s more a… a feeling of being closed in. A tightness in my chest, a little trouble breathing, a sort of… panic, I guess you could call it. It doesn’t happen every time, mind you. But enough that it makes doing my job… unsafe, both for me and those I assist. It began a few months back, when the rules changed and they became… mandatory, all the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’re experiencing some anxiety-related symptoms when wearing a mask, specifically a sensation of tightness and some difficulty breathing, accompanied by a feeling of panic. It’s good that it doesn’t happen every time, but enough to be concerning and affect your work. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the type of mask you're using?
PATIENT: It’s the… the blue paper ones, mostly. The disposable kind. My employer provides them. They’re… fairly standard, I believe. They tie around the ears, and have a metal strip to pinch around the nose. We’re also required to wear a face shield over those, sometimes. It seems to be the mask itself that causes the trouble, more than the shield. I’ve tried different sizes, but it doesn’t seem to help much. They all feel… constricting.
DOCTOR: Okay, the standard disposable blue paper masks with ear loops and a nose strip, sometimes combined with a face shield. And you’ve tried different sizes without much relief from the feeling of constriction. Now, Mr. Knabenshue, have you ever experienced anything like this before—perhaps feelings of anxiety or panic in other situations?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Not… exactly like this. I served for a time, you see, with the National Guard. There was… stressful situations there, certainly. And I felt fear, of course. But this is different. It's… not a fear of something, it's a fear in something. Being… contained. It’s a difficult thing to put into words. Before that, no. I've always been a fairly… calm person. I enjoy the quiet of the land, mostly. This feeling… it's new.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Knabenshue. Your service with the National Guard provides some context, and it's helpful to understand that this feeling is new and distinct from any fear you may have experienced previously. The sensation of being contained seems to be the key trigger. To help me rule out any other potential causes, let’s go through a brief review of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or any diagnosed anxiety disorders?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. I’ve been fortunate, mostly healthy my whole life. I have some aches and pains, as one does getting on in years, but nothing diagnosed. I see Dr. Olsen for regular check-ups, and she tells me my heart is strong. No asthma, no breathing troubles, and never any talk of anxiety. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, that's about it. Medicare covers that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. No diagnosed medical conditions, and you have a history of regular check-ups with Dr. Olsen, who has confirmed a strong heart. You only take a vitamin D supplement. Now, regarding any past surgeries or hospitalizations, have you had any significant medical procedures in your life?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. I broke my arm as a boy, fell from a tree while trying to rescue a kite. They set it in a cast, and it healed up just fine. And I had my tonsils out when I was younger, but that was routine, I believe. Nothing else. No serious illnesses, no surgeries as an adult. I’ve always been… careful. Avoided trouble when I could. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm in childhood and a tonsillectomy – nothing else significant. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My mother lived to be 87, strong woman, never much sick at all. She died of old age, mostly. My father passed when I was young, heart trouble, I believe. He was a rancher, hard life, you know? My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had some trouble with her lungs, later in life. But that was long ago. Nobody that I know of suffered from… anxiety, or anything like that. Mostly a strong, hardy lot, my family. Used to the land, the weather… tough folks.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. No history of anxiety in your family, and generally a healthy and hardy lineage. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, one final few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother… she disliked the smell something awful. And I always figured it wasn’t a good habit. I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the mornings, though. Black, no sugar. That's about it for indulgences. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I walk when I can, when the weather permits. I live a quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Knabenshue. A healthy lifestyle with no tobacco use, and you enjoy walking and a sensible diet. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s happening, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perhaps take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed as you see fit. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if a quick examination helps, then I’m happy to cooperate. I’ve always believed in… proper assessment, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll have a seat on the table, we can begin. Your heart sounds strong and regular, no murmurs or abnormal rhythms detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Everything appears physically normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of this exam, it appears you are experiencing anxiety-related symptoms triggered by wearing a mask, specifically the sensation of being constricted. It doesn’t appear to be related to any underlying physical condition.
PATIENT: That… makes a good deal of sense, Doctor. I’m relieved to hear there’s nothing… physically wrong with me. I suppose I’ve always been a… a free spirit, you see. The feeling of being closed in… it’s just… unsettling. What are my options, then? If I need an exemption, what sort of documentation would be required? And is there anything… anything I can do to make it easier? To… tolerate the masks, if necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Knabenshue. It's good to know we've ruled out any underlying physical cause. Now, regarding an exemption, most employers require a note stating that a medical condition makes mask-wearing unsafe or detrimental to your health. I can certainly provide that for you, outlining your anxiety-related symptoms and their trigger. As for making it easier to tolerate the masks, there are a few strategies we can explore. Have you considered relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, before and during mask usage?
PATIENT: I have not, Doctor. I’ve never been one for… such things, I suppose. My methods were always simpler. A quiet walk, a cup of coffee, fresh air… I’ve never had to… manage anxiety before. Deep breathing exercises, you say? Are those… effective? And if they are, how does one… go about doing them properly? I am willing to try, of course, but I am… a bit unfamiliar with the process. And would that be sufficient to… allow me to continue my work, without endangering myself or others?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Knabenshue. Relaxation techniques are not for everyone, but they can be quite effective in managing anxiety symptoms. Deep breathing exercises are a good starting point. They help regulate your heart rate and reduce feelings of panic. To perform them properly, you can try this: Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and slowly inhale deeply through your nose, counting to four. Hold your breath for a count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to six. Focus on your breath and try to relax your muscles as you exhale. Repeat this process several times. There are also guided meditation apps and videos available online that can assist you. Whether this will be sufficient to allow you to continue your work safely is difficult to say with certainty. It depends on the severity of your symptoms and your ability to manage your anxiety. We could also discuss a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders, who can provide more tailored strategies and coping mechanisms. However, if these exercises are effective, and you feel comfortable and safe wearing a mask, that may be sufficient. Would you like me to provide the exemption note, and perhaps some resources for guided breathing exercises?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be most appreciated. The exemption note would be… immensely helpful. And some resources for those… breathing exercises would be kind as well. I am willing to give them a try, if it means I can continue my work. I believe it's important, you see. Assisting others… it gives me purpose. And if it comes to it, I suppose I could consider talking to a therapist, but I would prefer to exhaust other options first. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. I feel… much better now, knowing there’s a course of action.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could provide some clarity and a path forward. I will prepare the exemption note for you now, outlining your anxiety related to mask usage, and I’ll also print out a list of resources for guided breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. Here you are. The note is signed and dated, and the resources should be helpful. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. I recommend starting with the breathing exercises and seeing how you feel. If you find they aren’t sufficient, we can certainly discuss a referral to a therapist. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. You have been most helpful, and I truly appreciate your time and attention. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. I believe I can manage from here. Have a good day, Doctor Bakan. And thank you once more.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could assist you. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if needed. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day as well, Mr. Knabenshue.
