DOCTOR: Good morning, Moshe. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been treated for sleep apnea for a while now, with the machine, you know, the CPAP… and it mostly works. But I still find myself awfully tired during the day. It’s just… inconvenient, and a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use. That’s definitely something we should look into. It’s good you’ve been treated for sleep apnea already – that’s a big first step. Could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. It’s more… a constant feeling of being sluggish, you know? Like I haven't quite woken up. And it makes it hard to concentrate. I used to love reading, but lately, I find my mind wanders after just a few pages. Even just chatting with friends can be a struggle sometimes, because I’m… foggy. It’s worse in the afternoons, generally. Though some days are better than others, I suppose. It's hard to pin down exactly why it's worse on certain days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more of a persistent sluggishness and difficulty concentrating, worse in the afternoons, and it varies day to day. That’s helpful. Just to get a clearer picture, about how many hours of sleep would you say you’re getting each night, on average?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I try for eight, Doctor, I really do. But… it’s hard to say exactly. With the machine, it's not always a restful sleep, you know? Sometimes I wake up a few times to adjust the mask, or just because I'm uncomfortable. I’d say… maybe six and a half, on a good night? And maybe only five or six on the worse nights. It’s hard to tell for sure when you’re waking up during the night. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It’s common for people using CPAP to have disrupted sleep even if the machine is on. Let’s talk a little bit about the CPAP itself. How long have you been using it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… it’ll be five years this November, Doctor. Five years! The doctor at the time – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – said I needed it right away. I was pretty bad, she explained. I’ve been pretty good about using it, I think. Most nights, anyway. I travel sometimes, to visit my daughter in Florida, and I always take it with me. Though those nights aren’t always the best, what with different beds and… everything. But generally, I stick to it. I clean it regularly, too, like they told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of consistent use, with occasional disruptions when travelling. That’s good to hear. And you’re diligent about cleaning it, which is excellent. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any snoring, even with the CPAP machine on?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky one, Doctor. My wife and I divorced a few years back, so I haven’t had anyone to really tell me. Before that, she used to complain, of course, terribly. But… honestly, I can’t say if it’s still happening now. I suppose I might snore a little if I’m really congested, but it’s hard to know for sure. I sleep alone now, you see. And I wouldn’t be aware of it even if I was. Sorry, that’s probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Moshe. It's understandable you wouldn't know. Let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have a touch of high blood pressure, but it’s pretty well controlled with medication. And my cholesterol is a little high, too. The doctor keeps an eye on it. Apart from that… oh! I had a hip replacement about ten years ago. It still gives me a little trouble sometimes, especially in cold weather. But generally, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to walk every day, when the weather permits. And I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a history of hip replacement. Good to know. And you’re staying active which is excellent. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. And for the cholesterol, I’m on Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams. That’s it for the prescriptions. Oh, and sometimes I take a little Tylenol for my hip, when it’s acting up, but not very often. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I stopped a while back. I can’t really remember why, to be honest. I think Dr. Ramirez told me it wasn't really helping. Do you want me to be more specific about anything, Doctor? I have a list at home, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and occasional Tylenol for your hip. That’s good information. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any family members who have sleep disorders, like sleep apnea or narcolepsy?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. My father snored terribly, but that was just… my father. He was a big man, and always snored. My mother didn't have any sleep problems that I know of. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away a long time ago, and nobody really talked about those things back then. So, no, I don’t think there’s any family history of sleep disorders, but I couldn’t say for certain. It’s possible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of sleep disorders. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your daily habits. Do you drink caffeine or alcohol?
PATIENT: Yes, I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, like I mentioned before. Usually just one, sometimes two if it’s a special occasion. And I drink one cup of coffee in the morning, with breakfast. It helps me get going, you see. I don't drink coffee after noon, though, because it keeps me up at night. And I don't smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a good cigar, years ago, but I gave that up a long time ago. My wife didn't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, one to two glasses of wine with dinner, one cup of coffee in the morning, and no smoking. Thank you, Moshe. That’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. It's just… tiring, being tired all the time, you know? Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best, Moshe. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. No enlarged lymph nodes. Your throat looks normal. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Given your history and exam, it sounds like your sleepiness could be due to a few things – potentially suboptimal CPAP therapy, underlying medical conditions contributing to fatigue, or even sleep hygiene issues. I'd like to order a sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and rule out other sleep disorders. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. A sleep study. Yes, absolutely. If it helps figure things out, I'm all for it. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss being able to concentrate, to read… to just enjoy life without feeling constantly exhausted. So, yes, please. Let's do the sleep study. Will I have to go somewhere special for it?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Moshe. And we will do our best to get you feeling like yourself again. Yes, you’ll need to go to a sleep lab for the study. There's a very good one affiliated with the hospital, just a few miles from here. You’ll spend the night there, and they’ll monitor your brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and oxygen levels while you sleep. It's a comfortable setting, like a private hotel room. We'll get you scheduled for that. In the meantime, let’s review a few things you can do at home. First, make sure you’re practicing good sleep hygiene. That means going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. And try to relax before you go to sleep – maybe take a warm bath or read a book. I also want you to keep a sleep diary for the next week or so. Write down what time you go to bed, what time you wake up, how many times you wake up during the night, and how you feel when you wake up in the morning. That will give us some more information to work with. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very manageable, Doctor. A sleep diary. I can certainly do that. And I’ll try my best with the sleep hygiene, too. Dark, quiet, cool… I think I can arrange that. It's just… old habits, you know? Going to bed late, having that glass of wine… But I'm willing to try anything. And the sleep lab… is it comfortable? I'm not a fan of hospitals, if I'm honest. A bit… unsettling. But I understand it’s necessary, if we want to get to the bottom of this. Will I be hooked up to a lot of wires? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel uneasy about hospitals, Moshe. The sleep lab is quite different from the hospital itself. It’s designed to be as comfortable as possible. It really is more like a private hotel room. And you won’t be “hooked up” to a lot of wires, not in the way you might imagine. There are a few sensors attached to your scalp, chest, and legs – they're small and relatively unobtrusive. A technician will be there to help you get set up, and they’ll monitor you throughout the night. You’ll be able to sleep comfortably, and they won't bother you unless you need assistance. We’ll also review your sleep diary and the results of the sleep study together when it's complete. Depending on the findings, we may need to adjust your CPAP settings, consider other therapies, or investigate other potential causes of your fatigue. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. That all sounds very… thorough. And reassuring, honestly. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so carefully. It puts my mind at ease, a little bit. Let me just ask one thing… how long does it usually take to get the results back from the sleep study? I'm a bit anxious, I suppose, to know what's going on. And I'm hoping we can figure it out soon. I miss feeling… normal.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Moshe. It's natural to want answers as quickly as possible. Usually, it takes about a week to ten days to get the results back from the sleep study. The technicians need time to analyze the data and prepare a comprehensive report. Once I have the report, I'll review it carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings with you in detail. I'll also give you a call if anything urgent comes up. And in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a referral for the sleep lab, and a form for the sleep diary. I’ll see you in about a week or ten days, or sooner if we need to. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit more optimistic now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you soon, then.
