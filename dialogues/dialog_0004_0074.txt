DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my blood pressure’s been a little high lately, the nurse said. Seems to be gettin’ worse, and I figured I best get it checked proper. Don't want no strokes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. High blood pressure is something we want to address promptly. And you are right to be proactive. Now, when you say "lately," could you tell me approximately how long has your blood pressure been elevated?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe three, four months now? Hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, y'know? Sometimes I feel fine, other times… a little dizzy. Mostly just tired, though. Is that… is that from the pressure? I don't rightly know.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and fatigue can be symptoms of elevated blood pressure, although they can also be caused by a number of other things. We’ll need to investigate further to determine the cause. So, three to four months… has anything changed in your life during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Same old, same old. I bake pies for the market, like always. Widowed now for ten years… Earl passed, bless his heart. No kids, just me and the recipes. I try to stay active, but this heat… Lord, it’s been awful hot this summer. Makes it hard to even stand in the kitchen sometimes. Don't think that's the reason, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned baking pies for the market. How often are you doing that, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, most days. Four, five days a week, easy. Depends on the orders, you know? Folks like my pecan and apple. I used to have help, but… well, it’s just me now. Lots of standing, lots of mixing… it's a good bit of work, I tell ya. It keeps me busy, though. Don't like sittin' still.
DOCTOR: That is a good deal of physical activity. Now, Ms. Steines, have you ever been formally diagnosed with high blood pressure before today?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never. Doc Miller checked me a few years back, said I was a little on the high side, told me to watch my salt. That's about it. But he retired, and I haven’t been to a doctor regular since. Just… figured I was okay. Now I’m wonderin' if I was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you been taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter remedies, for anything?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, sometimes. Makes bakin' easier when they ain't achin’ so bad. It’s one of them creams, you rub it on. Don't think that would mess with my blood pressure, would it? I forget the name of it, now... old lady problems, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It's good you tell me everything, even what seems small. We'll look into that. Now, Ms. Steines, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin'. My mama always said I was a tough little thing. Still am, I guess. Unless this pressure gets the best of me... Can't rightly recall ever bein’ allergic to a thing. Bees stung me a time or two, but that just swelled up a bit, didn't kill me. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a bee sting doesn’t typically count as a true allergy. Alright. Now, I'd like to get a better picture of your overall health. Let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Now that you mention it, things ain’t been quite as sharp as they used to be. Mostly when I'm readin' recipes, gotta hold 'em closer. Thought it was just my age, though. Everything gets blurry eventually, right? I don't have trouble seein' things far off, just the small print. Maybe I need new glasses. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," but it's good we're discussing it. Changes in vision can sometimes be related to blood pressure. Now, have you been experiencing any headaches lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit. Not terrible, but a dull ache behind my eyes sometimes. Comes and goes. I figured it was from strainin' myself at the market, or maybe not gettin' enough sleep. It ain’t been bad enough to bother with, really. Just… there. Does that make sense? Old people ache all over, you know?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Now, have you been experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a bit. My chest feels fine. And I can breathe alright, as long as I don’t go runnin’ marathons. Just get a little winded walkin' up the hill to the market sometimes. But no pain, no trouble breathin’. Thank the Lord for that. Never had heart trouble in my family.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, Ms. Steines, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, of course. Then I'll take a look at your eyes and listen to your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Been comin' to doctors most of my life, ain't never had a bad experience. Just get this pressure figured out, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 162 over 98. Pulse is 78 and regular. Reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Now, let's take a look at your eyes. I see some mild arteriolar narrowing, which could be related to long-standing hypertension. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound good, does it? That "narrowing"… is that bad? And that "murmur”… I ain’t ever heard of those things before. I always figured if somethin’ was wrong, I’d feel it. What does it all mean, Doctor? I'm startin' to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Steines. It's good you're asking questions. The arteriolar narrowing I saw in your eyes can be a sign of chronic hypertension – high blood pressure over a long period of time. And the murmur is a slightly unusual sound when I listen to your heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. The important thing is that we’ve identified some potential issues that need to be addressed. Now, based on your history and the findings of this exam, I believe you likely have essential hypertension. It's the most common type of high blood pressure, and often doesn't have a single, identifiable cause. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity. I also recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor to get a more accurate reading of your blood pressure throughout the day and night. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that… blood work and monitors and panels… sounds mighty complicated. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I guess so. I just want to feel like myself again. Tired of feelin' this achy and dizzy. And if it helps get this pressure under control, then I'll do whatever you think is right. 24-hour monitor… do I have to go somewhere special for that? I don’t drive much anymore, and my niece, bless her heart, is awful busy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. It is a bit complicated, but we’ll take it one step at a time. And you won't have to go anywhere special for the monitor. The nurse will be able to apply it right here in the office, and you’ll wear it for 24 hours. It's a small, portable device that records your blood pressure automatically. You’ll go about your normal routine as much as possible, and then return it to us tomorrow. As for the blood work, we can draw it right here as well. I'll write the orders now. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend starting a low-sodium diet and getting regular, moderate exercise, if you're able. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. We can discuss medications once we have the blood work results, to determine the best course of action. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds alright. Low salt, walkin’… I can do that. Used to walk more, before Earl passed. Still got my walkin' shoes, somewhere. And I'm good at followin' recipes, so I reckon I can manage the salt. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything so nicely, and I don't feel so scared now. Just… gettin’ this under control is all I want. It’s been weighin’ on my mind somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Steines. It’s my job to help you feel better, and to ease your concerns. We’ll work together to get this under control. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the 24-hour monitor. She’ll also give you some informational handouts on low-sodium diets and healthy exercise. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe headache, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you covered everything. Thank you again for takin' the time to listen, and for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate it more than you know. Just...gettin' this monitor on, I suppose. I’ll try not to worry too much ‘til I hear from you. .
