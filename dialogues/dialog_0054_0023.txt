DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts sometimes. It's... in my breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That’s definitely something we need to look into. When you say “in your breast,” do you mean directly in the breast tissue itself, or more like in the chest wall area?
PATIENT: Um... directly in the breast, I think. Like, where... you know, where a woman's... boob is. It's weird, I know. A man having breast pain.
DOCTOR: It’s not weird at all, Mr. Bulaong. Men can experience breast pain, although it's less common. It’s good you brought it to my attention. To help me understand what might be going on, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad to hear it’s not... too strange. Uh... it's like... a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels sharp, but not often. And it's not always in the same spot. It kind of moves around a little. It hurts more when I... move my arm. Like, when I lift something heavy for work.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache with occasional sharp pain that moves around, and it's worse with arm movement, particularly lifting. That’s helpful. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Not much. Maybe... when I don't move it. When I just sit and rest. But I gotta work, you know? I'm a roofer. Can't just sit all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. Roofing is demanding physical work. Okay, so pain is lessened with rest. Have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Changes? Like... what kind of changes? I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I just felt the pain. I didn’t think to look at it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. Many people don't think to examine the area unless something specifically prompts them to. Let me ask you this – have you noticed any redness, swelling, dimpling, or any discharge from the nipple?
PATIENT: Discharge? No! No discharge. Nothing coming out of… there. Redness… maybe a little sometimes. After work, when it's been hurting a lot. But I thought that was just from rubbing against my shirt. Swelling… I don’t think so. I haven’t really noticed. Dimpling… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Dimpling is like an indentation in the skin, a slight inward curve. Okay, so some redness after work that you attribute to rubbing, and no discharge or noticeable swelling. Have you felt any lumps or thickening in the breast area?
PATIENT: Lumps… ... I think… yeah. Maybe. There’s something… hard. Not big, but… it’s there. I didn't think much of it. I figured it was just a muscle knot or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. A lump you hadn’t previously noticed. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to gently feel around your chest and under your armpits. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that's okay. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling around now. I do feel a small, firm lump in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast. It's approximately one centimeter in size, and it doesn't seem to move much when I gently try to shift it. There’s some mild tenderness to the touch. Your lymph nodes in your armpit are not significantly enlarged on either side. Does that feel accurate to what you were experiencing?
PATIENT: Yeah… that’s about right. It’s there. It doesn’t move much, you’re right. And it hurts when you press on it. I didn’t tell you, but… my wife, she said I should come see a doctor. She felt it too.
DOCTOR: That was smart of her, Mr. Bulaong, and I’m glad she encouraged you to come in. Given the lump, its firmness, and the tenderness, we need to investigate this further. While it could be a number of things—even something benign—it’s important to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a mammogram and an ultrasound of your left breast. These imaging tests will give us a better look at the lump and help determine what it is. Would you have any trouble getting to a radiology center for these tests?
PATIENT: Radiology… uh… I don’t know. I don’t have a car. My wife usually drives, but she's working a lot right now. Is it… far? And… how much does it cost? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very important thing to consider, especially without insurance. The radiology center is about a 20-minute bus ride from here. Let me see if I can find a center that offers financial assistance programs or a sliding scale for patients without insurance. I’ll also see if there are any mobile mammography units that come closer to your area. In the meantime, it’s important to remember that early detection is key. I will have my nurse, Sarah, speak with you about the options available for financial assistance and scheduling. I also want to emphasize this: a lump doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cancer. However, we need to get it checked out to be sure. Would you be comfortable with me referring you to a general surgeon as well?
PATIENT: Okay… financial help would be good. Anything to help with the cost. And… yeah, a surgeon sounds… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bulaong. And I assure you, we’re taking this seriously, but we’re also being cautious. A surgeon can evaluate the imaging results and, if necessary, perform a biopsy to determine exactly what the lump is made of. It's the most definitive way to get an answer. I'll write a referral for Dr. Evelyn Ramirez, a very experienced general surgeon. Sarah will give you her contact information along with resources for financial assistance and scheduling the mammogram and ultrasound. To recap: I'm ordering a mammogram and ultrasound. I’m referring you to Dr. Ramirez for evaluation. And Sarah will help you with scheduling and financial assistance. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You explained it really well. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for trying to help with the cost. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It's my job to help, and we will do everything we can to get you the answers you need. Sarah will be in shortly to go over the details. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your appointments. Take care, and try not to worry too much until we have more information.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. Take care. .
