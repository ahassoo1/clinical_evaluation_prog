DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re…well, they hurt, and they’re really red. Been bothering me for a few weeks now. Not sure what they are.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe a month or so. It started with just one, I think, and now there's...a good few of them. They're not itchy, thankfully, just painful if I bump them or…even sometimes when I’m just walking.
DOCTOR: Painful, not itchy. Alright. And have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so, really. They seem to just be…there. Maybe a little worse after a long day at work, you know, being on my feet a lot? But I haven't noticed anything specific that makes them go away or get much worse. I wear work boots all day, though. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Work boots…potentially. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: I move freight, mostly. Hand loading and unloading. It’s…physical work. Lots of walking and bending. Been doing it a long time. It's honest work, but it can be hard on the body, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine. Alright. Let's take a look at these bumps, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Go ahead. They're right here… Careful, they're a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. They’re firm, raised…and definitely erythematous, as you said. No warmth to the touch currently. Are there any open sores or drainage at all?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, nothing like that. They’re just…bumps. Red and sore. I clean them with soap and water every night, but they don't seem to be getting any better. I haven't noticed any pus or anything like that, thankfully. Just…pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No fever, no chills, no aches. Just these bumps on my legs. Appetite's normal, sleeping okay… I guess that’s it. I’m getting old, though. Everything aches something sometimes, you know? But these are different. These hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've described and the examination, it’s possible these are shin splints, or more accurately, chronic venous insufficiency with stasis dermatitis. They often present as painful, red bumps, particularly after prolonged standing or physical activity. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Doppler…ultrasound? And a blood test? That sounds…serious. What would those tests show, Doctor? And what if it is something serious? I just want to know what’s going on with my legs. I don't want anything to stop me from working, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Aluia. We're simply gathering information to confirm the diagnosis. The Doppler ultrasound will show us if there's any blockage or insufficiency in the veins, and the blood test will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the problem. The vast majority of cases like this are managed conservatively—compression stockings, elevation, and keeping an eye on things. However, it’s important to rule out things like deep vein thrombosis, although that's less likely given the presentation. Would you like me to explain those tests in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Okay…conservative, you say? That sounds better. Compression stockings…I think I’ve heard of those. And no…no thrombosis, that sounds scary. Yes, please, explain the tests. Just…tell me what they’ll do, and what they’re looking for. And…how long will it take? I have to get back to work, you know? Not trying to rush you, but…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Aluia. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive. A technician will apply a gel to your legs and then use a handheld device to create images of the veins. It’s painless, though you may feel some pressure. It will take about 30-45 minutes. The blood test is a simple draw, and will take just a few minutes. We'll send it to the lab and should have results back within a couple of business days. It is important to rule out other potential causes, as prolonged venous insufficiency can lead to skin ulcers if left untreated. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay…30-45 minutes for the ultrasound, a few minutes for the blood…and a couple of days for the results. No ulcers, you say? That doesn’t sound good. Okay, I understand. So, we do the tests, and then we see what they say? And you’ll explain everything to me when the results come back?
DOCTOR: Precisely. My nurse will schedule you for the ultrasound and draw the blood now. I'll review the results with you when they are available, and we'll discuss a plan of action at that time. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. Let’s get these tests done, and hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. Where do I go to get them scheduled?
DOCTOR: My nurse, Sarah, is just outside. She'll guide you through the scheduling process and answer any remaining questions. I'll see you when the results are back.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well.
