DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... something down there. A little... leak, you know? Not good. It’s been a few days, maybe? Hard to say, time goes so fast when you’re older. It's... messy. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: "A leak," you say. Messy, and for a few days. Alright. Now, when you say "down there," are you referring to vaginal discharge, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Vagi-what? No, not there. Down there. You know... between the legs. For a man. It’s my grandson’s problem, really. He sent me. He’s too embarrassed to come himself. He says it's... dripping. Like a leaky faucet. Is that what you call it, dripping?
DOCTOR: Ah. I see. You’re not experiencing this yourself, but it's your grandson who's having the issue. And you're here on his behalf. Okay. So, this dripping... is it from his penis?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! The... the thingy. It’s coming from there. And it smells... funny. Not a good funny, you know? Like old fish. He's been trying to clean it, but it just keeps happening. He's a good boy, my grandson. Works hard. Doesn’t deserve this. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, it makes sense, though perhaps… not entirely clear. A discharge from his penis, with an odor you describe as "fishy." How old is your grandson, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Age? Hmm. He's... grown. Definitely not a little boy anymore. Let me think… he turned… something last year? Twenty-something, I think. Maybe 25? He's got a beard now, that's for sure. A full beard. He likes to work on cars. Always greasy hands, that one. It's hard to keep track, you know? Time just slips away.
DOCTOR: Twenty-something. Alright. And this discharge… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not all the time. He says it’s worse after… you know… after he spends time with a girl. If he's been… busy. That’s what he told me, anyway. He doesn’t tell me everything, of course. A young man’s secrets. But he said it gets worse then. And it stains his underwear. He’s embarrassed about that, poor thing.
DOCTOR: After sexual activity, you say. And it stains his underwear. Is he experiencing any pain or burning when he urinates?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. He didn’t say anything about pain. He just said it was… uncomfortable. A little itchy sometimes. And he feels… shy. Very shy. He’s a good boy, always been polite. Doesn’t like to complain. I had to practically drag him to get me to bring him here. He thought it would just… go away. Boys think everything will just go away, don't they?
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, just discomfort and itchiness. I see. It sounds like your grandson may be experiencing symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection. It's not something to be embarrassed about, Ms. Genard, but it does require medical attention. We'll need to do a quick examination and some tests to confirm. Is he agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Sexually… what now? Oh dear. That sounds… bad. He didn’t say anything about… that. A good boy! He wouldn't! Examination? Tests? Oh, goodness. He's going to be so mad at me. He really didn't want to come. I just wanted to help. He's probably already regretting sending me. I don’t know if he’ll let you… poke around. He’s very private, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, with all due respect, attempting to diagnose without a proper examination is irresponsible. While I understand your grandson's discomfort, delaying treatment could lead to complications. The examination is quick and confidential. We can also discuss options for discreet testing. However, I need to assess the situation to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you're making me feel terrible now. No, he's not here. He dropped me off, said he’d wait in the car. Too embarrassed, you see? I just wanted to see if it was something serious. He's a hard worker, that boy. Doesn’t want to get sick. I didn’t realize it was so… complicated. Can't you just give him something for it? Some cream or pills? He’s probably already wishing he hadn’t sent me. Is this going to take long? I have bingo tonight.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you bringing him in. However, prescribing medication without knowing what we're treating is simply not ethical. And frankly, I cannot provide any treatment based on second-hand information and a description of "messiness." It sounds like your grandson needs a proper medical evaluation. If he’s unwilling to allow me to examine him, I’m afraid I can’t help. I can, however, recommend a specialist who might be more… accommodating. Perhaps a urologist?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A urologist? What’s that? Sounds… scary. He’s going to be so upset. This is all so much trouble. I just wanted to help my grandson. I don't want to cause any trouble for him. He's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve this. Maybe it will just go away. I think I just want to go home now. And get to bingo. Is it okay if I just… leave? And you just tell him to… wash it? I don't understand all this doctor talk. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, with all due respect, simply advising him to “wash it” is not a suitable course of action. However, I understand your distress, and I’m not going to force him to undergo an examination. I strongly advise you to encourage him to see a specialist. I can provide you with a referral list. Here’s a list of urologists in the area. Please, urge him to schedule an appointment. And, Ms. Genard… I wish you luck with your bingo. .
