DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my wife… she want… baby. We old now. I think… we need help to make baby? I make little things with metal, not babies!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, but you're concerned about your age and whether that might make it difficult. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. Just to clarify, you’re 70 years old, and your wife is also hoping to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Seventy. I… I think so. Time… goes fast. My wife… she is… a little younger. Not so old like me. Maybe… sixty? I don't remember exactly. We been married long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, you're 70 and your wife is around 60. And you're wondering if age might be a factor in conceiving. It certainly can be, for both of you. Let's talk a little more about your overall health, and your wife's, to get a better picture. First, for you, Manuel, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… problems? Hmm. I had… something with my back, long ago. Work… making things. Heavy things. They give me… pills. Stopped hurting now. And… I go to the doctor sometimes for… check-ups. Normal things. Not big problems. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain that was treated with pills, and regular check-ups. That’s good to know. Do you remember what the check-ups were for specifically?
PATIENT: Check-ups… um… blood? They take blood. And… they look in my ears and eyes. Normal things. I don’t… I don’t remember the names of things. The doctor… she say everything okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Routine bloodwork and a general physical exam. And your wife – does she see a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, my wife… she very careful. She see doctor… more than me. Always checking things. She very healthy. She eat good food, walk every day. She take vitamins. She say it’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear she's so proactive about her health. Do you know if she has any specific medical conditions that her doctor has diagnosed, or any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. She take some pills for… her water. You know, when she get old lady problems? Not big problems, just… to help her sleep. And maybe for her bones. She forget the name. I forget the name too!
DOCTOR: Okay, so some medication for sleep and possibly for her bones. That’s good to know. We can try to get more specific information later if needed. Now, Manuel, have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Um… when I was young… very young… I fall down. Break my arm. They fix it. That’s all I remember. Long time ago. Very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm that was fixed when you were young. Good to know. And have you ever been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Not really. When my wife have baby… I go to hospital with her. But that's not for me! I just… wait with her. I think… maybe once when I was very small, for a bad cough? But I don't remember it very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly just accompanying your wife during her deliveries and possibly a brief hospitalization as a child for a cough. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My family… they all live far away. In Somalia. I don’t see them. I don’t know… my mother, she live long time. My father… he get sick. Something with his breathing. But I don't know what. Everyone get old, you know? Things happen.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to know the medical history of family who live far away. That’s alright. Let’s move on to some lifestyle questions then. Do you smoke, Manuel?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoke. Bad for you. My wife… she don't smoke either. We like fresh air. We walk in the park.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how much alcohol do you typically drink, if any?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Very little. When we have special day… maybe glass of wine with dinner. Not every day. My wife… she maybe drink little bit more than me. But not much. We don't… party much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so very limited alcohol consumption. That's good to know. Now, one final question for now – are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements, besides what you mentioned your wife takes?
PATIENT: Let me think… um… the doctor give me pills for my water. Like my wife. Old man problems, you know? And… sometimes I take something for my knees. They hurt when it’s cold. Small white pills. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pills for your prostate and something for your knees when they hurt. We’ll try to get the names of those later. Now, Manuel, to get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yes, yes. Okay. If you need to look at me… that's fine. I want to make baby, you know? I will do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure. Can you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this?
DOCTOR: Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your pulse. Your pulse is a little fast, but not overly concerning. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but again, not immediately alarming. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the table. Your abdomen feels soft. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… old. Everything is old. Maybe little bit there… on the side. But not big pain. Just… feels funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness there. That could be a number of things. It's not necessarily concerning, but we'll want to keep it in mind. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Now, I'd like to check your prostate. This will involve a brief digital rectal exam. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it's important to assess the size and condition of your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Prostate…? Oh. That… that is not good. But… you say it’s important for baby? Okay. If you need to… do what you need. But… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please take a deep breath. Okay, all done. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common at your age. It doesn't feel concerningly abnormal, but it's something we'll need to monitor. Now, I’m going to take a blood sample. This will help us check your hormone levels, kidney function, and overall health. This will just be a quick pinch.
PATIENT: Pinch…? Okay. I don't like needles. But… for baby. Do it quick, please.
DOCTOR: All done. You did great. Just keep that bandage on for a few minutes. Okay, Manuel, that completes the physical exam. Now we have some bloodwork to send off to the lab. It should take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I want to discuss your options. Given your age and the results of the exam, starting a family naturally may be challenging. However, there are assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization , that could be considered. It's also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to difficulty conceiving. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: IVF…? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don’t understand. What… what does that mean? And… my wife… is it safe for her too? She is not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions. IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. It involves retrieving eggs from your wife, fertilizing them with your sperm in a lab, and then transferring the resulting embryos into her uterus. It is a complicated process, and it can be expensive. As for safety, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. IVF does involve some risks for your wife, such as multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We'd need to thoroughly evaluate her health to determine if she's a good candidate. Before we even consider IVF, I want to get the results of your bloodwork back. That will give us a better understanding of your overall health and hormone levels. We can then discuss all of your options in more detail, including the risks and benefits of each one. Would you like me to refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist?
PATIENT: Endocrinologist…? More doctors? It’s… too much. Maybe… maybe we just wait for bloodwork. See what that says. And then… then we talk again? I don’t want to see more doctors right now. I just want… a baby. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all. And you’re right, let's wait for the bloodwork results first. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us make an informed decision. We don't need to rush into anything. I will also give you some information about assisted reproductive technologies to read over, but there’s no pressure to make any decisions right now. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle – eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing any stress. I’ll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they’re available. I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. Follow up… call. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You… you help me feel a little better. Even if it’s… complicated. Maybe… maybe there is still hope?
DOCTOR: There is always hope, Manuel. And I’m here to help you explore all of your options. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you again. I go home now. Take care of my wife… if you see her.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be happy to meet your wife. You take care as well, Manuel. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. .
