DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… trying to be more present, I guess. I’ve heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I was hoping to talk to you about it. Maybe see if it would be a good fit for me? I work quite a bit with the tracks, and sometimes my mind just… races.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful reason to come in, Ms. Sugino. It’s excellent you’re prioritizing your mental wellbeing. It sounds like you're experiencing some racing thoughts, particularly related to your work with the tracks. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about what those thoughts are like?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s not… anxiety, exactly. It’s more like… I’m always thinking ahead. Checking, re-checking, thinking about what could go wrong, even after everything’s been done properly. Like, did I tighten that bolt enough? Is the signal reading correctly on the next section? It’s not worrying, it’s just… constant. And it makes it hard to switch off when I’m not working, you know? I can replay things in my head for hours.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. It sounds like you have a very conscientious and detail-oriented mind, which is wonderful for your work with the tracks, but it can be exhausting when it doesn’t quiet down. So it’s not so much fear of something going wrong, but more a persistent need to review and anticipate?
PATIENT: Exactly! That’s a really good way to put it. It’s not a panic, or anything. It’s just… a loop. A mental checklist that keeps running, even when there's nothing to check. And it definitely gets worse when I’m tired, or if it’s been a particularly stressful day on the line. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like you're describing a pattern of intrusive thoughts, possibly related to obsessive tendencies, but not necessarily a full-blown obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's good you recognize it's impacting your ability to relax. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. No major illnesses, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, managed with a small dose of medication – just a little one, the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about, just watch the salt. Otherwise, nothing significant. I’m on Medicare, of course, being my age. Do you need to know about vaccinations or anything? I can probably dig out the records if you do.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Sugino. High blood pressure, managed with medication, is helpful information. No need to dig out vaccination records right now, unless something specific comes to mind. And you said you’ve been pretty healthy otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises from work, of course. Working around the tracks isn't exactly a gentle occupation! But nothing that required serious treatment. I’ve always been fairly active, walk a lot, try to eat well… though I do have a sweet tooth, I confess. I’m single, so I’m mostly responsible for looking after myself, which is fine. I like my routine. Is there anything else you need to know about my health? Perhaps family history? My mother had arthritis, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Ms. Sugino. Thank you. Arthritis in your mother is good to note. It sounds like you prioritize a healthy lifestyle despite the sweet tooth, which is wonderful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current medications. You mentioned a small dose for blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. The name… oh dear, I’m terrible with names. I just know I take it every morning with my breakfast. I can check the bottle when I get home, I’m sure. It’s… 5 milligrams, I think? Or maybe 10? It’s a small amount, honestly. The doctor just said to keep an eye on my numbers and make sure I don’t skip it. I’m pretty good at remembering to take it, thankfully. Routine, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Sugino, don’t worry about it. It’s helpful to know it’s a small dose and that you're consistent with taking it. We can always verify the exact name and dosage later. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had any problems with bee stings or anything like that either. My mother was allergic to pollen, but I seem to have skipped that one. Honestly, I’m quite lucky in that regard. No allergies at all. Is that unusual?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sugino! No allergies is wonderful. It’s not unusual at all – some people are just less prone to them. Okay, so we’ve covered a lot of good ground. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Vodzak. I trust your judgment. I’m used to being poked and prodded a bit, working with the railway, you know. Safety checks are important! So, just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could just have a seat here on the table, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so, and consistent with your medication. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds and looks good.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear! I always worry a bit when I go to the doctor, you know? Old habits, I suppose. So, everything’s okay? Does that mean we can talk about the mindfulness thing now? I’m really curious to see if it could help with the… looping thoughts.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds good, Ms. Sugino. You're very healthy, and your physical exam didn't reveal anything concerning. And absolutely, let's talk about mindfulness. Based on what you've described – the persistent thoughts, the difficulty switching off, and your overall conscientious nature – it’s very plausible that mindfulness techniques could be helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing what we might call rumination – getting stuck in thought loops. Mindfulness aims to help you observe those thoughts without getting carried away by them, to create some distance. Have you had any prior experience with meditation or other similar practices?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve read a few articles about it, seen things on television, but I’ve never actually tried it. It always seemed a bit… New Age, to be honest. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but it wasn’t really my thing. I’m a practical person, you know? Fixing tracks, making sure everything’s safe – that’s what I do. Sitting and… focusing on my breath just seemed a bit… unproductive, I suppose. But I'm willing to try if you think it could help. I’m just a bit skeptical, I confess.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Sugino. It's good you're honest about your skepticism. Mindfulness can seem a bit abstract, especially for someone who's used to very concrete tasks. But it's not about emptying your mind – it’s about learning to relate to your thoughts differently. Think of it like this: you’re a skilled track inspector. You identify potential problems, assess their severity, and take action. Mindfulness helps you do the same with your thoughts – identify them, assess their helpfulness, and then choose whether to engage with them or let them pass. There are many different ways to practice mindfulness, from formal meditation to simply paying attention to your senses during everyday activities. We could start with a brief guided meditation here in the office, if you’re comfortable, just to give you a feel for it. Or, I could recommend some resources – apps, websites, books – that you could explore at your own pace. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm… perhaps a short guided meditation would be best. Just to see what it’s like. I don’t want to commit to anything long, just yet. And I definitely don’t want to feel pressured. If it feels silly, I’d like to be able to stop. Is that okay? I’m a bit worried I won’t be able to… quiet my mind, you know? It’s always racing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sugino. That’s perfectly fine. No pressure at all. We can stop at any time. It’s very common to find it difficult to quiet your mind – that’s why we practice! It’s not about achieving a state of perfect stillness, but about learning to observe your thoughts without judgment. Just get comfortable in your chair, if you can. You can close your eyes if you're comfortable, or simply lower your gaze. We’ll start with a brief breathing exercise. Just focus on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. And if your mind wanders – which it will – just gently redirect your attention back to your breath. We’ll do this for about five minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Five minutes doesn't sound too bad. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s begin. Take a deep breath in… and slowly exhale. Notice the sensation of the air filling your lungs… and then releasing. Again, take a deep breath in… and slowly exhale. Don’t try to change your breathing, just observe it as it is. You may notice thoughts arising in your mind. That’s perfectly normal. Don't judge them, don’t get carried away by them. Simply acknowledge their presence, and gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Notice the sensation of your body in the chair. Feel the support of the chair beneath you. Now, just let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Observe the sensation of each inhale and exhale. Alright, Ms. Sugino. You can slowly open your eyes when you’re ready. How was that experience for you?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t what I expected. It was… hard. My mind was racing the whole time. I kept thinking about work, about whether I’d locked the shed properly, about what I needed to make for dinner. It was very difficult to focus on my breath. But… I did notice that I was thinking about those things, you know? Like, I was aware of the thoughts, instead of just being caught up in them. Is that what you mean? It’s a bit strange. But maybe… maybe not as silly as I thought. I'm not sure I feel relaxed, exactly, but…different.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful observation, Ms. Sugino. You’ve described the experience perfectly. It’s completely normal for your mind to wander – especially during your first attempt. The key isn't to stop the thoughts, but to become aware of them without getting carried away. You noticed that you were thinking about those things, instead of just being lost in them, and that’s a huge step. It sounds like you have a natural aptitude for mindfulness. It's also perfectly normal not to feel relaxed immediately – it takes practice. Would you be interested in trying a guided meditation app at home?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I think I would. If it’s something I can do on my own, at my own pace, that would be good. I’m not sure I’m ready to sit here and… empty my mind in front of a doctor just yet. An app sounds less intimidating. Do you have any recommendations? Something for beginners, perhaps? I don't want anything too complicated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Headspace and Calm are both excellent apps for beginners. They offer guided meditations of varying lengths and focus on different themes – stress reduction, sleep, focus, and so on. Insight Timer is another good option – it has a large library of free meditations. I personally recommend starting with Headspace – it has a very user-friendly interface and a good introductory course. I can send you some links to those apps after our consultation. Now, do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Vodzak. I still feel a bit skeptical, but I’m willing to give it a try. And thank you for not making me feel silly. It's nice to talk to someone who understands. I think I'll download Headspace tonight and see what it's like. Perhaps it will help with the looping thoughts. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. Remember, mindfulness is a practice – it takes time and patience. Don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t come easily at first. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll send those links over to you after our consultation. Here's a summary of our visit: You presented with persistent, intrusive thoughts related to work, not associated with significant anxiety, and a desire to explore mindfulness techniques. Physical exam was unremarkable. We discussed the benefits of mindfulness and agreed to try a guided meditation app. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, that’s perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Vodzak. I think I'm all set. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and please take care. .
