DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Truth be told, I ain’t been feelin’ the best lately. My blood pressure’s been up, the nurse told me. That’s what brought me in, I reckon. I don't rightly understand all that medical stuff, but she said I needed to see a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: I see. The nurse did mention your blood pressure reading was a bit elevated during your initial assessment. It's perfectly alright if you don't understand all the medical terminology; that's what I'm here for. So, you've been feeling unwell generally, and the elevated blood pressure is the primary concern. Could you describe what you mean by “not feeling the best”?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain or nothin’. More like… tired. Real tired, even after a good night’s sleep. And sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Mostly just feel… worn out, you know? I used to be able to bake all day and still have energy for my garden, but now… not so much. It’s been goin’ on for a few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and dizziness, especially with a change in position, are certainly things we need to investigate. A few months is a significant period of time. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about this dizziness?
PATIENT: It ain't a spinny dizziness, if that makes sense. More like… the room just kinda sways for a second. Doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds, maybe ten at the most. Happens most when I get up from sittin' or lyin' down. Rarely happens when I’m just walkin’ around. And it hasn’t caused me to fall or nothin’ yet, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A brief swaying sensation upon standing is what you're experiencing, not a spinning vertigo. And thankfully, no falls. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see... Well, I had the usual childhood things, measles and such. But nothin' serious. When I was younger, maybe fifty or so, I had a little trouble with my gallbladder, had to have it taken out. Other than that… mostly just aches and pains from gettin’ old, you know? The doctor always said my heart was strong. I don’t recall ever bein’ told I had high blood pressure before this.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of childhood illnesses and gallbladder removal, but otherwise generally healthy. And no prior diagnosis of hypertension until recently. That’s good to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. Helps with the achin’. The name is… hmm… Tramadol, I think. Small dose, doctor said it wasn't a habit-formin' kind. And that’s about it. I don’t take nothin’ else regularly. Just an occasional aspirin for a headache, if I need it.
DOCTOR: Tramadol for arthritis, and occasional aspirin as needed. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat most everything, though I try to stick to healthier stuff these days. My mama always said a good diet was half the battle. I don’t go near bee hives though, always been scared of bees! But that’s a fear, not an allergy, I reckon.
DOCTOR: A sensible fear, indeed! No known allergies, then. That’s good. Now, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, mercy. That’s a long story. My mama lived to be 95, she was a strong woman. She had a little bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, but mostly she was healthy. My daddy… he passed when he was young, a lumber accident. Didn’t have time to get old enough to have heart trouble or nothin’. I have a sister, she’s doin’ okay, but she’s got some sugar trouble, diabetes I think they call it. And that’s about all the family I got left to think about.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. A history of longevity in your mother, a younger passing for your father, and diabetes in your sister. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama didn’t allow it in the house, and I never started. As for drinkin’, I used to have a little glass of wine with supper sometimes, but I haven’t done that in years. Doctor said it wasn’t good for my pressure. And I certainly don’t mess with any of them… recreational drugs. Never saw the point.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: What do you mean by that, Doctor? You mean… who I live with? Well, I live alone now. My husband, bless his soul, passed away ten years ago. We didn’t have any children. I have a few friends I see now and then, but mostly I keep to myself. I like bakin', keeps my hands busy and the house smellin’ nice. And I got a little garden out back, though I ain’t been able to tend it as much lately with feelin’ tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. You live alone, have friends you see occasionally, and enjoy baking and gardening. It's good to stay active, and I'm sorry to hear about your husband. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds fine, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit. Just get it over with, if you please. I got a pie crust waitin’ to be rolled out when I get home.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A pie crust is a worthy goal. Okay, your blood pressure is 160 over 95. A bit elevated, as the nurse noted. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur can be heard. Not immediately concerning, but something we'll want to monitor. Lung sounds are clear. Now I'll check your pulse. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’ll just do a quick neurological assessment. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright. There. I'm followin' it. It's a little hard with these old eyes, but I can see it.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? It ain't as strong as it used to be, but it’s a squeeze.
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. And finally, can you lift your arms and push against my hands?
PATIENT: There. I can do that. It’s a little… stiff, mind you. Arthritis, you know. But I can push.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. That’s all I need for now. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you're experiencing fatigue, dizziness, and elevated blood pressure. The murmur I heard needs further investigation, and the arthritis is likely contributing to some of your fatigue. We need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Land sakes. That’s a lot of tests. But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I don’t like needles much, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the tests, Ms. Steines. It does seem like a lot, but they'll give us a comprehensive picture of your health. The blood tests will require a small blood sample, and yes, there will be a brief pinch from the needle, but it’s usually very quick. The EKG is completely painless; we’ll just place some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than an hour or so for everything to be completed. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An hour… alright. I can manage an hour. And no long needles, I hope? If it’s just a little pinch, I reckon I can handle it. Lead the way, Doctor. I wanna get this over with and get home to my pie.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just a small pinch, I assure you. And we'll get you back to your pie as quickly as possible. The lab technician, Sarah, is excellent and will take good care of you. She’ll explain everything before she starts. "Sarah, this is Ms. Steines. We have a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, and an EKG to perform, please."
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: We’ll talk soon, Ms. Steines. If you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting, please don’t hesitate to let Sarah or I know. .
