DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Mackenzi. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, I’m here for a clearance. A pre-surgery clearance, I believe. For… cosmetic surgery. It’s all a bit… hazy, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright if things are a little fuzzy. We can sort it all out together. Pre-surgery clearance, right. And cosmetic surgery… Do you recall what type of cosmetic surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. I… I think it has something to do with my… face? Perhaps a lift? Or… something with the eyes? It was a very difficult time when I made the appointment, after… after my husband passed. I’m terribly sorry, this is probably very unhelpful. It feels like a dream, almost.
DOCTOR: Not at all unhelpful, Mackenzi. It sounds like you were going through a lot at the time, and it's completely understandable that details are difficult to recall. We'll get the specifics. Do you have any paperwork from the surgeon's office with the procedure listed?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think I do. Just a moment… ah, here! I really hope this is the right one. Everything feels so disorganized lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is a consultation summary from Dr. Ramirez, detailing a planned upper blepharoplasty and brow lift. So, surgery on the eyelids and forehead. Excellent. That’s helpful. Now, to make sure everything’s safe for you to proceed, I’ll need to ask a few questions about your medical history. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Ask away, please. I’ll do my best to answer, though I do apologize in advance if I’m a bit… slow. Or forgetful. It’s just… been a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no problem at all, Mackenzi. Take your time. Let’s start with your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that a doctor has diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. My husband, he always took care of the doctor’s appointments. I… I’ve always been fairly healthy, I think. I’m not one for sweets, and I try to walk when I can. But I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, quite some time. Perhaps a check-up is overdue, now that I think about it. Is high blood pressure something I should be worried about? I occasionally feel a little… lightheaded, but I assumed it was just from the heat.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking about it, Mackenzi. We’ll definitely get you checked out. Lightheadedness can have a lot of causes, and we want to rule out anything serious before proceeding with surgery. High blood pressure is certainly something we’ll check as part of your pre-op assessment. To get a better picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any specific allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I recall. Though… I do get a bit itchy sometimes when I’m gardening. Could that be an allergy? It's usually just to certain plants, I suppose. Roses, mostly. But that’s just a slight irritation, not a full-blown reaction. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible mild reaction to roses, but no known severe allergies. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… I do take something for my… sleep. It's a small, white pill. My doctor – the one before… before my husband passed, he prescribed it. I haven't refilled it in a while, actually. And… oh! I take these every morning, just to keep healthy. That’s all I think. Unless… sometimes I take something for a headache, but it's just… ibuprofen, I believe. The over-the-counter kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sleep medication – do you recall the name of that, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s difficult. It was a small, blue pill, I believe. And the name… it started with a ‘Z’, perhaps? Or maybe a ‘T’? I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. This is quite frustrating, isn’t it? My memory just… fails me. I know it helped me sleep, but the specifics are… lost. It was prescribed a long time ago, when things were… less complicated.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable. We can try to get the records from your previous doctor if you’re comfortable with that. In the meantime, we’ll proceed with caution. Now, let’s talk about your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This would be my first surgery, ever. That’s… a little frightening, to be honest. I’ve always been quite… healthy. Well, until recently, of course. My husband always said I was a strong woman. But this… this is a big step. A new step.
DOCTOR: It's completely natural to feel apprehensive, Mackenzi, especially with it being your first surgery. We'll make sure you're well-prepared and comfortable every step of the way. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your family members have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had something with her heart, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… he was a very healthy man, as far as I know. He always enjoyed gardening. He was a strong, quiet man. I don’t recall any major illnesses on either side of the family, actually. My husband’s family… I wasn't very close to them, so I don’t have much information about their medical history. I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… details escape me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. It’s good you're sharing what you do remember. Knowing about the maternal heart history is helpful. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… it's rather quiet these days, Doctor. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned. It keeps me busy. I try to walk when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I prefer tea, actually. I mostly spend my time at home, tending to my garden and… remembering. It's a peaceful life, though a little lonely, perhaps. I don’t have much of a social life these days, if that’s what you mean. Mostly, I just try to take things one day at a time.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Mackenzi. And it’s good to hear you maintain a healthy routine with the gardening and walking. Now, one last question for the history part. Before we proceed to the exam, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. As I mentioned earlier, I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications. I’ve never needed an EpiPen, and I haven’t had any rashes or swelling from anything. I think I would remember if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I? I’m reasonably certain I’m not allergic to anything, but if I experience a reaction during the surgery, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I trust your judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. That’s very thorough. Thank you. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline reading and ensure you’re healthy enough for surgery. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your expertise completely. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6. All within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Eyes are clear, pupils are equal and reactive to light. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses noted. Everything seems to be in good order so far. Do you have any areas that are bothering you, or any pain to report?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain to report, thankfully. I feel… alright. A little nervous, perhaps, but no actual pain. My joints ache a little sometimes, especially after gardening, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing concerning, I assure you. Everything feels… normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. Good to know. It sounds like you’re in generally good health, which is reassuring. Now, to be completely thorough, I would like to check your reflexes. This will involve tapping certain areas of your body with a small hammer. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed as needed. I trust your judgement. I understand it’s just a routine check, and I want to make sure everything is done properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your leg. Good response, 2+ bilaterally. Biceps and triceps reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally, normal. Plantar reflex is downgoing bilaterally, normal. Everything looks good so far, Mackenzi. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Now, just one final thing. I'd like to quickly listen to your heart again, and a little closer this time, just to be extra cautious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Please, do whatever you need to do to make sure I’m healthy enough for the surgery. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi, everything sounds good. I didn't detect any murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, and your breathing is normal. Overall, your physical examination is within normal limits. You appear to be in good health for a cosmetic procedure. However, given your memory concerns and the time since your last medical check-up, I recommend a comprehensive blood panel and an EKG to rule out any underlying issues before proceeding with the surgery. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. A comprehensive blood panel and EKG… absolutely. I completely understand. It’s best to be thorough, and I trust your judgment completely. I’d feel much better knowing everything is alright before proceeding. Please, go ahead and schedule those tests for me. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to make sure I’m healthy enough, and I’m happy to do whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll go ahead and order those tests for you right now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in today. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and make a final decision about whether you're ready for surgery. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything very thoroughly, and you’ve put my mind at ease. I trust your expertise completely. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding, especially with my… forgetfulness. I suppose I'll go and get the blood tests done then. Thank you very much for your time, Doctor Auelua.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It was my pleasure. And please don't worry about the forgetfulness – we’ll take things at your pace. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Once you have the blood work done, please let us know, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And remember, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your care. Have a good day as well, Doctor Auelua.
