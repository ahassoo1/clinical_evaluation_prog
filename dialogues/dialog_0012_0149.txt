DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr… Yoshino, was it? Yes, well, it’s about this whole…fuss. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come. Something about not wanting…things done. I don’t rightly remember all the details. Honestly, at my age, things just…blur. It’s probably nothing serious. I’ve lived a long life, you know. A long life.
DOCTOR: It’s lovely to meet you too, Wynell. And please, call me Rudi. It sounds like you’ve certainly had a full one! Don’t worry about remembering everything – that’s what I’m here for. Your daughter sounds very caring. Could you tell me a little more about this “fuss”?
PATIENT: Oh, she is. A bit overbearing, if you ask me, but a good girl. This…fuss. Hmm. Well, the hospital, you see? They want to do…tests. And then…things. With tubes and…machines. I told them no. Point blank. I don’t need all that poking and prodding. I feel fine, mostly. A little ache here and there, but who doesn't at 83? It’s just…unnecessary bother, that’s what it is. I’ve seen what happens in hospitals. Not a pretty sight, believe me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the hospital's recommendations, and you're understandably hesitant about tests and procedures, especially after seeing what happens there. It's good you're advocating for yourself. Just to clarify, were these tests and procedures recommended after a specific event, like a fall or a sudden change in how you were feeling?
PATIENT: A fall? No, no falls. Nothing like that. It was…the regular check-up. You know, the one the insurance makes you do. That young man, the one with the stethoscope…he listened to my heart and then started talking about…numbers. Cholesterol, he called it. And something about my feet. Said they needed looking at. Honestly, I barely listened. Just told him I was fine and to send me on my way. That's when she got involved. My daughter. A whirlwind, that one. Now here I am. Frankly, I think everyone is making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this started at a routine check-up with your insurance. He mentioned some numbers – cholesterol, and something about your feet. And then your daughter stepped in. That helps me understand the situation better. Let's talk about those numbers, if you're up for it. Do you recall anything else he said about them?
PATIENT: Oh, numbers…ugh. Everything just blends together after a while. He said something about…high. My cholesterol was high. And…something about my feet being “at risk”. He kept using those medical words. Risk of what, I don’t know! I’ve been walking on these feet for eighty-three years, they've gotten me everywhere! A little bunion here and there, maybe, but nothing a good pair of shoes couldn't fix. He wanted to send me to a specialist. Like I'm broken or something! Honestly, I think he was just trying to drum up business.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Wynell. It can be frustrating when things aren't explained clearly, and it sounds like you felt rushed and perhaps a little dismissed. It’s good to question things, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel hesitant about seeing specialists if you're not sure why. Let’s try to break this down a little. High cholesterol can increase your risk of heart problems, but it’s something we can often manage with lifestyle changes or medication. And “at risk” with your feet... that could mean a few things – perhaps a risk of sores or infections, especially if circulation isn’t great. Before we talk about specialists, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Well…I suppose. But don’t go poking around too much. I’m a sensitive woman, you know. And honestly, I’ve had doctors before who just wanted to write prescriptions and send me on my way. I’m not interested in a quick look-see just to fill out paperwork. If you're going to examine me, I want you to listen to what I have to say, and explain things in plain English. No medical jargon! Can you promise me that, dear?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Wynell. I will listen to you, and I will explain everything in plain English. I’m not interested in rushing through an exam or just writing prescriptions. My goal is to understand what’s going on with you and to work with you to make a plan that you're comfortable with. Okay, let's start with your feet. Would you mind removing your shoes and socks so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. They’re old feet, you know. Seen better days. There. Happy now? A little cold, that’s all. And a bit dry. Florida weather, you know. Too much air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Wynell. Yes, I see a bit of dryness, and the skin is a little thin. The discoloration on your big toes... is that new, or has that been there for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, that? Hmm. Probably been there a while. I don’t rightly remember. Maybe a year? Two? I tend to ignore things like that. My mother always said to worry about the big things, not little spots. I suppose it got a little worse lately. Though, to be honest, everything feels worse lately. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know. It stings a little when I press on it. Not terribly, mind you, just…a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A little warmth and tenderness there. It could be a few things, Wynell. It’s good you mentioned the sting. We want to make sure it doesn’t get worse. Thin skin and poor circulation, especially with any sort of small injury, can sometimes lead to slow healing and…well, potential for infection. Now, let’s just listen to your heart. I’m going to put this stethoscope here, on your chest…
PATIENT: Oh, my heart. It's been beating for a long time, you know. A long, long time. I suppose it’s a little tired. Be gentle, dear. It skips a beat sometimes. Nothing serious, I don't think. Just…old age. My husband, bless his soul, he had a strong heart. Worked hard all his life. I never smoked, never drank much, so I figured I'd have a good one too. But you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: You're right, Wynell, a lifetime of beating deserves respect. I do hear a slight irregularity, and a very faint murmur. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s something we should investigate a little further. Many things can cause those sounds, and sometimes they're perfectly harmless. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Just some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and kidney function, and an EKG – that’s a simple test that records your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests…more tests. Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it. Blood work… I hate needles. And an…EKG? What does that even involve? Is it painful? Will it take all day? Look, I appreciate you listening, dear, I really do. But I’m not sure I want to put myself through all that bother. Maybe I'll just stick to taking it easy and hoping for the best. What's the point of finding out things are wrong if you can't fix them anyway? It just causes worry, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Wynell. It is exhausting, and the thought of more tests can be overwhelming. And you’re right, finding out something is wrong can be scary. But these tests aren’t necessarily about finding problems, they’re about getting information. Knowing your cholesterol levels helps us understand your risk of heart problems and whether we need to make any lifestyle changes or consider medication. And the EKG is completely painless – it just involves placing a few small stickers on your chest to record your heart’s rhythm. It takes about ten minutes. Think of it as gathering information so you can make informed decisions about your health. We don’t have to do anything we don’t want to do. If the tests show everything is fine, that’s great! And if they show something that needs attention, we can talk about all your options, and you can decide what’s best for you. Would you be willing to consider the tests, just so we have a clearer picture?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But only because you asked so nicely, dear. And if it involves a lot of poking and prodding, I'm walking out. And I want everything explained to me, in plain English, like you promised. No medical jargon, understand? And no pressure. If I don’t like what I hear, I'm not doing anything I don’t want to do. My daughter will be so relieved... she’s been nagging me about this for weeks. But you have to promise me, dear, you won't just try to sell me something I don't need. Can you promise me that?
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Wynell. No pressure, no jargon, and no selling anything you don't need. I will explain everything clearly, and we'll make decisions together. Your comfort and peace of mind are my top priority. Okay, let’s get these tests scheduled. We can do the blood work right here in the clinic, and the EKG can be done downstairs in the cardiology department. It shouldn't take too long. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the process and answer any questions you have. And don't worry, I’ll be right here if you need anything. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable right now?
PATIENT: Well…a glass of water would be nice. My mouth feels a little dry. And maybe just a few minutes to sit here and collect my thoughts. It’s all so much. This is going to be a long day, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It might be, but we’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll get the nurse with a glass of water right away. And please, take all the time you need to collect your thoughts. I'll be right outside if you need anything at all. Just let me know if you want me to come back in and chat before the nurse comes in. We can talk about anything you’d like.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you.
