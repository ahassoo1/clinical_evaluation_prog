DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Have a seat, have a seat. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes, thank you. Well, it’s… paperwork, mostly. My wife, she handles most things, you see. Something about needing papers for… time off? Or maybe… not working? It’s for that, I think. FMLA, maybe? She mentioned something like that. I’m a bit fuzzy on the details, honestly. It’s with the church, you see, and… well, it’s been a bit much lately.
DOCTOR: FMLA… right. So, you’re not experiencing any medical problems yourself, then?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Not exactly. Just… tired, maybe? Old age creeping in, you know? Nothing the paperwork won't fix. It's more for… well, I help out a lot with the religious education programs at the church, and I need to take some time. My wife says we need the right forms for that. She’s very organized, my wife. I don’t really keep track of these things. Do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, this is essentially a request for medical documentation to support leave from your… volunteer work. I see. And you say your wife mentioned FMLA?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! FMLA. Or maybe disability… she said something about both, I think. I just... I don't remember which one she said was the right fit. She does all the calling and… the understanding of those things. I mostly just do the work, you see? I run the programs, teach the classes… I'm not good with… official stuff. Is there a form for either one? Maybe we can fill out both, just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, with all due respect, FMLA is for employees taking leave from their jobs. Disability is for individuals unable to work due to a medical condition. You’ve stated you're volunteering with the church. Neither of those typically apply. What exactly are you hoping this documentation will do for you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that… doesn't sound right. My wife said something about needing proof of… needing to rest. She said the church might need it, to… cover things while I'm not able to do as much. They're very strict about these things, you see. And she said something about benefits, maybe? I don't know… I really just want to be able to take a step back for a bit without… causing problems. Is there anything we can fill out? Even if it's not FMLA or disability? She's very worried about getting everything right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to clarify. You're seeking documentation to allow you to reduce your volunteer workload at the church due to… fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes! Fatigue, that's it. Just… tired. And a little achy, sometimes. Nothing serious, mind you. But running those programs is a lot of work, especially with the younger children. And my wife, she worries. She says the church has a… policy, and needs something on file. Maybe a letter? Saying I need to take it easy? Would a letter work? She really stressed the importance of having everything official.
DOCTOR: A letter stating you are experiencing fatigue and requesting a reduction in your volunteer hours. Very well. We can do that. But frankly, Mr. Limtiaco, this is not a medical necessity. This is… a request for accommodation. And it's not something I routinely provide documentation for. However, to be thorough, and to appease your wife, I will ask a few questions to ensure there isn't something more serious underlying this fatigue. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that's very kind of you. Yes, my wife will be so pleased. She's a very practical woman. Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I get a little… dizzy when I stand up too quickly. And my memory hasn't been the best lately, as I mentioned. But that’s probably just old age, you know? And… oh! My wife says I've been more irritable than usual. But she says that’s just because I’m tired. I mostly just feel… worn out. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I don't usually think about these things.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, memory issues, irritability… Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite hasn't been great, to be honest. I haven't been eating as much as usual. And… I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. My wife keeps trying to get me to eat more, but I just don’t feel very hungry. It’s not a lot, mind you, but I can feel my clothes are a little looser. She weighed me last week, I think, but I don’t remember the exact number. She’s the one who keeps track of all that, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, while you describe this as simply fatigue, these other symptoms – the weight loss, dizziness, memory changes, decreased appetite – are concerning. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes before simply attributing this to aging or overwork. I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to be safe. We should also check your blood pressure. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work? Is… is something seriously wrong? My wife didn’t say anything about blood work. I just wanted a letter! But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, of course. If it will help… I suppose it's best to be sure. I trust your judgment. But please, don't worry my wife too much. She gets very anxious. Okay, blood work. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll do a quick blood draw in the lab just down the hall. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, so no breakfast this morning, or anything to drink except water. We'll also check your blood pressure here in the office, and I'll perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Just relax, and I'll get started with that now. Please, don't worry too much. It's better to be cautious. We’ll have the results back in a few days.
PATIENT: Okay. No breakfast… right. And water only. I can do that. I hope everything is alright. My wife… she'll be very concerned if anything is wrong. She's a very practical woman, but she worries a lot. Just… please, let it be nothing serious.
DOCTOR: 138/82. Not terrible, but a bit elevated. I'm also going to listen to your lungs and check your reflexes. This is just a standard part of the assessment. Breathe deeply, if you would.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I don't usually go to the doctor, so I’m a little nervous. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you think I should be worried about anything. My wife is going to want to know everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems within normal limits, but, as I mentioned earlier, your blood pressure is a little elevated. And your weight loss is concerning. We need to get the blood work results to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order the blood work now. The lab technician will explain the process. Once we have those results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to get some rest, stay hydrated, and focus on eating small, nutritious meals, even if you don’t feel hungry.
PATIENT: Okay. Rest, hydrated… small meals. I can try. My wife will be glad to hear I'm trying. When will I hear about the blood work? And… what if something is wrong? I hope it’s nothing serious. I just wanted a letter for the church.
DOCTOR: The results should be back in approximately three to five business days. The lab will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. Mr. Limtiaco, I understand you were hoping for a simple letter. However, it’s my responsibility to ensure your health and well-being. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and determine the best course of action. It's likely to be nothing serious, but we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’ll also write a letter stating you are experiencing fatigue and requesting a reduction in your volunteer hours, as you originally requested. But, please, prioritize your health. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I suppose not. Just… please, tell my wife everything, if you find something wrong. She worries a lot, and she’ll want to know. And thank you. Thank you for ordering the blood work, and for writing the letter. I guess I’ll just… wait for the lab to call. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Limtiaco. And don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. .
