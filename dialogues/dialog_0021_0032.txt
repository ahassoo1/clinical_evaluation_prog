DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes. It’s… a delicate matter. Something of an embarrassment, really. An older gentleman shouldn’t have to be bothered with such things. But, there’s been… a discharge. A bit… unpleasant. I haven’t the faintest idea what’s caused it, and frankly, I’d rather not dwell on the possibilities.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Goodness. That’s… difficult to say precisely. A week? Perhaps a little longer. Time does seem to… slip away these days. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. A gradual thing. I didn't think much of it at first, naturally. One assumes these things resolve themselves. But it persists. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so. And can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Oh dear. It’s… well, it’s not water, certainly. Nor is it… solid. A sort of… milky substance, I suppose. Not a great quantity, thankfully. But noticeable. And… rather odorous, if I may be frank. It stains the undergarments, naturally. A most unpleasant situation. I’ve always prided myself on my… cleanliness.
DOCTOR: Right. Milky, odorous… and staining your undergarments. Okay. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no, not precisely pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A tickle, really. And no burning. Itching… sometimes, yes. But nothing debilitating. It's more the… indignity of the whole affair. A man of my age shouldn't be concerned with such trivialities. My wife, bless her soul, keeps offering creams, but I haven't the patience for such things. It’s probably just… a temporary ailment. A passing phase. I’m not one for fussing, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, slight discomfort, occasional itching. And you haven’t tried any creams or anything?
PATIENT: Creams? Good heavens, no! I am a practical man, Doctor. A farm equipment mechanic, remember? I deal with grease and metal, not lotions and potions. My wife, she’s a good woman, always fussing. She offered something with… chamomile, I believe. But I politely declined. I prefer to let things… resolve themselves naturally. Interfering only makes matters worse, in my experience. Though, clearly, it hasn’t resolved itself. That's why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any fever, chills, or any changes in your urination – like more frequent trips to the bathroom, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't believe so. I haven’t taken my temperature, mind you, but I haven't felt particularly warm. Chills… no, it’s been quite warm lately, actually. As for urination… well, perhaps a little more frequent, now that you mention it. But I've always enjoyed a good cup of tea. Naturally, that leads to… increased activity. I wouldn't say it's difficult, no. Just… more of it. It’s all rather inconvenient, really. And undignified. Is this going to require… tests? I sincerely hope not.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no chills, slightly more frequent urination. Alright. Well, Mr. Krok, given your age and these symptoms, we really should rule out a few things. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I’m going to order a urine sample for analysis. It’s standard procedure, and it will help us determine the cause of the discharge and get you feeling better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? And a urine sample? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here for a simple consultation, not an… invasion of privacy. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m quite capable of assessing my own condition. Is this truly necessary? Couldn’t we simply try… something else? A strong tea, perhaps? Or a… topical ointment? This seems rather… excessive. And frankly, a little insulting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your reluctance, but it's my professional responsibility to ensure we have a clear understanding of what’s going on. These symptoms could be caused by a number of things, some of which are quite easily treated, others… less so. A simple exam and urine sample will help us rule out anything serious. It’s standard practice, and it’s the best way to provide you with the appropriate care. We're not guessing here. We need information. It’s not about insulting you, it's about being thorough. Would you prefer I refer you to another doctor?
PATIENT: Refer me to another doctor? Absolutely not. I’ve waited weeks for this appointment, and I’d rather not start the process all over again. Fine. Very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. But I expect the utmost discretion, Doctor. And I trust you’ll be as… swift as possible. I haven’t the patience for prolonged examinations. Just get it over with, please. And explain everything clearly afterwards. I’m a practical man, remember? I need facts, not… speculation. Though, I still maintain this is all rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. If you could just lie down on the examination table, we'll start with a quick abdominal exam, and then I’ll need a urine sample. I'll explain everything as we go. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: This is… most undignified. I trust this table is clean? And please, Doctor, be gentle. I haven’t the constitution for rough handling. A man of my age, you understand. Proceed, then. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as you can. I’m just checking for any tenderness or swelling. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to need a urine sample. I’ll leave you some privacy to collect that. There's a specimen cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. I'll be right outside when you're finished.
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample? Good heavens. This is becoming increasingly… complicated. Very well. Just… give me a moment. I trust the bathroom is adequately equipped? And please, Doctor, try to avoid any unnecessary… inquiries. A man’s privacy, you understand. Hurry up and wait, I suppose.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: There. I believe that's everything. A most… unpleasant experience. And I trust you’ll handle it with the utmost discretion? I’d prefer not to discuss the details any further. Now, what? Are we finished? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Krok. We'll send this off to the lab for analysis. It should take a couple of days to get the results. While we’re waiting, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. It’s standard procedure. Could you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be quick about it. And try not to… poke and prod too much. A man of my age isn’t accustomed to such… examinations. Get on with it, then. This is all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, and avoiding any caffeine or alcohol. Also, try to avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Increase my fluid intake? Avoid caffeine? Avoid strenuous activity? Doctor, are you suggesting I live in a bubble? I’ve been a farm equipment mechanic for sixty years! Strenuous activity is my life! And as for caffeine… a good cup of tea is essential for a productive day. Questions? No. I have a distinct feeling I’m being subjected to a series of… unnecessary restrictions. This is all rather… disheartening. When can I expect these “results”? And will they require further… examinations? I sincerely hope not.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back in two to three business days. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. If the results indicate anything concerning, we may need to discuss further testing. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, just try to follow my recommendations as best you can. It’s all about minimizing irritation and promoting healing. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. I’ve wasted enough time here already. Just… call me when the results are back. And please, ensure my privacy is respected. This entire experience has been… most unpleasant. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day as well, Mr. Krok. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. .
