DOCTOR: Welcome to the clinic, Criston. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, it's my water. It's...orange. Like, when I pee, it's orange color. Not normal, yeah?
DOCTOR: No, that's not typically normal. Orange-colored urine can be caused by a number of things, so let's try to figure out what’s going on with you. To start, has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: It's new. Maybe...three days? I noticed it after I did some work outside. It was very hot, I was sweating a lot. Before that, everything was fine. Normal color, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, three days, and you noticed it after some strenuous work outdoors in the heat. That's helpful. Were you able to drink a lot of fluids while you were working, or were you perhaps a little dehydrated?
PATIENT: I think...not enough. I had some water, but it was very hot, and I was busy. Maybe not enough water, yeah? I didn't really think about it too much at the time. Just trying to finish the job. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to get caught up in work. Dehydration can certainly cause changes in urine color, so that's a good place to start. It often leads to more concentrated urine, which can appear darker, sometimes even orange. But let’s rule out other possibilities just to be sure. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. Just…the color. It’s a little scary, I guess? My wife told me to come see you. She worries a lot. Everything else feels normal. No fever, no hurt, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good – no pain, no fever, everything else feeling normal is reassuring. Your wife is right to be cautious, though. We always want to investigate something like a change in urine color. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel…you mean, like, poop? Uh, no, nothing different there. Everything is…normal, I think? Sorry, I don't understand why you ask about that.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Criston. It’s perfectly fine to ask questions. I ask about bowel movements because sometimes changes in urine color can be related to liver function, and those changes can also affect stool color. But if everything is normal there, that’s good. Do you have any history of liver problems, or have you ever had jaundice – that's a yellowing of the skin or eyes?
PATIENT: No, no liver problems. My wife always tells me to eat healthy, so I try. And no…yellow eyes, or skin. Everything is…my normal color. I haven't been sick with anything serious, ever. Just little colds, sometimes. I don't think I've ever had jaundice. What is that exactly?
DOCTOR: Jaundice is when your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It happens when there's a buildup of a substance called bilirubin in your blood, often because of a problem with the liver. But it sounds like that's not happening with you, which is good. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Just…sometimes, I take something for a headache. Ibuprofen, maybe? When it’s really bad. But I don't take it often. My wife buys it, but I don’t use it much. Everything else…no. Just water. And food.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches, that’s good to know. Sometimes, certain medications can cause changes in urine color, so it’s helpful to rule those out. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. That’s just standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's fine. I trust you, Doctor. Just…quick, please? I have work later. Not important, but…I need to finish some things. What will you do?
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as quick as possible. It shouldn’t take long. First, I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything feels normal here. I don't feel any obvious abnormalities. Given your symptoms—orange urine after strenuous work, no pain, no fever, clear lungs, soft abdomen—the most likely cause is dehydration. It's likely that your kidneys are concentrating your urine because you weren't drinking enough fluids. However, to be completely sure, I'd like to order a urinalysis. That's a simple test that can check for things like infection, blood, and other substances in your urine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Urinalysis sounds…good. To be sure is good. I don't want anything serious, you know? Can I still go to work after? My boss is already mad I came here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A urinalysis is a very simple test and shouldn’t interfere with your ability to work. We’ll just collect a sample, and it will take a few minutes to get the results. I'll have the nurse show you to the restroom to collect a sample. After that, we can discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any questions before you head off to collect the sample?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just pee in a cup, yeah? Not a problem. Thank you, Doctor. You are very…nice. I was worried before, but I feel better now. .
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just a simple sample. I’m glad I could reassure you, Criston. We’ll get everything sorted out. I’ll be right here when you get back. .
