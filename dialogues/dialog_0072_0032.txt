DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 83 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Eighty-three, yes… a rather long time, wouldn’t you agree? Well, to put it bluntly… there’s been a… discharge. An unpleasant matter, really. I haven't experienced anything like this before, and my wife insisted I come see someone about it. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: "Bothersome," you say. Alright. Could you be more specific about this discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, it’s… it’s coming from… down there. A bit of fluid, you understand. Not a great deal, but enough to be… noticeable. A yellowish colour, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It started… oh, goodness, perhaps a week ago? Or was it two? Time simply slips away, you know. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: A yellowish discharge for approximately one to two weeks. And you say it's not associated with any pain?
PATIENT: Precisely. No pain. No burning. No itching. Just… a discharge. I’ve always been a… particular man. Very clean, you see. And this is… decidedly not clean. It's quite unsettling. I've never needed to discuss such things with a doctor before. My wife, bless her heart, is terribly worried, but frankly, I find this entire situation… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. It's never easy discussing these types of issues. Now, to get a better understanding, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I recall. I’ve taken a few things over the years, for aches and pains, mostly. A bit of aspirin here and there. Nothing… dramatic. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. Didn’t require much in the way of medication. My wife handles most of that now, anyway. Perhaps you should ask her. She’s got a remarkable memory for these sorts of things. Though she does tend to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter? Goodness, no. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. Fresh air, good food, a bit of gardening. That’s what keeps a man going. My wife… she takes something for her blood pressure, I think. And something else for her joints. But I don’t require all these… potions and pills. I prefer to rely on natural remedies. Though they haven't been particularly effective in this instance, have they?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Krok, I'm going to need to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, prostate issues perhaps?
PATIENT: Prostate issues? Now there's a delicate subject. I suppose… well, when one reaches a certain age, certain things become… common. I believe the doctor back in… Shiraz, was it?… mentioned something about an enlarged prostate some years ago. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… a normal part of aging, he said. I don’t recall any other diagnoses. I’ve been fortunate, you see. Generally very healthy. I avoid doctors whenever possible. They always seem to find something wrong.
DOCTOR: An enlarged prostate diagnosed some years ago. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Years ago, when I was still living in Iran, I had my appendix removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… I believe I had a minor operation on my knee, a long time ago. A sports injury, if you can call it that. I was quite the footballer in my youth. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing major. It’s all rather hazy, you understand. So much time has passed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your relatives – your parents, siblings – had any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, that was generations ago! My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. My siblings… well, I had a brother, but we lost contact after I left Iran. And several sisters. I barely remember them. Everyone had… what do you call it?… the usual things. Old age, mostly. A bit of heart trouble here and there, I suppose. Nothing remarkable. Frankly, I don't keep track of such things. It’s all rather irrelevant, isn't it? I am concerned about my condition, not the ailments of distant relatives.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I have always considered smoking to be a rather vulgar habit. A terrible thing for the lungs, you see. I've always been very careful about my health. My wife, now she used to dabble when we first met, a silly habit she thankfully abandoned years ago. But I have never touched the stuff. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol consumption, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a small brandy on special occasions. Nothing excessive, mind you. I wouldn't say I drink, precisely. It's more of a… cultural thing, you understand. A bit of relaxation. But I certainly don't indulge regularly. And certainly not enough to cause any problems. My wife enjoys a little sherry from time to time, as well. But again, everything in moderation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, I need to perform a physical examination. This will help me assess your condition more accurately. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Doctor, must we? It's rather… undignified, you know. I’ve already explained my discomfort. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. Just be quick about it, if you would. And please, be gentle. I am a man of a certain age, after all. I trust you have some… discretion?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as efficient and discreet as possible. Please lie back on the examination table when you are ready. We’ll start with your abdomen, then move on to a genital examination. I need to examine the source of the discharge, and that will require a brief visual inspection and palpation. Is that understood?
PATIENT: A… a genital examination? Doctor, are you quite sure this is necessary? I mean, couldn't we simply prescribe something? An antibiotic, perhaps? I really don’t see the need for all this… probing. It's utterly humiliating. But… if you insist. Just… please be as swift and unobtrusive as possible. And try not to look so… clinical. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your discomfort, but a proper examination is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Without it, I could be prescribing medication unnecessarily, or worse, missing a more serious underlying condition. I assure you, I will maintain the utmost professionalism and discretion. Please turn over onto your left side. I will begin with auscultation of your abdomen to listen for any abnormalities, then palpate to check for tenderness or masses. After that, we'll proceed with the examination as quickly and respectfully as possible. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point.
