DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me in your own words what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. It’s… well, it’s rather difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the restroom quite often. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a few weeks, I believe? Honestly, the details are a bit hazy. I just know it's disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive how, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: Well, disruptive to… my routine, primarily. I find myself needing to plan my day around it, if you understand. It interferes with… activities. I used to enjoy longer drives, for example, but now… well, it's less appealing. And at night, I… wake up. Several times, I think. To use the facilities. It's rather… inconvenient. I apologize for being so vague; it's simply hard to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased frequency of urination, both during the day and at night. And it's impacting your daily activities. When you say “more than usual,” can you give me a rough estimate of how often you're urinating now compared to, say, six months ago?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. Six months ago… I was likely… less preoccupied with it. I suppose… then it was perhaps… four or five times a day? Now… I’d venture to say closer to… eight or nine, perhaps more. It fluctuates. And at night… then it was maybe once, occasionally none. Now… two, sometimes three times. I truly apologize for not being more precise. My memory… isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verbose. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you experience any pain or burning while urinating?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain or burning, no. It’s… just the volume, and the frequency. It’s rather… unremarkable in that sense. It simply… happens. Often. I should add, the flow itself seems normal, as far as I can tell. Not weak, not strained. Just… plentiful. And frequent. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. And are you noticing any changes in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I believe it might be a bit darker than usual. Perhaps a straw color, rather than clear. Though it’s difficult to be certain; I don’t spend a great deal of time analyzing it, to be frank. The odor… I haven’t detected anything unusual. It smells… like urine, I suppose. I apologize for my lack of observation; I’m not a medical professional.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Verbose. It’s my job to ask these questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this increased urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. No, not that I'm aware of. No fever, no chills, no nausea. No weight loss, certainly. My appetite is… normal, I think. No excessive thirst, though I may be drinking a little more water, now that I think about it. Probably just to compensate for… everything else. No swelling in my legs or ankles. I'm trying to recall anything… anything at all… but no, I can't think of anything else significant. I do feel… a bit more tired lately, but that could simply be… age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: That's… a rather broad question, Doctor. Let me see. I believe I had… influenza, perhaps ten years ago? Nothing serious, thankfully. I’ve always been… quite healthy, all things considered. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries. I take a mild blood pressure medication, but that’s all. And… oh, yes. I had my appendix removed in my youth, but that was decades ago. I believe that's all. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. My memory… it's truly frustrating. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Your Medicare information is noted. And your blood pressure medication… what is the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Let me see if I can recall... It's… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, taken daily. Though I must confess, I rarely think about the dosage. My physician simply renews the prescription automatically each month. I apologize for not being more informed. It’s just… I trust my doctor to manage these things. Perhaps I should be more diligent.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. No food allergies, no drug allergies, no environmental allergies. I used to… spend a great deal of time outdoors, and I never encountered any problems. I believe my wife… she would have remembered if I had any allergies. She was always very attentive to such things. But no, I don’t believe I have any.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Verbose, based on what you've told me, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your frequent urination without further investigation. It could be a number of things, ranging from a simple urinary tract infection to something more complex. To start, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam and order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and some tests… certainly. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed at your own pace. I apologize for not being a more… cooperative patient. It’s just this… forgetfulness. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow me to the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Lead the way. I hope I don't present too much of a challenge. I do have… somewhat sensitive skin. But please, do not hesitate to proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142 over 88. Nothing overly concerning at the moment, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, if you'll just lie down on the examination table, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. A slight… pressure, perhaps, but nothing alarming. It’s… difficult to distinguish between normal sensations and… discomfort. I apologize if I'm being unhelpful. I do have a… rather sensitive constitution. But no, I don't believe there is any pain. It feels… as it usually does.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything feels… normal to the touch, though I do detect some mild fullness. Now, I'm just going to perform a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! A little… startling, Doctor. But yes, I believe I felt… a response. It was… somewhat diminished, perhaps? I am not certain. I haven’t had a reflex test in… quite some time. It’s difficult to say what is normal and what is not.
DOCTOR: Yes, your reflexes are somewhat diminished. This could be age-related, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment, I need to collect a urine sample. I'll leave you some privacy. There’s a container in the restroom. Please try to collect a midstream sample.
PATIENT: A midstream sample, you say? Yes, of course. I believe I remember… vaguely. I will do my best to comply. A diminished reflex… that doesn't sound promising. I will be as… expeditious as possible.
