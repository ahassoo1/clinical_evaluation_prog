DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a rather delicate matter, to be frank. And frankly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My wife, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… a bit of discharge. I haven't the foggiest idea what that even means, but she was quite insistent. It’s… embarrassing, naturally. A man of my age…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It's very common for men to experience changes as they get older, and there's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. Many things can cause discharge, and most are easily treatable. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in – it's always best to get these things checked out. When you say discharge, could you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Well, it’s… damp. That’s the best way to put it. A bit of dampness. And… yellowish, I suppose. Not a great deal of it, mind you. More… a nuisance, really. And it smells… not pleasant. I haven't been able to pinpoint exactly what it smells like, but it’s not roses, that much I can assure you. I do apologize for the graphic details, Doctor. It’s simply… unpleasant to discuss.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all graphic, Mr. Krok, and you have no need to apologize. It's helpful for me to understand exactly what's going on, and you're being very clear. Yellowish discharge, with an odor… okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me see… goodness. My wife mentioned it a week ago, perhaps? Or was it two? Time seems to… slip away these days. I’ve been feeling quite well otherwise, you understand. No pain, no burning, just… the dampness. It’s been gradual, I think. Not sudden. I’m fairly certain it wasn’t there a month ago. Though, to be honest, I don’t spend a great deal of time… inspecting myself, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. And that's perfectly understandable. So, approximately a week or two – gradual onset, no other symptoms like pain or burning. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination…? No, not that I’m aware of. Everything seems… normal down there, as it were. The stream is as strong as ever, I suppose. No difficulty, no burning sensation, nothing like that. Though, I must admit, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps I have noticed something and simply forgotten. My wife would likely know better. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krok. It's helpful that you haven't noticed any changes with urination. Now, have you had any fevers, chills, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Perfectly fine, as I said. No fever, no chills, no aches or pains. Just… this dampness. It’s a minor irritation, truly. I'm a robust man, Doctor, despite my age. I've lived a full life, worked hard on the farm my entire life. A little discharge isn't going to bring me down. Though, my wife is terribly worried. She always is. She thinks the worst of everything.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me all of this, Mr. Krok. It’s good to know you’re feeling generally well. It's wonderful that you’ve lived such a full life working on the farm. It’s also very good of your wife to be proactive about your health. Now, just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Really? Is that necessary? I've been a married man for… well, for a very long time. A very long time. And a faithful one, I might add. Such questions are… quite impertinent. I find it rather… vulgar, to be frank. I can assure you, I have no history of… that sort of thing. It's simply not done. And I would appreciate it if you refrained from asking such indelicate questions in the future.
DOCTOR: Oh, Mr. Krok, I am so sorry. That was entirely inappropriate of me, and I deeply apologize. It was a standard question, but that doesn’t excuse my lack of sensitivity. Please accept my sincerest apologies. We absolutely don't need to discuss that any further. Let's move on. Have you had any prostate problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… prostate problems. Now, there was something my doctor back in… well, back in Shiraz mentioned, many years ago. Something about an enlarged prostate. He suggested… well, I don’t recall exactly what he suggested. Some sort of medication, perhaps? I didn't pay much attention, to be honest. It didn't bother me at the time. Just a bit of difficulty… emptying my bladder occasionally. It wasn't serious. I’ve been managing it for years. I suppose that’s what he was talking about. It hasn’t bothered me much lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. An enlarged prostate mentioned years ago, with some occasional difficulty emptying your bladder. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and a gentle exam of your lower abdomen and groin area. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Now, see, that’s what I was afraid of. I'm not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, if I'm honest. I'm an old man, Doctor. My body is… well, it’s been through a lot. And I'm not comfortable with strangers examining my… private areas. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't you just… prescribe something? Perhaps an ointment? My wife has all sorts of creams and lotions. Surely one of them would do the trick. I really don't relish the thought of being… examined.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance completely, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The exam is important to help me determine the cause of the discharge and ensure I’m prescribing the right treatment. It will be a very quick and gentle exam, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I can also have a male nurse present during the exam, if that would make you more comfortable. If we skip the exam, I wouldn't be able to rule out other potential causes, and we might end up treating the wrong thing. However, if you are absolutely opposed to the exam, we can try a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a first step. But I strongly recommend the exam if possible. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Broad-spectrum antibiotic… My wife would likely insist on that. She's always more cautious than I am. It’s just… the thought of being prodded and poked… It’s undignified. Very undignified. And I'm not getting any younger, you know. Very well. If you insist it’s absolutely necessary… then I suppose I can endure it. But be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And please, explain everything as you go. I don't want any surprises. And no male nurse, thank you. That would be… even more embarrassing. Just you. And be quick about it. I have a garden to tend to, you know. Tomatoes don’t pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and quick as possible, and I'll explain everything thoroughly as I go. No surprises, I promise. And absolutely no male nurse. Let's proceed at your pace, and if you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. First, let me listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back for me, please. And then I’ll need to gently palpate your lower abdomen and groin area. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with, then. But be careful, Doctor. Very careful. My ribs are rather… fragile these days. And don’t expect me to tell you if it hurts. I'm a stoic man, you know. I've endured far worse than a little prodding. Just… hurry up. The tomatoes are waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Breathing sounds are clear, no unusual noises detected. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just tell me if you feel any tenderness or pain. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little. Just a little. It's… uncomfortable. That's all. Don't press so hard, Doctor. You're making it worse. And please, stop talking so much. It's distracting. Just get on with it. The tomatoes, you know. They need my attention. And my wife would have my hide if I let them wither.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm being very gentle, and I apologize if I'm causing any discomfort. No obvious masses detected on either side. Now, just a quick check of your groin… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! That’s… quite unnecessary. Are you certain you need to… poke around there? It’s rather… personal. I'm an old man, as I've said. I don’t need you examining my… private bits. Just skip that part, please. It's making me very uncomfortable. And the tomatoes… they’re probably starting to rot as we speak. Just finish up, Doctor. Please. Just finish up.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry, Mr. Krok. You are absolutely right. That was entirely inappropriate of me. I should have been more sensitive to your discomfort. We will skip that part entirely. I apologize for causing you any distress. Alright, Mr. Krok. Based on the brief examination, and given your discomfort, I suspect it may be a mild urinary tract infection or possibly a localized irritation. However, without a more complete examination, it’s difficult to say for certain. I'll write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic, as you requested. It should help clear up any infection. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Thank goodness. A prescription will be fine. Yes, a prescription is perfectly fine. No allergies, thankfully. Though, my wife does insist I take a daily vitamin. Something about boosting my immune system. She's always worrying about something. But no, no allergies. Just… let's get this over with, Doctor. I need to get back to my garden. And hopefully, the tomatoes haven't completely succumbed to rot. This has been… a rather unpleasant experience, to be frank. But thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. I apologize again for the unpleasantness, and I’m glad we could come to a solution that you’re comfortable with. I’ll print the prescription for you now. This is for a 7-day course of Ciprofloxacin, take one tablet twice a day with food. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. Also, if your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they get worse, please come back and see me, or see another doctor. And if you develop any fever, chills, or pain in your back, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Ciprofloxacin… Sounds… potent. I suppose. No, I don’t think so. No questions. Just… finish the course, you say? And come back if it gets worse? Yes, I understand. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Not one for complicated instructions. Just take the pills, finish the course, and hope for the best. Thank you, Doctor. And good day to you. I really must be going. The tomatoes are calling. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. You take care of yourself, and enjoy your tomatoes. I hope they’re still salvageable! And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day.
