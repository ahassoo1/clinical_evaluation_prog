DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh… good mornin’. Doc, right? Listen, it’s… somethin’ down there. It’s… leakin’. Not good. Been happenin’ a little bit, but now it’s… wetter. I don't know what to do about it. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, “down there”… I understand. It sounds concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Ms. Genard. We see all sorts of things here. When you say “leakin’,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it's kinda… slimy. Not blood, thank goodness. Just… stuff. Comes out when I… you know… when I use the bathroom. And sometimes just… when I walk around. It’s not a lot, but enough to… bother me. I gotta change my underwear more often, that’s for sure. It smells funny too, kinda like… old fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, "slimy," not blood, that’s good to know. And it happens both when you use the bathroom and sometimes just generally… and you mentioned a smell. "Old fish," you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, old fish. It's not… perfume, that’s for sure. My mama woulda tanned my hide if I smelled like this. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, I dunno. A week? Maybe two. I lose track. I been busy paintin’, you see. Got a show comin’ up.
DOCTOR: A week or two… and you’re busy preparing for a show. That’s wonderful! It’s good to stay active. Now, Ms. Genard, has anything changed with your bathroom habits lately?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? You mean… goin’ more often? Maybe. I dunno. Like I said, I been busy. I drink my coffee, go when I gotta go. It's just… this leakin’ is new. Never had this happen before. And it's not like I'm drinkin’ any more water, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: No, I just wanted to rule things out. You haven't noticed any pain or burning when you use the bathroom?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. A little uncomfortable sometimes, but I’m old. Things ache, you know? It’s just… this wetness. It’s kinda… unnervin’. Makes me feel… dirty.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Genard. It’s good you’re telling me how you feel. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. It’ll help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh, goodness. What kinda exam? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. I’m a lady, Doc.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. It’s a very routine exam, just a quick look to see what might be causing the issue. It involves looking at the external area, and I may need to do a gentle internal exam, but I’ll explain everything fully before we do anything. We want to be as comfortable as possible. It’s about finding out what’s going on, and we can stop at any time. Would you like me to explain the internal part in more detail?
PATIENT: Internal? Oh, no thank you. Absolutely not. I don't want nobody pokin’ around down there. Just look at the outside. That’s all. I ain’t comfortable with any of that other stuff. You hear me?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, I hear you perfectly. We will absolutely respect your wishes. We can proceed with an external exam only. It may make it a little harder to pinpoint the exact cause, but we can still gather some information. Would you mind if I ask about your medical history while we’re at it?
PATIENT: Medical history? Lord. What do you want to know? I'm old! I been to the doctor a million times. Probably got all kinds of things wrong with me I don't even know about. I mostly just take somethin’ for my arthritis. And a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but it's nothin’ serious. Never been married, never had kids. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Arthritis and blood pressure… and no surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Had the measles when I was little, but that's it. And the flu sometimes. But nothin’ serious. I'm a strong Chamorro woman! We don't get sick easy. Mostly just aches and pains from paintin’ all day. That's my biggest problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Genard. You sound very resilient. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I can eat anything. I like spicy food, but that's different. I don't take much medicine anyway. Just the stuff I told ya. A little somethin’ for the arthritis. And sometimes a headache pill. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Now, would you mind if I take a quick look at the area you mentioned?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But be gentle! And don’t you go pokin’ around. Just look. That's all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. Just a quick look. Please lie down on the examination table when you're ready. Alright, Ms. Genard. I see some mild redness and a little discharge. It doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning, but I do think it's worth investigating further. I recommend a simple urine test to rule out an infection. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Urine test? Oh, goodness. More tests. I just wanna know what's leakin’, Doc. Is it serious? Am I gonna die? I got a show, you know! I can't be sick!
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, you are not going to die. It's very unlikely to be anything that serious. A urine test is a simple way to check for an infection, which is a common cause of discharge. It's a quick and easy procedure. If it's an infection, we can treat it with antibiotics, and you should be feeling much better in no time. However, if the urine test comes back clear, we may need to consider other possibilities, such as a mild skin irritation or something else. In that case, I'd recommend seeing a gynecologist for a more thorough evaluation. Would you be open to that if needed?
PATIENT: Gynecologist?! Oh, no. Absolutely not. I told you, I don't want nobody pokin’ around down there. I’ll just deal with the leakin’. I got a show to prepare for! You think I got time for all these tests and doctors? No, thank you. Just tell me if it’s serious or not. And if I need to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. I understand. While I strongly recommend following up with a specialist, I respect your decision. Based on what I've seen today, it doesn't seem immediately dangerous. It's likely a minor irritation or possibly a mild infection. I’m going to recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear. If you notice any fever, pain, or the discharge gets significantly worse, please seek medical attention immediately. I'll write a note for you outlining these recommendations. And, if you change your mind about the specialist referral, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I just wanna get outta here. Thanks, Doc. I guess. Try not to worry me too much. I got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I understand completely. I’ll have the nurse print out those instructions for you. And please, take care of yourself. And best of luck with your show! Don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
