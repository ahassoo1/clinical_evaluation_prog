DOCTOR: Right, Jinnie Wartick. 57 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s rather embarrassing, to be honest. But I suppose that's why one comes to the doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a problem. A male problem. For… someone else. A friend, you see. He’s… discharging. Something is… coming out. And it’s not… normal.
DOCTOR: A…friend. Right. And you’re here discussing his…discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, well, he’s rather… shy. And a bit of a mess, truthfully. Doesn’t want to come himself. I thought, as a concerned friend, I could… explain. It’s been going on for a little while now, and frankly, it doesn’t look right. It’s… yellowish, if that makes sense. And a bit smelly, I’m afraid. Not a pleasant odour at all.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge… from a male…friend. And you say it’s been going on for “a little while.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… well, let me think. He didn’t say exactly… but I’d say at least a week. Perhaps two? He’s not very forthcoming with details, you see. He just kept saying “it’s bothering me.” Honestly, men are so ridiculous. He likely waited too long to say anything at all. It's probably nothing, though. Probably just… irritated. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: “Irritated” can mean many things. And a week or two is…significant enough to warrant attention. Does he have any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. He didn't mention pain. He did say it was… uncomfortable. And he’s been going to the bathroom more often, I believe. But I don’t know if that’s…related. He's a bit vague, as I said. He mostly just complains and expects me to sort everything out for him. It’s always something. Really, Doctor, is it possible it’s just… a bit of dryness? Or something he can put a cream on?
DOCTOR: Frequent urination with discharge… This isn’t sounding like simple dryness. Does he have any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Fever? No, not that I know of. He hasn't said anything about a fever. And chills… no. He's been a bit listless, perhaps. But he’s always a bit…melodramatic. As for abdominal pain… I suppose he’s complained of feeling generally unwell, but not specifically pain. It's hard to tell with him. He exaggerates everything. He probably just ate something bad. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think he's making a fuss over nothing. Is it really necessary to do a lot of tests?
DOCTOR: Well, given the duration and your description, we need to rule out a few things. We’ll need a urine sample, and I'm going to need to examine him. I understand he’s… reluctant, but delaying could make things more complicated.
PATIENT: Examine him? Oh, really. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just… prescribe something? An antibiotic, perhaps? He hates doctors, you see. It will be a dreadful ordeal to get him to come in here. And frankly, I’m not entirely sure I approve of him… being poked and prodded. It feels rather… intrusive. Are you certain it’s necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary. I am a physician, and I need to properly assess the situation to provide appropriate care. I cannot prescribe medication without a diagnosis. This is not a request; it's standard medical procedure. If he refuses an examination, I will not be able to help him. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… rather blunt, isn’t it? I suppose… I suppose I can try to convince him. But honestly, Doctor, you’re not making this easy. He’s a very sensitive man. And I’m not sure he’ll appreciate being… lectured. I’ll tell him what you said, but I can’t promise anything. Really, is there nothing else you can do? Perhaps just a strong antibiotic, just in case?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m documenting that you’ve requested medication without a proper examination. I’m not comfortable with that. Tell your friend he needs to be seen. And frankly, his reluctance is concerning. I’m going to schedule an appointment for him tomorrow morning. 9:00 AM. Take it or leave it. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are we finished?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… 9:00 AM. Oh, goodness. He’ll be furious. But… I suppose it’s better than nothing. Very well, Doctor. 9:00 AM it is. I’ll…try to prepare him. I really don't know how I'll manage this, truthfully. No, I think that’s all. Thank you… I suppose. Although I still believe a simple antibiotic would have sufficed. .
