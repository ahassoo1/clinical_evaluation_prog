DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. Thank you for seeing me. I have… something coming out of my ear. A liquid. It is not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A liquid discharge from your ear that’s causing you discomfort. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe three days ago? It is clear, sometimes a little… yellowish. Not much smell. It drips when I lie down, mostly. And my ear feels… full. Like water inside.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days ago, clear to yellowish discharge, drips when lying down, and a feeling of fullness. Is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More… pressure. Like when airplane takes off. It makes my head feel… funny. Not a sharp pain, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable pressure. And I cannot hear very well in that ear now.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure similar to airplane takeoff, no sharp pain, and decreased hearing in that ear. Have you noticed any fever, dizziness, or nausea alongside this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I have not felt dizzy. And no, I have not been sick to my stomach. Just this ear. Nothing else is wrong. I eat normally, sleep normally. It is just this… problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No fever, dizziness, or nausea. Just the ear issue, and no other symptoms. Have you had any ear infections in the past, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy. In Somalia. Many years ago. My mother, she used to put something warm in my ear. I do not remember what it was. But I have not had trouble with my ears since… until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections in childhood, treated with warm compresses, and nothing since until now. Do you have any allergies to medications, and are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I do not take any pills. Nothing at all. I like to keep my body… simple. Just food and water and sleep. No medicine for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies and no current medications. Now, I'm going to need to take a look in your ear to see what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you to look. I just want it to stop feeling full. And to hear again.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly cloudy. There’s a little redness as well. It looks like you may have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer's ear. It’s fairly common. Now, I am going to feel around your ear and neck to check for tenderness and swelling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. "Swimmer's ear," you say? I do not swim often. I mostly stay inside and read. But if you need to feel, please do. I want to understand what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness behind the ear, but no significant swelling. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, "swimmer’s ear" is still the most likely diagnosis, even though you don’t swim frequently. It can happen with anything that irritates the ear canal. Now, do you have any history of diabetes or any conditions that affect your immune system?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes. My family… we do not have that trouble. And I am a healthy man, mostly. I eat good food. I sleep well. My body is strong. I do not have trouble with my… immunity, as you say.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No diabetes or immune issues. Alright, Mr. Radillo, I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops, an antibiotic and a steroid combination, to help clear up the infection and reduce the inflammation. You'll need to put these in your ear twice a day for seven days. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry – no swimming, and try to avoid getting water in it during showers. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Seven days, twice a day. And keep it dry. Yes, I can do that. No swimming. Easy. What if I… forget? Will that be bad? And what if the drops… sting?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. If you forget a dose, just take it as soon as you remember, unless it’s very close to your next dose. Then just skip it and continue with your regular schedule. It's more important to be consistent than to worry about a single missed dose. As for stinging, some people experience a slight burning sensation when they first put the drops in, but it usually subsides quickly. If the stinging is severe or doesn't go away, please let me know. I can prescribe a different type of drop. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is very helpful. If I forget, just take the next one. And if it stings, I will call you. That makes me feel better. Thank you. Will this… fix my hearing? When can I expect it to return?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Most people experience improvement in their hearing within a few days of starting the ear drops. It should gradually return to normal as the infection clears. If you don't see any improvement within 5 to 7 days, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can reassess the situation. I'm also going to give you a handout with detailed instructions on how to use the ear drops, and what to watch out for. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very kind. A handout will be helpful. I will follow your instructions carefully. Thank you again for your help. I hope to hear better soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Here’s that handout. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get well soon!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Piet. I will. Goodbye.
