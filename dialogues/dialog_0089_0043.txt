DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band sometimes. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Three weeks of headaches… that's good to know. And you describe it as a tight band sensation in the back of your head, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, really. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes after I’ve been sittin’ and readin’ for a bit. I do a lot of readin’, you see. Old news, mostly. And sometimes it just… is there. Not after exertion or anything like that. It doesn’t get worse with activity, just… a dull ache. Does that make sense? I'm terrible at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Percell. You're explaining it just fine. No worse with activity, comes and goes seemingly at random, and feels like a dull ache in the back of your head. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you rate this headache at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ten… that’s a bad one. Hmm… I’d say maybe a four, five on a bad day. It's not crippling, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. Just… annoyin’. Enough to make it hard to concentrate on my readin’, though. I like to really focus when I read, you see. And this keeps pullin' my attention away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four to five out of ten, more annoying than debilitating. It interferes with your reading, which you enjoy and focus on. Have you noticed anything else happening with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. No nausea, no dizziness. My vision's been fine, I think. I haven't been seein’ spots or anything like that. And no fever, that I’ve noticed. Oh, wait… now that you mention it, sometimes my neck feels a little stiff on the same side as the headache. Not always, but sometimes. Just a little bit. Does that count? I also haven’t been sleepin' as well, but I figured that was just bein’ an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no nausea, dizziness, vision changes, or fever. Sometimes a stiff neck on the same side as the headache, and you've noticed some trouble sleeping. That’s helpful. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the headache so far?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve taken some of those over-the-counter pain relievers. You know, ibuprofen, that sort of thing. Helps a little, maybe takes the edge off for a couple of hours. But it always comes back. I don’t take ‘em too often, don’t want to rely on pills, you see. Mostly I just try to ignore it and keep readin'. Probably not the best approach, huh? My daughter, she always tells me to go to the doctor…
DOCTOR: It’s good you're not relying on them heavily. And it's smart of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. Okay, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. That was… oh, about ten years ago now. Been pretty good since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I suppose. Arthritis in my hands a little bit, but nothin’ major. I used to be quite active, you know, lots of fishin' and huntin’ when I was younger. But those days are mostly behind me now. No surgeries, no serious illnesses, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and some arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. And no surgeries or serious illnesses. Any family history of headaches, or any other neurological conditions, like stroke or dementia?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. My mother, she used to get terrible headaches, but she never really went to the doctor much. Just suffered through ‘em, she did. And my father… he passed away pretty young, heart attack. I don’t remember him havin’ headaches. On my wife's side… her brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but she didn't have a lot of health problems herself. I don’t know…it’s hard to say, truthfully. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about medical things. Mostly just dealt with it on our own.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. Mother had headaches, father had a heart attack, and an uncle had a stroke. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than the occasional ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin every now and then, that's about it. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fish and vegetables. My daughter worries about me, always making sure I’m takin’ enough vitamins. I haven’t needed any regular medication for years, thankfully. I like to stay independent, you see. Don't want to be reliant on pills and doctors as much as possible. Though, I suppose comin’ in here today is a bit of a contradiction, huh?
DOCTOR: Not a contradiction at all, Percell. It's good to be proactive about your health, and seeking help when you need it is a sign of strength, not weakness. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I always figured I was a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Though, I suppose that’s what everyone thinks, huh? Go right ahead. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength seems good in all extremities. Good strength. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Coordination is good. There’s some mild tenderness in the left neck muscles. No swelling or masses. Okay, that's all. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by some neck muscle tension. The mild tenderness in your neck supports that. It’s not likely anything more serious, but we can do some further investigation to rule out other causes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with medications before. Tension headaches… that sounds about right, actually. I do spend a lot of time hunched over readin’, and I reckon my posture isn’t the best. Exacerbated… that's a big word, isn't it? Just means made worse, right? So, what sort of investigation are we talkin' about? Is it somethin’ painful? I’m not a big fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re right, exacerbated just means made worse. And you’re right to ask about needles. For now, I wouldn’t recommend any invasive tests like blood draws or injections. I was thinking of starting with some conservative management – things like over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, heat or ice packs for your neck, and possibly some physical therapy or stretching exercises. If your symptoms don’t improve after a few weeks, we can consider an MRI to rule out any other underlying causes, but I don’t think that’s necessary at this point. The MRI involves lying still in a scanner and doesn't involve needles. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. No needles, that's good. Heat or ice, I can manage that. And stretchin’… well, I probably should do more of that. My daughter’s been tellin’ me that for years. So, over-the-counter pain relievers, heat/ice, and stretchin’. And then, if it doesn't get better, this MRI. You said it doesn't involve needles?
DOCTOR: That's correct, Percell. No needles involved with the MRI. It's a painless imaging test. We'll start with the conservative management. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just in case the neck tension is particularly bothersome. It’s not something you have to take, but it might help. It's important to take it as directed, if you decide to use it. I'll also give you a handout with some stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders. And I want you to keep a headache diary – just write down when you get headaches, how severe they are, and what you did that day. That will help us track your progress. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… hmm. I don’t know… I’m always a little wary of takin’ pills, you see. But I suppose if it helps… alright. And a headache diary, you say? Like writin’ down when they happen and how bad they are? I can manage that, I reckon. Just gotta remember to do it. So, muscle relaxant – maybe, headache diary – definitely, conservative management – that’s the heat and ice, right? And then, if that doesn’t work, this MRI. Is that all? I think I got it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Percell, you’ve got it exactly right. Muscle relaxant – optional, headache diary – important, conservative management – heat and ice, and then, if it doesn't improve, we’ll consider the MRI. I’m going to also write a referral for physical therapy. They can teach you some specific exercises to help strengthen your neck and improve your posture. Do you have any trouble getting transportation to appointments?
PATIENT: Transportation… well, sometimes. My daughter helps out when she can, but she’s got her own life, you see. I mostly take the bus, but it can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. Especially with the heat lately. I reckon I can manage, though. I’m pretty independent, I’ve always been. But I appreciate you askin’. So, the referral is for…exercises and strengthenin'? The physical therapy?
DOCTOR: Yes, the referral is for physical therapy. They'll assess your neck and shoulder muscles and develop a personalized exercise program to help with your posture and strengthen your muscles. They can also teach you techniques to manage pain and prevent future headaches. I’ll also send the prescription to your usual pharmacy. Here’s the handout with the stretching exercises and the information about the physical therapy referral. Do you have any other questions for me today, Percell?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man complain about his head. I'll give the diary a try, and see how it goes. And I'll think about the muscle relaxant. Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your headaches get worse, or you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, or weakness – please seek medical attention immediately. It was nice meeting you. And please, focus on enjoying your reading! .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will try to enjoy my readin’, and I will call if anything changes. Have a good day now. .
