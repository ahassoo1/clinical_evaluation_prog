DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s…well, things aren’t working properly. My vision, it’s gone cloudy, and I can barely hear a thing. It happened rather suddenly, you understand. I have a very busy schedule, so if we could just get this sorted…
DOCTOR: “Suddenly,” you say. Hmm. And how long ago did this “sudden” clouding of vision and hearing loss begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I really don't keep track of such things. Perhaps… a week? Maybe less. It’s all rather blurry, if you’ll pardon the pun. It was after… after a rather important gala, I believe. Honestly, all these social events run together. Is it really necessary to know the precise day? I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. A week, give or take. And you said this happened after a gala. Were there any… unusual circumstances at this gala?
PATIENT: Unusual? Doctor, it was a charity event. Perfectly respectable people, perfectly respectable… champagne. I can’t imagine anything “unusual” occurred. Though, now that you mention it, there was a rather loud band. Perhaps that affected my hearing? It was terribly modern music. Not to my taste at all. Really, I’d hardly think…
DOCTOR: A loud band, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I said a loud band. Are you even listening? It was quite dreadful. All sorts of… banging and crashing. Honestly, it felt deliberately unpleasant. What possible relevance could this have to my failing senses? I assure you, my hearing is perfectly good when exposed to civilized music.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Julie, loud noises can certainly contribute to hearing loss. It’s a rather basic principle of audiology, really. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll need to do a quick examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, let’s take a look at your ears. Could you please turn your head to the left?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I must warn you, Doctor, I have the most sensitive ears. I’ve always had them professionally cleaned. I simply won’t tolerate anything… rough. And do be quick about it. I have a very important appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup, as you said. Not excessive, but present. And the tympanic membrane appears… slightly dull. Now, let’s take a look at the right ear. Similar findings on this side. Dull tympanic membranes bilaterally. Now, let's check your vision. Could you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is hardly necessary. I’ve always had perfect vision. Is this… deliberately blurry? I can barely make out the letters. E… P… Q? Is that a Q? This is preposterous!
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a Q. And you’re having difficulty reading even that line?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Doctor, I can't see the line properly! It's all a smudge. Honestly, I've never encountered such poor quality eye charts. Perhaps your equipment is malfunctioning? I really think you should have a specialist look at this. I have better things to do than strain my eyes in here. This is taking far too long. I believe I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, please. It’s becoming clear that you're experiencing both visual and auditory deficits. While I understand your frustration, dismissing these symptoms won't make them disappear. The quick exam I've performed suggests something more than just poor equipment is at play. I strongly recommend we order some basic tests - an audiogram to assess your hearing and a visual field test to determine the extent of your vision loss. We also should consider a CT scan of the brain to rule out any serious underlying cause. Given the sudden onset of symptoms, we need to investigate this thoroughly. Do you consent to these tests?
