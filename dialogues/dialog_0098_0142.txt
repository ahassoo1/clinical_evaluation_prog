DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s these headaches, really. They come on… strong, and fast. And I get really sweaty when they do, and my heart kinda races. It’s… not fun. I don't really remember when they started, exactly. Just that it's been happening on and off for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come on strong and fast, accompanied by sweating and a racing heart… that does sound unpleasant. It’s alright if you don’t remember precisely when they began; we can try to piece things together. Just to get a better picture, can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… It’s… a throbbing, mostly. Like, a really bad pressure, all over my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s behind my eyes, too. And it’s not just a little ache, it’s… really intense. It makes it hard to think straight, to be honest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jaxston. A throbbing pressure, sometimes behind the eyes, intense enough to interfere with your thinking. And how long do these headaches typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. That's… a good question. It varies, I think. Sometimes just an hour or so, but other times… it feels like all day. Honestly, when it’s bad, I usually just try to sleep it off, so I don't really know how long they last. Could be a few hours, could be most of the day. I'm really not good with time, apparently.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll figure it out. It’s common to lose track when you’re not feeling well. Now, do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… Not that I’ve noticed, really. I mean, nothing specific. I work in a factory, it’s kinda loud and busy. Maybe that? But I’ve been doing that for years, and they haven’t always been happening. Sometimes they just… start. I wish I knew what brought them on, it’d be a lot easier to deal with. I don't drink a lot, don't smoke. Not much of a partier, if that's what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, factory work… that's helpful to know. Let’s talk about other symptoms. When you have these headaches, do you experience anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I might throw up, but I haven't actually done that. And I get really sensitive to light, like it's too bright. That's why I usually try to lie down in a dark room when they hit. And… I think I get a little dizzy, sometimes. Nothing major, just a bit off balance. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Nausea, light sensitivity, and some dizziness… Yes, that does help paint a clearer picture. Do these headaches affect your vision in any way?
PATIENT: Vision… Not really, I don't think. Everything looks… normal. Although… sometimes, right before a headache starts, I get like, little sparkly things in my vision. Just for a few seconds, though. Like, little flashes. I figured it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. Is that… weird?
DOCTOR: Sparkly things, or flashes in your vision, right before the headaches start… That’s good information, Jaxston, thank you for telling me. It’s not necessarily “weird”, but it’s important to note. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Uh… not that I know of. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but it healed fine. I was divorced a few years back, does that count? I'm not insured, if that matters. Honestly, I haven't really needed a doctor much in my life. I try to stay healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just childhood illnesses and a broken arm. And you're currently uninsured. That’s helpful to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Nope. Never had any. I really avoid hospitals if I can. Bad memories, probably. I don't do well with needles, either. So I definitely haven’t been under the knife. No, definitely no surgeries. I'm pretty sure. I’d remember something like that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You’re right, you would. No surgeries. Let’s move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… My mom got headaches sometimes, yeah, but she just took some pills and got on with it. Never really talked about it much. My dad… I don’t really know. He wasn’t around much. And I don’t really keep in touch with my siblings. So, honestly, I don’t know if anyone else had anything similar. It's not something we discussed, if that makes sense. They were… not the most open family. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information already. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. Finally, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking a bunch of pills unless I absolutely have to. I'm not a fan of relying on medication, if I can avoid it. So no, nothing. Just… trying to get through it, usually. I drink water, I guess, if that counts. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound silly at all. Staying hydrated is good. Alright, Jaxston. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Just… try not to poke me too much, okay? I'm a bit jumpy.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious neurological deficits. No tenderness to palpation in the head or neck. Full range of motion in the eyes. No nystagmus. Everything appears normal so far, Jaxston. But based on your description of the headaches – the throbbing pain, the sweating, the light sensitivity, and the flashes in your vision – and the fact that they come on so suddenly, I’m concerned about the possibility of migraines or cluster headaches. It's also important to rule out other possible causes.
