DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s… well, it’s my eyes and ears. They’ve been acting up, and it’s quite disruptive. I simply haven’t the time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand. Disruptive symptoms are never good. Let's try to figure this out. When did you first notice problems with your eyes and ears?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. Everything seems to blur together these days, you know? It must have been… a few weeks ago, perhaps? It came on rather suddenly, I believe. I really don’t recall the exact date. Is that important? I have a luncheon to attend, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don’t remember the exact date, Ms. Julie. A few weeks is helpful. Sudden onset is good to know. Could you describe what you're experiencing with your eyes?
PATIENT: Well, it’s as I said – blurry. Everything is just… not sharp. It’s like looking through a dirty window, I suppose. And sometimes, it feels like there’s a… a veil over everything. It’s very unpleasant, and makes reading quite difficult. I do crossword puzzles, you know. A rather advanced level, actually. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and a “veil” sensation… and it’s affecting your crossword puzzles, I understand. Is the blurriness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… inconsistent, I’d say. Some days it's barely noticeable, and others… well, others it’s quite dreadful. This morning, it was particularly bad. I nearly walked into a potted plant! Honestly, the help these days… they should be paying more attention to rearranging things. It’s a hazard.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent blurry vision, worse this morning… and you mentioned something about your ears?
PATIENT: Yes, the ears. A most annoying problem. It's a muffled sound, you see. Like someone has stuffed cotton in them. I can hear, of course, but everything is… distant. And I keep having to ask people to repeat themselves, which is quite embarrassing. It's simply dreadful during conversations.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, along with the blurry vision… Do you experience any ringing in your ears, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Ringing? Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. It’s not constant, mind you. Just a faint… buzzing. It’s probably nothing. It’s this dreadful humidity, I suspect. It plays havoc with everything. Honestly, you wouldn’t believe the state of my hair.
DOCTOR: A faint buzzing… alright. And have you noticed any dizziness or balance problems at all, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Balance problems? Doctor, I assure you, I have excellent balance. I was a rather proficient dancer in my youth. No, I haven't fallen or anything of the sort. The dizziness… perhaps a slight wooziness sometimes when I stand up too quickly, but that’s just age, I suppose. It’s hardly worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wooziness upon standing… I understand. Just to get a complete picture, Ms. Julie, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve had?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. There have been… things. A touch of arthritis, naturally. And a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years back. I had a hysterectomy, quite some time ago. And… I suppose my divorce was rather traumatic. Does that count as a medical condition? It certainly felt like one at the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Arthritis, shingles, hysterectomy… we’ll note those. And while a divorce can feel traumatic, we'll focus on the medical history for now. Any allergies to medications, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Penicillin, I believe. Gave me a dreadful rash. And I’m rather sensitive to codeine. Makes me terribly nauseous. Other than that… no, I can’t think of anything. I do prefer natural remedies, whenever possible, of course. Chemicals are so dreadful for the system.
DOCTOR: Penicillin and codeine allergies noted. And you prefer natural remedies… alright. Are you currently taking any medications at all, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Just this. It’s a herbal tincture my niece makes. For my arthritis, you see. And a little vitamin D, the doctor recommended it last winter. Other than that… no, nothing at all. I believe in a good diet and a healthy lifestyle. Honestly, these modern medications are just… a band-aid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you for that information. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll check your ears, your vision, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, must we? I really do have that luncheon. But… very well. If it will be quick. I simply haven't the time for a lengthy examination. Just please be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And do hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's check your ears. Hmm… both ear canals are clear, but there’s some fluid behind the eardrums. A little redness as well. Now, let’s check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is terribly small print. And the lighting in here is dreadful. E… F… P… T… Oh, and… L. Is that right? I usually have excellent vision, you know. Perhaps I need new glasses.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Your vision is slightly reduced – about 20/30 in both eyes. Now, I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes to check your reflexes. Your pupils are reactive to light, but a little sluggish. Finally, I’m just going to check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, I really don’t like being tested like this. It’s undignified. There. See? Perfectly fine. Although, this floor is rather slippery. It's a hazard, really. Now, can we please be done? I'm starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie, please sit back down. You do seem a little unsteady. It’s alright. Based on the exam, and what you've told me, I think you might be experiencing a viral inner ear infection – potentially labyrinthitis. It can cause inflammation of the inner ear, affecting both your hearing and balance. The sluggish reflexes and reduced vision could be related. However, because of the reduced vision and the unsteady gait, I’d like to be cautious. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to recommend a CT scan of your head, just to be safe. And I’d also like to refer you to an ENT specialist for a more thorough evaluation of your ears. What do you think?
PATIENT: A CT scan? An ENT specialist? Doctor, are you telling me I’m seriously ill? This is ridiculous! I simply have a little trouble with my ears and vision. A CT scan sounds… drastic. And I have absolutely no intention of seeing another doctor. Honestly, these specialists just want to run more tests and charge more money. No, thank you. I think I’ll just get a second opinion from my niece. She’s very good with herbal remedies, you know. I believe that will be all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns, but I must emphasize the importance of ruling out other potential causes, especially given your unsteady gait and reduced vision. While an herbal remedy may provide some relief, it may not address the underlying issue. I strongly advise you reconsider the CT scan and the ENT referral. If you are not comfortable with those options at this time, I will document your refusal. However, if your symptoms worsen – such as increased dizziness, difficulty walking, or significant vision changes – please seek immediate medical attention. Here's a written summary of our consultation and my recommendations. Please read it carefully. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best.
