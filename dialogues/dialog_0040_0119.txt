DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Wartick, it's good to finally get to you. Busy day, as always. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's… rather embarrassing to discuss. But I suppose that's what one comes to a doctor for. It's… a problem. A delicate problem, really. A gentleman friend… well, he’s experiencing a… discharge. It’s not pleasant. And frankly, I’m concerned. It just doesn't seem… hygienic.
DOCTOR: A… discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A discharge. It’s… well, it’s not normal, is it? And he’s quite… private. He doesn’t want to make a fuss, you see. That’s why I’m here. I thought perhaps you could… advise? Discreetly, of course. It’s simply dreadful, and I do hope it isn’t… catching.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Wartick, with all due respect, I’m a family doctor. I treat people, not… situations. And frankly, this sounds like a matter for a specialist. A urologist, perhaps?
PATIENT: A specialist? Good heavens, no! That would involve… tests. And explanations! He’d be mortified! I simply wanted a… a quick opinion. A reassurance, perhaps? Is it something… serious? Could it be a simple… irritation? I assure you, he's a very… clean man. It must be something minor.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Wartick, I can’t just guess at what this is. It could be a number of things, and jumping to conclusions without proper examination is irresponsible. And frankly, a bit… naïve. I’m not comfortable offering a diagnosis based on hearsay. Is he experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? I… I haven't asked. It’s a delicate subject, you understand. He’s a very stoic man. He wouldn’t complain unless it were… unbearable. But he has been a bit… quieter than usual. And he’s been avoiding… certain activities. It's just… worrying. I just thought, as a doctor, you could suggest something. A cream, perhaps? A simple remedy? Is it… is it something one gets from… bad women? I read something in a magazine…
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, with all due respect, I’m not going to entertain speculation about the origins of a medical condition based on a magazine article. That's… frankly, ridiculous. And trying to self-treat without a proper diagnosis is a terrible idea. It could make things worse. Look, I'm going to say this one more time. He needs to see a doctor. A urologist. I can give you a referral, but I will not be providing medical advice on this matter. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A referral… Ugh. Fine. But you won’t tell anyone about this, will you? It’s terribly embarrassing, you understand. And frankly, I doubt he'll even go. He's a very proud man. Still… I suppose it’s better than… whatever this is getting worse. Yes, a referral, then. But please, discretion. This is very important. And do you have any idea how long the wait might be? He's quite busy, you see.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. I'll generate a referral to Dr. Albright – he's a good urologist, very discreet. As for waiting times… it varies. I can't give you a precise estimate, but I'll mark it as urgent. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are we finished?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that will be all. Thank you… I suppose. Though I'm not entirely pleased about this whole affair. Just… please ensure the referral is handled with the utmost confidentiality. And could I have a copy for my records? Just in case. Yes, that would be most appreciated. Thank you again, Doctor. Though I still maintain it’s probably just an irritation.
DOCTOR: Here you are. And Mrs. Wartick, I strongly advise him to be honest with Dr. Albright about all his symptoms. It’s the only way to get an accurate diagnosis. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Honesty. I’ll… I’ll mention it. Though I doubt he’ll appreciate me quizzing him about… details. Good day to you too, Doctor. And thank you… again.
