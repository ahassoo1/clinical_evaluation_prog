DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 52 years old. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fifty-two. It’s… tiredness. Just very, very tired. All the time. Not like… normal tired after work. This is… different. Been going on for maybe a month now, I think. Hard to say exactly. My wife keeps telling me to come see someone. She says I’m sleeping too much and still tired. Women. Always noticing things.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Different” is helpful. Sleeping too much and still fatigued… that is something we need to investigate. A month is a reasonable timeframe to start. Can you describe this tiredness a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like… heavy. Like someone put weights on my legs. And… I don’t want to do things. Even things I like. I used to like working on the… the cloths, you know? Making things. Now… I just sit. And look. It's not a happy tired. It's a… a stuck tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Stuck tired," yes, I think I understand. That is a useful description. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life, and that's concerning. Are there any times of day when it's worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse… always mornings. Always. Takes a long time to… wake up. Even then, I feel like I’m… moving through water. Slow. And it doesn't really get much better. Maybe a little bit in the afternoon if I… force myself to do something. But then it comes back. Evenings… just want to sleep. Maybe that's why my wife is so worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mornings being the worst and gradually… not improving much throughout the day. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My stomach… sometimes feels not good. Not sick, exactly. Just… heavy. Like when you eat too much. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My pants feel looser. My wife says I’m eating less, but… I don’t really notice. I just don't feel hungry much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stomach discomfort, feeling of fullness, unintentional weight loss, and decreased appetite. These are all important details. Now, I'm going to ask you some broader questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. Chills… not really. Maybe a little cold sometimes, but that's just the… air conditioning. We like it cold. Night sweats… no. I sleep pretty warm, actually. My wife complains. She likes a fan. Always something with women.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? You mean… going to the bathroom? Well… it’s a little… different. Not as much, you know? And… sometimes it’s… lighter. Not dark. Lighter. Like… clay, maybe. I don’t know. I don't pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Changes in bowel habits… less frequent, lighter stools. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any pain or discomfort when you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Blood? No. No blood. And… no pain. Just… not much happening. That’s all. It’s just… different. Everything is just… different lately. Makes me feel old, you know?
DOCTOR: It's good that there's no blood. "Different" is still a useful description, but we need to try and be more specific. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… a few years ago, the doctor said my liver… was not good. Something about… tests. I don't remember exactly. He said I needed to watch what I eat. And drink less… the strong drink. I’ve been trying. Not perfect, but… trying. They gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. Made me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: A history of liver issues… and you stopped taking the medication prescribed for it. Do you remember the name of the medication, or what the doctor told you about the specific liver condition?
PATIENT: No. I don't remember the name. Too many pills. He just said… liver. Something about too much… something. He kept talking about alcohol. And fat. He said I needed to lose weight. I think it was something about… fatty liver? Maybe? I don't pay attention to these things. My wife does. She's the one who remembers.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible fatty liver disease, non-compliance with medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Nothing I know of. I eat everything. Except maybe… those shellfish things. They make my stomach not happy. But that’s just… shellfish. Not an allergy. My wife likes them. I don’t. That’s all.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, aversion to shellfish. And currently, are you taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not right now. Like I said, I stopped taking the pills the doctor gave me. I don't take anything else. My wife tries to get me to take some… vitamin things. But I don’t like them. They taste bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and possibly some neurological tests. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's wrong with me. Tired all the time… it’s no way to live. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll begin with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there's some mild decreased breath sound in the bases. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Feels… normal. Maybe a little… full. But not pain. Just… heavy. Like I said, my stomach hasn't been happy lately. Especially in the mornings. Like everything is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and the liver feels slightly enlarged. It’s not significantly firm, but it’s definitely larger than expected. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Alright, based on the examination, your symptoms and history, and the findings here today – enlargement of the liver, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, fatigue, decreased appetite, and changes in bowel habits – I suspect there may be some ongoing issues with your liver. We'll need to run some blood tests to confirm this, and potentially some imaging.
PATIENT: Imaging? What kind of imaging? Like… pictures? Is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. And what kind of blood tests? Lots of needles? I don’t like needles. Just tell me… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it's too early to say definitively whether it's “serious.” That’s why we need the tests. The blood tests will assess your liver function, looking at enzymes and other markers to see how well it's working. And yes, there will be needles involved, but it's a standard blood draw. The imaging would likely be an ultrasound, which is non-invasive and uses sound waves to create a picture of your liver. It’s not particularly expensive, and Medicare should cover a significant portion. We’re simply gathering information at this point. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We’ll also schedule an abdominal ultrasound. I want you to avoid alcohol completely until we have the results back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, I understand. No alcohol. No needles… well, I have to have the needles. And… pictures of my liver. Sounds… unpleasant. When will I get the results? And what happens if… if it’s bad? My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound may take a few days longer to schedule and review. As for what happens if… the results are concerning, we will discuss all your options. This could include further testing, medication adjustments, or a referral to a gastroenterologist. I assure you, we will address this systematically. It’s important to remember that many liver conditions are manageable, especially if caught early. Avoid alcohol and follow my instructions, and we’ll take it from there. I'm going to have the nurse schedule you for these tests now. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… no. Just… no more questions. Get it over with. Then I can go home and… sleep. Even if I’m still tired. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Grumman.
