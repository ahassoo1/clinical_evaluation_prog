DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Stilaire, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now, I think. A dry cough. Just… sticks with me. Doesn't really hurt, just… bothersome. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it’s getting… well, it's just there. I can't quite remember when it started, though. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. Yes, Stilaire is correct. A persistent cough can certainly be bothersome. You mentioned it's been going on for a “long time” and is dry. And you're having some difficulty recalling exactly when it began. That’s perfectly alright; we'll try to piece things together. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… Well, it’s not like a… whooping cough, not like when my grandkids had that. It's… a little tickle at first, then I just… hack. Not much comes up, though. Just… air. It happens mostly when I’m sitting, I think. Or maybe when I lie down. Hard to say. I used to work with cars a lot, you know. Body work. Lots of dust, maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t rightly remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Mr. Pavlovic. It sounds like it’s a non-productive cough – meaning little to no mucus is brought up. And you suspect a possible connection to your previous work with cars, due to dust exposure. That’s a very good thought, and certainly something we need to consider. Now, aside from the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I try to carry something heavy. I don’t get a fever, not that I’ve noticed. And I haven’t lost any weight, I don’t think. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more, though. She worries. She’s a good girl. Does that make sense? I sometimes forget what I was saying…
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s very helpful to have that information. Shortness of breath with exertion, such as walking up stairs, is important to note. And the fact that you haven’t experienced fever or weight loss is also reassuring. It’s good that you have a supportive daughter who looks out for you. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a long time ago, Doctor. I remember going to the hospital once, when I was younger, fell off a ladder. Broke my arm, I think. But as for… conditions? The doctor patched me up after the car accidents, of course. Lots of bumps and bruises over the years. Never really had anything… serious. I don't think so. My wife used to handle all the doctor stuff. She was very organized. Now… I just try to keep going. Does that help? I don’t know if I’m being very useful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s understandable that recalling details from a long time ago can be difficult, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. A broken arm in the past is good to know. And it’s helpful that you haven’t had any serious illnesses that you recall. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I used to take something for my arthritis, a little pill, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said it wasn’t doing much good. I don’t take anything now, not unless my daughter gives me something for a cold. She's always worried about me catching something. Just a little cough syrup, sometimes. But that’s it. I mostly just drink tea. Helps soothe the throat, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. So, no current medications except occasional cough syrup as needed, and you previously took medication for arthritis, which was discontinued. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don’t think so. Never really had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. My wife always said I had a strong stomach. She used to make spicy food, very spicy, and I always ate it. Maybe I’m allergic to dust? From the cars… but that’s not a real allergy, is it? I get a little sniffly sometimes, but that’s just the dust. I don’t break out in hives or anything. Does that make sense? I’m probably not much help.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. No known allergies, and you suspect a possible sensitivity to dust. That’s important information. Now, I would like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a hard one. My parents… they both lived a long life, but I don’t really remember what they died of. Something old age, I think. My brother, he had… problems with his heart, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself, smoked a lot. My wife’s side… they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. Lots of farmers, strong people. I don’t really know, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk much about those things. Does that help at all? I wish I could be more useful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. It's understandable that recalling detailed family history can be difficult. Knowing your parents lived a long life and your brother had heart problems is helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. But I'll do whatever you need me to. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Again… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs, particularly on exhale. That can be associated with some airway narrowing. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 94%, which is within normal limits. I’ll also check your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and your blood pressure is 140/85, which is a bit elevated. Finally, I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also normal. Based on what I’ve heard and seen, the wheezing in your lungs and elevated blood pressure are the most significant findings. Your cough and shortness of breath, combined with these findings, suggest a possible respiratory issue. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I always figured it was just old age catching up with me. My wife always said I was getting too sentimental. Maybe that’s what’s making me breathe funny. Elevated blood pressure… I remember the doctor mentioning that once, a long time ago. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. I don’t add much salt to my food, though. Mostly just tea, like I said. So… what does this mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it the cars? I shouldn’t have worked with those cars so much, should I? My daughter always warned me about the dust…
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Pavlovic. The wheezing indicates some narrowing of your airways, which can make it harder to breathe. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but it does warrant further investigation. While your past work with cars and dust exposure could be a contributing factor, it’s difficult to say definitively without more information. Dust exposure can certainly irritate the lungs and contribute to respiratory problems. However, there are many other potential causes. Given your age and symptoms, the most likely possibilities include chronic bronchitis, asthma, or possibly even early signs of heart failure, which can sometimes cause shortness of breath and wheezing. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function. We'll also do some blood tests to rule out any infections or other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and… ECG? Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. I don’t like going to the hospital, Doctor. Too many bright lights and beeping noises. My wife always said I was a nervous patient. Blood tests too? I don’t like needles. I always faint when they try to take my blood. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can try. I don't want to be a bother. Is it… painful? Will it take long? I have to get home for dinner, you know. My daughter makes a lovely roast on Sundays. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious about medical tests, especially if you've had unpleasant experiences in the past. I assure you, we'll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. The chest X-ray is painless; you simply stand or sit in front of the machine while a picture of your lungs is taken. It takes just a few minutes. The ECG also doesn't involve needles. Small, sticky patches are placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It's a quick and non-invasive procedure. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, but it's usually very quick. We'll have a nurse draw the blood, and they're very skilled at minimizing discomfort. If you’re prone to fainting, please let them know, and they will take extra precautions. You can lie down during the procedure, and we can have someone stay with you. The tests should take about an hour in total, including preparation and waiting time. I’ll arrange for you to have them done at the hospital, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Would you like me to explain anything further, or would you like me to proceed with the arrangements?
PATIENT: An hour… alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor, go ahead. I trust your judgment. But please, tell the nurse I get nervous easily. And if I start to feel faint, just… tell them to stop, alright? My daughter will be worried if anything happens to me. She’s a good girl. And… will I get the results right away? Or will it take a long time? I don’t want to keep worrying about it for weeks. I have to get home for dinner, you know. Roast on Sundays. It’s a tradition.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. I completely understand. I will write a note for the nurse detailing your anxiety and request that they take extra care and allow you to lie down during the blood draw. If you feel faint at any time, they will stop immediately. Your comfort is our priority. The lab usually provides the results within 24 to 48 hours. I will review them as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. If there are any urgent findings, I will call you immediately. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week so we can discuss the results in person and develop a plan of care. We will do our best to expedite the process so you don’t have to worry about it for too long. Now, before you head over to the hospital, do you have any questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy, you know? Everything aches, and I forget everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for writing a note for the nurse. I feel a little better now. Roast on Sundays… I have to remember to tell my daughter I might be late. I suppose I should go then. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. You're a good doctor. A very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, try not to worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Enjoy your roast on Sunday, and give your daughter my best. Have a good day, Mr. Pavlovic. And please, take care.
