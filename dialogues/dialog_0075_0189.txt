DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I noticed something wasn't right, and frankly, at my age, one doesn’t just ignore these things. It was in the stool, you see. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be… concerning. I’ve seen things, flown things, and I know what's normal and what isn’t. And this wasn’t normal.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your body, and very wise to get it checked out. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t need a lot of investigating. It's blood. Plain and simple. But fine, if you must know details. It was… bright red. Not mixed in, exactly. More… coating things. Happened just this morning, and yesterday, a little bit. Though yesterday I thought it might have been something I ate. Beets, maybe? I had beets with my dinner. Though I don't usually eat beets. Now, are you going to poke around or what? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood is helpful information, thank you. And it’s good you considered your diet – beets can cause that, but it's good to rule things out. No, I won’t be “poking around” immediately. We’ll start with a thorough conversation, and then I'll need to do a physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Before we get to that, could you tell me a little about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kind of question is that? I go to the bathroom when I need to, Doctor. It’s not like I have a schedule. Though, now that you mention it, I suppose it's been… a bit looser lately. Not full-blown diarrhea, you understand. Just… not as solid as it used to be. And I haven’t been going every day. Sometimes skip a day, sometimes two. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, this is getting rather personal.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel personal, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s all part of understanding what might be causing the bleeding. Changes in bowel habits – looser stools, less frequent movements – are important clues. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, or with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little cramping sometimes, lower down. But I've always had a sensitive stomach. Flying all those hours, different foods… you pick up things. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Comes and goes. Mostly after I… well, you know. And sometimes I feel like I haven't completely emptied things out. Like there’s still something left. Does that make any sense? I swear, young people these days don't understand what a stomach is capable of.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Rowbottom. Cramping, a dull ache, and the sensation of incomplete evacuation – those are all helpful pieces of the puzzle. You’ve flown a great deal, and that definitely can contribute to digestive issues. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. I've had the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. My knees aren't what they used to be, and my back gives me trouble when the weather changes. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart years ago, but the doctor said it was nothing serious. Just a flutter, he called it. Otherwise, I’ve always been a strong one. Never been one for taking pills, if you catch my drift. Prefer to let nature take its course. And honestly, Doctor, these new doctors with all their fancy machines… I’m not convinced they know any more than the old ones.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good to know you’ve generally been a strong and healthy individual. Knee and back pain are common with age, and it’s helpful to know about the heart flutter. We’ll certainly respect your preference for avoiding medication whenever possible. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… oh, yes. Appendicitis, back in ‘68. It was a bit of a mess, but they got it sorted. And I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that hardly counts. Other than that, no. I've always been careful, avoided unnecessary risks. A pilot can't afford to be laid up with recovery. It's a dangerous job, you know. Not like these youngsters who push buttons and let the computer do all the work. A real pilot has to know what's going on, inside and out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Appendectomy and tonsillectomy are good to know. It sounds like you’ve led a very active life, and it’s good you’ve been so careful with your health. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my father was a fisherman. Strong man, died young, heart trouble. Mother lived to be 92, but she was always a bit frail. My brother, he had some sort of stomach ailment when he was younger, but I don’t recall the details. Nothing major, as far as I know. They weren't ones for going to doctors, either. "Man up" was their motto. Though, my aunt… on my mother's side… she had something. Cancer, I think. Colon cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. A history of heart trouble and a possible family history of colon cancer are important things to consider. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hardly. I told you, I don't believe in pills. Maybe a painkiller now and then for my knees, but that's it. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, if I remember correctly. As for allergies… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Used to have to, on those long flights. All sorts of food. Never bothered me. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a lot of questions. Are we getting anywhere with this blood business? It’s still there, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, Mr. Rowbottom, we are getting to the important details. I apologize for the number of questions, but it’s all necessary to get a clear picture of your health and understand what might be causing the bleeding. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What’s to tell? I live a quiet life these days. Read the paper, watch a bit of television. Used to be very active, of course. Flying, fishing, hiking… But those days are mostly behind me. I don’t drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. And I quit smoking years ago. Bad habit, that was. Did it for far too long. Now, are you going to start poking around soon? My patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your patience and honesty. We’ve covered a lot of ground. Now, let’s proceed with a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll need to do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. I understand this might be uncomfortable, and I’ll do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. Would you like me to explain each step as I go, or would you prefer I just proceed?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Good heavens. At my age? Honestly, Doctor, is this absolutely necessary? I mean, I’ve already told you there’s blood. Isn't that enough? I suppose… if you must. But please, be quick about it. And explain each step, yes. I don’t like surprises. And for goodness sake, be gentle. A man deserves some dignity, even at 88.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. A rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating rectal bleeding, as it allows me to physically check for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. I’ll explain each step before I do it. First, I’m going to ask you to lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will use a lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. I’ll be looking and feeling for any abnormalities. It may cause some discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any pain at any time. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Hmph. Sounds… unpleasant. And frankly, I don’t see how poking around down there is going to tell you anything you don't already know. But fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it. And for goodness sake, don’t use a cold finger. That would be… most unwelcome. I’ve seen enough in my life, I don't need surprises in there. And don’t go digging around too much. Just a quick look is all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m going to gently insert my finger now. Just relax as much as possible. I’m feeling the muscles around your rectum, and checking for any tenderness or masses. I do feel some slight tenderness… and there appears to be some internal hemorrhoids. They are small, but they could be contributing to the bleeding. Okay, that’s all I need for now. Please remain still for a moment while I clean up. .
PATIENT: .
