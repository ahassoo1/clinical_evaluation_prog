DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. KINJERSKI. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Donate. It’s about my leg, actually. It’s been… well, numb, off and on, for about a week now. It’s mostly in my right leg, from the knee down.
DOCTOR: Numbness, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Not completely without feeling, but… diminished, I suppose is the best way to put it. It feels… distant, like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t quite go away completely, even after I move it around. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first notice this, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was August 2nd, actually. I was working on a new animation sequence, mostly standing for long periods, and that’s when I first noticed it. It wasn't severe at first, just a little tingling. But it’s gotten more consistent since then. I remember the date specifically because I had just finished rendering a particularly difficult scene.
DOCTOR: Animation, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I'm a special effects artist and animator. Mostly freelance work, though. A lot of it involves being on my feet or in… less-than-ideal postures for extended periods. I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it, but I thought it might be relevant.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always something with these… creative types. Any pain accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Not exactly pain, Doctor. More of a… ache, sometimes. A dull pressure in my calf, mainly. It's not constant, and it's not sharp or debilitating, but it's definitely there when the numbness is particularly noticeable. It comes and goes with the feeling in my leg, I've found.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your back?
PATIENT: My back? It’s… alright, I suppose. I do get a little stiff after long days, but nothing I haven’t dealt with before. I usually stretch it out, and it feels better. I haven’t noticed any pain specifically radiating down my leg, if that’s what you’re asking. I haven't had any injury to my back recently, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Not… noticeable weakness, no. I haven't tripped or stumbled any more than usual, and I can still walk normally. But… it feels a little less responsive sometimes, if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe. Like it takes a little more effort to lift my foot, perhaps, but it’s very subtle. I haven't been avoiding any activities because of it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at it. If you don’t mind. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. Relax your leg. Just let it hang. …And now, push your foot up against my hand. Good. Now, push it down. …Alright. And now, flex your foot. …Hmm. Patellar reflex… a little diminished. Achilles… also a bit weak. Now, can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I can feel that. It’s… a slight pressure, a little bit cool. Is that what you were checking for?
DOCTOR: And this side?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. It feels… about the same as the other side, actually. Maybe a little less distinct, but not dramatically so. Is there a difference you're noticing?
DOCTOR: Pulses are… adequate. Calf muscle feels… slightly tense. Honestly, it’s probably just… a bit of muscle strain. You spend too much time on your feet, doing… whatever it is you do. It’s likely irritating a nerve.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. But it's been a full week now, and it hasn't improved with rest. I'm a bit concerned it might be something more than just muscle strain, especially since the feeling is… intermittent and sometimes feels more like numbness than pain. Would it be possible to rule out anything more serious, perhaps with an X-ray or some other test? I'd just like to be certain.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve been practicing medicine for seventeen years. I’ve seen plenty of… creative types come in here with self-diagnosed maladies. An X-ray isn't going to show a pinched nerve. It's highly unlikely to be anything serious. However… if it really bothers you, I can order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying inflammation. But I assure you, it’s probably just a waste of your money. And I'm not ordering an MRI.
PATIENT: I appreciate you considering the blood panel, Doctor. While I understand your experience, and I don’t wish to waste anyone’s time or resources, it would certainly provide some peace of mind. I’m not trying to self-diagnose, I just want to rule out anything that could potentially worsen with continued activity. If it’s only inflammation, that would be good to know. I trust your judgment, of course, but I’d feel better being thorough.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'll order the basic metabolic panel and a CBC. But don't expect any surprises. Go to the lab downstairs. They'll take some blood. Results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, ice it, elevate it, and try to… sit down more often. Any questions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. No, I don't believe I have any further questions at the moment. I’ll head downstairs right away. And I will certainly try to be more mindful of resting it. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get out of here. And try not to strain yourself on the way. .
PATIENT: .
