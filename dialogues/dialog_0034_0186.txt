DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Uh, I'm here for a physical. Trying out for a team, need to get cleared. Hope it’s quick, got a bit of a schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. A sports physical, good to know. We'll do our best to be efficient. Just so I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for, and what kind of physical activity is involved?
PATIENT: It’s a… well, it’s a wrestling team. Local thing, mostly. Lots of grappling, you know, throwing people around, holding them down… pretty rough on the body, I imagine. I haven't wrestled competitively in a while, though. Mostly just staying in shape, helping out at the gym.
DOCTOR: Wrestling, alright. That is physically demanding. And just to confirm, you mentioned you haven’t wrestled competitively in a while. About how long has it been, and have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort recently while staying in shape or helping out at the gym?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… five, six years? Something like that. And no, not really pain. A few aches, the usual getting-old stuff, but nothing I haven't worked through. Mostly just feeling a bit winded quicker than I used to, if that makes sense. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear there's no serious pain. Feeling winded more easily is something we should definitely take into account, though. Let me just review your basic information here… I see your height is listed as 183 centimeters and your weight as 129 kilograms. Is that current?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's about right. Maybe a pound or two off, but close enough. I try to keep an eye on it, gotta stay in a weight class, you know? It’s been harder lately, though.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – maintaining a weight class is important. Okay. And do you have any known allergies to medications, or any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. And… uh… no, nothing like that either. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather… he had some trouble with his heart, but he lived to be pretty old, so… not sure how bad it was. Other than that, not really. Everyone else was pretty healthy, I think. It’s hard to remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure in your mother is good to know. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just… sometimes a little ibuprofen for aches, but that's about it. Hardly ever, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. So, before we move onto the physical examination, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Uh… what do you mean? Do you need to know about… like, my hobbies? Or…?
DOCTOR: No, nothing quite so detailed. I just mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. It helps me get a more complete picture of your overall health. And, if you don't mind me asking, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. No smoking, no drugs. I have a beer maybe once a week, sometimes less. Nothing serious. And… I work in media. Communication stuff. It’s… a little of everything. Mostly just keeping things running smoothly. It’s not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Alright, let’s move onto the physical examination. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic musculoskeletal exam to assess your range of motion and any potential areas of concern. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Let's just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got a training session later, gotta be ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’ll just have a seat here, we can get started. First, I'll take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. …Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 90. That's a little elevated. Your heart rate is 78 beats per minute, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths… Is everything alright? It feels a little… tight in my chest sometimes, but it usually goes away. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I do detect a slight wheeze in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little…distant. It's not dramatically concerning, but it warrants further investigation. And you’re right to mention the tightness in your chest. Do you experience this tightness with activity, or is it more random?
PATIENT: It’s mostly with activity. Especially when I'm pushing myself. Like when I'm sparring, or doing drills. It feels… constricted. Like I can't get enough air. Then it goes away when I slow down. I just figured it was getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know about this. Given your family history of high blood pressure and the wheezing and tightness you're experiencing with activity, I'd like to recommend a few tests. Specifically, I think an EKG would be beneficial to assess your heart rhythm, and a pulmonary function test to evaluate your lung capacity and identify any potential airway obstruction. We should also discuss a possible chest X-ray to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… huh. That sounds… serious. I just need to get cleared for the team, you know? I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing. Is there any way we can just… skip the tests? Maybe I can just try a lighter workout and see how it goes? I really don't want to delay things.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get cleared quickly, Lamark, and I don’t want to unnecessarily delay things. However, given your symptoms and family history, it would be irresponsible of me to clear you for strenuous activity without further investigation. The wheezing and chest tightness could indicate underlying issues like asthma, bronchitis, or even early signs of heart problems. Ignoring these symptoms could potentially be dangerous. I want to ensure your safety first and foremost. While a lighter workout might seem tempting, it could exacerbate the problem. The tests will provide valuable information and allow us to create a safe plan for you. We can discuss the cost of the tests with the clinic’s billing department, and explore any available options to help with affordability. I can also provide you with a referral to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist for further evaluation if needed. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests?
PATIENT: …Okay, fine. Do the tests. I guess you're right. It’s just… I really want to be on this team. And I don't want to waste time and money on things I don't need. Just… get it over with as quickly as possible, alright? And let me know the results as soon as you can. I don't have insurance, so… hopefully it won't be too expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lamark. I will do everything I can to expedite the process and work with the billing department to explore affordable options for you, given your lack of insurance. We’ll get the orders in right away, and the clinic staff will assist you with scheduling the tests. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. It’s better to be safe than sorry. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the tests we're ordering. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
