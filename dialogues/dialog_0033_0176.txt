DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Redeye, yes. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s these hiccups, really. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It’s… well, it’s more than annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hiccups. Right. And how long exactly has it been “a couple of days”?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started Sunday, I believe. So, over 48 hours, definitely. Maybe closer to three days now, come to think of it. I lost track a little, to be honest. They keep interrupting my thoughts!
DOCTOR: And are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go. Not constant constant, thankfully. But they’re… frequent. Like, several times an hour, at least. It's hard to do anything when you’re jolted like that every few minutes. Especially trying to plan things for the resort, you know? It’s… disruptive.
DOCTOR: A resort?
PATIENT: Yes! I manage the entertainment at the Oasis Palms Resort. We have shows, activities… everything. It’s a busy place, and I need to be on top of things. These hiccups are making it very difficult. I’ve already had to reschedule a pool party because I couldn’t focus during the meeting.
DOCTOR: And you've tried… anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Everything my grandmother taught me, and then some things I found online! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, sugar, lemon… even scaring myself. Nothing seems to work for more than a minute or two, if that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to panic a little. It’s just… ongoing.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the hiccups, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No chest pain, no stomach trouble, no dizziness. Just… the hiccups. I’m a little tired, but that’s probably from not sleeping well. It’s hard to get comfortable when you’re jolting with every other breath, you know? And I have a bit of a headache, but I get those sometimes anyway. Nothing unusual besides this.
DOCTOR: Do you have any… significant medical history?
PATIENT: Significant? Well… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist a few years back. Nothing major. I used to get migraines pretty badly, but those have calmed down a lot. Other than that… no. I'm not on any regular medications, if that's what you mean. Oh! And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything. I love food, you see. Especially Egyptian food, of course! But it’s hard to enjoy it when you’re constantly… hic! …interrupted.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s just… have a listen to your chest, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. No obvious abnormalities. You said you haven't experienced any weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no changes at all. I… actually, I might have gained a little weight recently. I do enjoy my food, as I mentioned. It's definitely not that. I’m eating perfectly normally, maybe even too much sometimes. It’s just… frustrating that something so simple is causing so much trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s likely… idiopathic. It often resolves on its own. Try some relaxation techniques. And avoid carbonated beverages. I'll write you a referral for a gastroenterologist, just in case. Though, frankly, I doubt they'll find anything.
PATIENT: Idiopathic? What does that mean, exactly? And a gastroenterologist? Is that… serious? I just thought it was a really stubborn case of hiccups. Is it something I should be worried about? Perhaps something to do with my stomach?
DOCTOR: It means we don’t know the cause. It's…common. And a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. No cause. Just… happens. But… for three days? It seems a long time for "just happens," doesn't it? And the gastroenterologist… is it worth the trouble, really? I have a lot on my plate, you see, with the resort and everything. I’m just worried it’s something more serious, and that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be serious. But it’s best to rule things out. Here's the referral. They'll likely do some basic tests. I wouldn’t worry too much. And if it doesn’t resolve within a week, then you can consider further investigation. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. A week. I suppose I can manage a week. No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if you don't think it’s anything serious. It’s just… hic! … very annoying. I hope it goes away soon.
DOCTOR: Right. Good day.
