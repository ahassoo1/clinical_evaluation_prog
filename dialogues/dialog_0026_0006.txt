DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come get it checked. It happened a few times now.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood… that is concerning, and you did the right thing coming in. Just to clarify, how much blood are we talking about?
PATIENT: Um… it is not a lot. Not like… a big amount. More like… streaks, maybe? Mixed in with the… the mucus when I cough. It is hard to explain. It is not every cough, just sometimes. And it makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks of blood mixed with mucus, not with every cough. That helps. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about a week ago? I thought it was just a bad cough at first, like a cold. But then I saw the blood and… well, I got worried. It has happened maybe three or four times in the last week. I do not remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week ago, coinciding with what you thought was a cold. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside the cough – fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No… no fever or chills. I have not felt short of breath, and no chest pain. I think I have… lost a little bit of appetite, maybe? But I am not sure if that is just because I am worried. Everything tastes… bland right now. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite and a decreased sense of taste, alongside the cough and blood. Have you been taking anything for the cough – over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. I tried some cough drops, the menthol ones. And I took some… over-the-counter cold medicine, with… decongestant? I do not remember the name. It did not seem to help much, to be honest. Just made me a little sleepy. I stopped taking it a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a reaction to any medicine before. I do not have any… food allergies either. I can eat anything. I do not have any… pets, or anything like that to be allergic to. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important to rule things out. No known allergies is good to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Um… well, I had pneumonia a long time ago, when I was younger. Maybe… twenty years ago? I had to be in the hospital for a few days. And… my husband… he passed away last year. But that was not… medical. He had a heart problem. I have been mostly healthy since the pneumonia.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. And pneumonia twenty years ago… okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I have never had any surgeries. Just the usual… check-ups and things. Nothing major. I try to stay healthy. I walk every day, and I eat… mostly healthy foods. I worry about my health, you see. Especially now with this cough. It is very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jeannemarie. It is unsettling to cough up blood. And it's good that you're proactive about your health. Now, do you have any family history of lung problems – things like asthma, bronchitis, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had… emphysema, I think? He smoked for many years. And my grandmother… she had some kind of breathing trouble when she was old. But I do not know what it was exactly. No one else that I know of… had any lung problems. I never smoked myself. I always stayed away from cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of emphysema in your father and some breathing trouble in your grandmother. And you’ve never smoked, which is excellent. One last question about your lifestyle: do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. I do not drink alcohol. And I do not use any… recreational drugs. Never have. I am a very… plain person. I like to walk and read. I do not really… go out much. I prefer to stay home. It is… safer. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly okay, Jeannemarie. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, do what you need to do. I just want to know what is wrong. It is very… unsettling, this cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit back and take some deep breaths for me. I’m going to listen to your lungs on both sides, front and back. I hear some… mild wheezing on both sides, but nothing too significant at this point. Your heart sounds regular. Now, could you take a deep breath and hold it while I listen again?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It feels… a little tight in my chest. Is that normal? I am trying not to worry, but it is difficult. It always feels… scary when something is wrong with my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your breathing sounds a little labored, but not severely. I don't hear any crackling or other concerning sounds. Your chest does feel a little tight, which you’ve already noticed. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. It's reading 96%, which is good. That’s within the normal range. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to check your throat and look in your ears. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. 96%… that is good, isn't it? That is reassuring. My throat feels… a little scratchy, maybe? But nothing too bad. I do not have any… ear pain or anything. I just want to know what is causing this cough. It is very worrying.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but nothing alarming. No visible sores or significant swelling. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it's possible this could be a lingering post-viral cough, perhaps with some mild bronchitis. However, coughing up blood always warrants further investigation. I want to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or other lung abnormalities. I also want to do a sputum test to check for any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. A chest X-ray and a… sputum test. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I understand. I just want to know what is wrong. It is very frightening to cough up blood. I do not want it to be anything… serious. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? The X-ray, I mean.
DOCTOR: The X-ray won’t hurt at all, Jeannemarie. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds. The technician will give you a lead apron to protect you from radiation. As for the sputum test, you'll just need to cough up a sample of mucus into a container. It might take a few tries, but it’s not painful. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them together. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and avoid smoking or any irritants. If the coughing worsens, or you experience any fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. 24 to 48 hours. I will try to be patient. Plenty of rest and fluids… I can do that. And I will avoid anything that might irritate my lungs. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… kind. I feel a little better knowing that you are looking into it. And if it gets worse… I will come back immediately. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. I understand your anxiety, and I’m here to help. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-ray and give you instructions for the sputum test. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have answered all of my questions. I just… I hope it is nothing serious. But I trust your judgement, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Jeannemarie. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
