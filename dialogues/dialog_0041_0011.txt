DOCTOR: Good morning, Armando. I'm Dr. Polczynski. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor, is it? Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed. Something about... a procedure. Cosmetic. My nephew said I needed clearance. He handles my things, you understand. Don't recall the details myself. Just want it done and over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No problem at all, Armando. Let’s see if we can get this sorted out quickly for you. Just pulling up your information here… cosmetic procedure, you said?
PATIENT: That's right. Look, I'm a busy man. Radio towers don't fix themselves, you know. And this heat... terrible for the equipment. Just need the form. What do you need from me? Don't need a life story, I hope.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Armando. It’s just standard procedure for me to ask a few questions before signing off on anything, even for cosmetic things. Helps make sure everything's safe and… well, appropriate. It doesn't have to be a life story, I promise. Just a few details about your health, okay?
PATIENT: Health? What about my health? I been climbin' those towers for forty years. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Never been sick a day in my life... well, maybe a little sniffle now and then. But nothing serious. Look, are you going to sign the paper or not? I got work to do. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I hear you. Just let me ask a quick couple of questions. Just to be sure. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions at all – anything like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… Doctor, I told you, I'm a healthy man. But… Old Man Tiber, he had somethin' with his pressure. Real bad. Kept fallin' asleep on the job. Not me, though! Never that. And… I think my sister, bless her soul, she had the sugar sickness. But that was years ago. Me? No. Perfectly fine. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and diabetes. That’s good to know, Armando. And you haven’t been personally diagnosed with either of those?
PATIENT: No! I haven't been diagnosed with anything, Doctor. I keep telling you! I work with electricity, dangerous heights, all sorts of things. If I was sick, I wouldn't be workin'! Now, is this form signed or what? I got a tower in the city that's been down all mornin'. People need their phones, you know. This is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando, I understand your urgency. Just one last quick thing, then I’ll see what I can do. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no. Why would I need medications? I told you, I'm a strong man! I drink my coffee, eat a biscuit now and then. That’s it. Coffee. That's all. Now, can we please get this over with? This is ridiculous. My nephew is gonna be furious if I'm late getting back.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Just coffee and biscuits. Okay… now, just to clarify, you said this is for a cosmetic procedure. Do you mind telling me what that procedure is?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor? I have no idea. My nephew said it was... somethin' about my face. Said it would make me look younger. He handles all that. I just wanted a paper signed. Look, is this some kind of trick? You tryin' to get me to admit somethin'? I just want to look presentable for a reunion, that’s all. Don't know the specifics. And frankly, I don't want to know. Sign the paper or don't. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand you're not sure about the details, and that's alright. But it's important for me to have some idea of what we’re signing off on. It helps ensure your safety. If you don't know what the procedure is, perhaps we should call your nephew?
PATIENT: Call him?! Absolutely not! He'll be furious. He's a very important man, always busy. No, no calls. Look, Doctor, are you a doctor or are you an interrogator? I'm tellin' ya, I just want the paper signed. It's a face thing. A little somethin' to fix a few wrinkles. That's it! Just a little touch-up. Now, is that enough information or do I need to find another doctor? I'm wastin' my valuable time here! .
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand your frustration. But I still need a little more information. A "face thing" could be anything from a simple cream to a surgical procedure. And without knowing exactly what it is, I can't responsibly sign off on it. It’s not about questioning you, it’s about making sure you're safe. Perhaps... let's do a quick check-up. Just basic vitals, listen to your heart and lungs. That way I can at least make sure you're healthy enough for something… and maybe, just maybe, we can jog your memory about the procedure while we talk?
