DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good that you're feeling well, but even without symptoms, high blood pressure is something we want to take seriously. The nurse mentioned high blood pressure readings. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first found out about it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. It was at my husband’s work thing. They do those health screenings for the employees and their spouses. It was…last month, maybe? I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. It’s just a number, right?
DOCTOR: It is just a number, in some ways, but it's a number that can tell us a lot about your overall health. And it's good we caught it. Do you happen to remember anything about what the reading was, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: No. They just told me it was “a little high” and to see a doctor. Like I’m doing now. Honestly, it felt like a waste of time until…well, my husband made me. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good your husband is looking out for you. And it’s definitely not a waste of time to get it checked out. It's common for people to feel fine even with high blood pressure, which is why regular check-ups are important. To get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your health history and lifestyle. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…let’s get this over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Never. I eat pretty healthy, considering. Mostly. And I’m not overweight. Look at me.
DOCTOR: You do look very healthy, Ms. Dudney. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I had my tonsils out when I was little, a long time ago. But that’s it. Really. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Mostly healthy my whole life. This blood pressure thing is…weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Tonsillectomy in childhood is helpful to have on the record. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My grandma, on my mom’s side… she had something with her heart, I think. She was pretty old when it happened. And my uncle, my mom’s brother, he’s kinda… heavy. They always said he needed to watch his diet, but he didn’t listen. That’s about it. They weren’t big on going to the doctor, my family. Old-fashioned, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Family history of heart issues and weight problems is good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My husband smokes, unfortunately, but I make him go outside. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. That’s it. I try to be healthy, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol is excellent. Alright, Ms. Dudney, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. Seriously. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I can eat anything. My husband always jokes I have an iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky, like I said. Can we just get this over with? I have a garden to tend to, you know. Tomatoes don’t weed themselves.
DOCTOR: You certainly sound fortunate. Alright, let's move on to the physical exam then. It will just be a standard check-up: I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. We'll also take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…don’t take too long. And try not to poke around too much. I don’t like being touched.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. ...Okay, that’s 148 over 92. A bit elevated, as expected. Let's listen to your heart now. Your heartbeat is regular, but a little bit strong. I don’t hear any murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your eyes...
PATIENT: Look, is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back home. And could you maybe explain what a “murmur” is? It sounds…bad. My husband always says doctors use too many fancy words.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize if I’m moving too slowly. I want to be thorough, but I'll try to be quicker. A murmur is just an extra whooshing sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It's not always a sign of a problem, but it’s something we want to investigate further, just to be safe. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong right now. Okay, your throat looks clear. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’m just going to feel your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Pulses are strong and regular. I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test, just to get a better picture of your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and overall health. And, because your blood pressure is elevated, I'd also recommend an electrocardiogram to check your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Look, can’t you just give me something for the blood pressure? A pill or something? My friend takes something for hers, and she says it works wonders. I really don’t want to spend all day in a doctor’s office getting poked and prodded. This is ridiculous. Honestly. And what exactly does an “electrocardio…thingy” do? It sounds…painful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I wish I could just prescribe you a medication right now. However, it’s important to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before starting any treatment. Simply masking the symptom without knowing the cause could be harmful. The blood work and urine test will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your high blood pressure. An electrocardiogram, or ECG, is a completely painless test. We simply attach a few small, sticky pads to your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles or discomfort. It’s quick and provides valuable information about your heart health. I want to work with you to get to the bottom of this and find the best solution for your health. I promise I'll explain everything thoroughly and answer any questions you have. Would you be willing to consider getting these tests done?
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m not spending all day here. I have things to do. And if it’s going to involve needles, you better tell me beforehand. I hate needles. And I want a full explanation of everything afterwards. No fancy doctor words. Understand? And can’t you just write down what I need to do? I don’t want to forget anything. Honestly. This is just…a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. No needles without warning, clear explanations, and a written summary of everything we discuss. I promise. Okay, so here’s what we’ll do. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health. And we'll do the ECG right here in the office – it only takes about 10-15 minutes. The nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample before you leave. She’ll explain the process thoroughly. The ECG technician will attach the pads and run the test. Here’s a list of everything we discussed, and the nurse will give you a separate sheet with detailed preparation instructions for the blood work and urine test. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And don’t expect me to understand all this fancy medical stuff. Honestly, I just want to go home. And please tell the nurse to be gentle with the needles. I swear, if she hurts me… .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse is very experienced and gentle, and I’ll let her know your concerns. I’ll also make sure to explain everything clearly when we discuss the results next week. Let me call the nurse to get things started. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Dudney. We'll get to the bottom of this together. .
