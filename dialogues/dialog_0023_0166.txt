DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I've been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it's become… noticeable enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s primarily in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a little tingling in my right as well.
DOCTOR: Numbness, you say. And it’s primarily in the left leg… tingling in the right as well. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now. It was very intermittent at first – just a fleeting sensation here and there. But over the last few weeks, it’s become more frequent and… sustained, if that makes sense. It doesn’t go away completely anymore, even if it lessens at times.
DOCTOR: Sustained, alright. And can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to put into words. It’s not a sharp pain, certainly. More like… a loss of feeling. Like my leg is… muffled. Sometimes it feels cold, even when it isn't. And occasionally, like I mentioned, a little bit of pins and needles. It’s most prominent in my calf, I believe, but it does travel up towards my knee and sometimes even into my thigh. It's not constant throughout the entire leg, but those are the areas it affects most. Does that clarify things?
DOCTOR: Muffled… cold sensation… pins and needles, radiating up the leg. Yes, that’s… helpful. And has anything specific brought it on, or made it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I’ve been trying to pinpoint a trigger, but I haven’t had much luck. I do a fair amount of walking and standing for my work – special effects and animation often involves setting up equipment and moving things around. But I haven’t noticed a direct correlation with particularly strenuous activity. I did spend a lot of time sitting while finishing a project in late July, though. Perhaps that could be a factor? I don't know. I haven't changed anything in my diet recently, or started any new medications.
DOCTOR: Walking, standing, prolonged sitting… no dietary changes, no new medications. Hmm. And are you experiencing any weakness in your leg, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s something I have noticed, actually. It’s subtle, but sometimes my left leg feels… less responsive, I suppose. Not like I’m going to fall over or anything. More like it takes a little more effort to lift it, or to maintain my balance when I’m standing for a long time. I usually don’t think much of it, and I’ve been attributing it to fatigue from work, but now that you mention it… yes, I suppose there is some weakness. It’s not severe, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel or bladder function? No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems to be… normal, if that's the right word. I haven’t had any issues in that regard, no. Is that… a common symptom? I apologize if that's a bit of a personal question.
DOCTOR: It's a necessary question, Mr. Kinjerski. Just ruling things out. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I've been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I do have a fairly good family history, if that’s helpful. My parents are both in good health, and my grandparents lived long lives. No history of nerve problems or anything similar, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: No prior medical conditions, no surgeries, good family history… That’s… reasonable. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't take anything regularly. I occasionally use ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. Very infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month. And no supplements at all. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep, so I haven’t felt the need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don’t mind. We’ll start with neurological assessment, check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in both legs. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie supine. Right patellar reflex… 2 plus. Achilles reflex… 2 plus. Left patellar reflex… 1 plus. Achilles reflex… diminished. Now, let’s test your muscle strength. Can you resist me as I apply pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Dorsiflexion… 5 out of 5 on the right, 4 out of 5 on the left. Plantarflexion… 5 out of 5 on the right, 4 out of 5 on the left. Knee extension… 5 out of 5 bilaterally. Hip flexion… 5 out of 5 bilaterally. Sensation to light touch… intact bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick… diminished in the L5 dermatome on the left. Now, I want you to sit up and perform a heel-to-shin test. Place the heel of one foot on the opposite knee and slide it down the shin. Let's start with the right leg.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. No problem on this side. Now the left… I may struggle a bit, given what we’ve already discussed.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… as expected. Noticeable ataxia on the left. Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. That’s sufficient for now. Based on the examination findings – diminished reflexes, weakness, decreased sensation in the L5 dermatome, and ataxia – it appears there is likely some nerve compression or irritation affecting the left leg. However, to determine the precise cause and location, we’ll need to order some further testing. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine and electromyography to evaluate the nerve function. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: An MRI and an EMG… No, I don't believe I do, Doctor. Though I confess, I’m not familiar with either of those procedures. What exactly do they involve? And are they… painful? I'm a little anxious, to be honest. I was hoping it wasn't something too serious.
DOCTOR: An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the structures within your spine. It’s non-invasive, though you’ll need to lie very still inside the machine for about 30-45 minutes. It can be a little… claustrophobic for some people, but we can discuss options if that’s a concern. The EMG, on the other hand, involves inserting a small needle into certain muscles to measure electrical activity. It can be mildly uncomfortable, like a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be overly painful. The results will help us identify if there’s any nerve damage and pinpoint the exact location of the compression. As for the seriousness, it’s too early to say definitively. It could be a simple nerve impingement, or it could be something more significant. That’s why we need these tests. I'll also order bloodwork to rule out any systemic causes. Do not attempt any strenuous activity until we have the results. That could worsen the condition. I’ll have my nurse schedule the tests for you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No strenuous activity. MRI and EMG… and bloodwork. And it's possible it could be more serious… I appreciate your candor. I will certainly avoid any activities that might aggravate it. Thirty to forty-five minutes inside a machine… I suppose I'm a little worried about the claustrophobia, but we can discuss options as you said. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. When can I expect to hear back with the results?
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to process the bloodwork. The MRI and EMG results will likely take a little longer, perhaps a week after the procedures are completed. My nurse will contact you as soon as they are available. I’ll also prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help alleviate any discomfort in the meantime. Please follow the dosage instructions carefully. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe pain, weakness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction – contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your thorough examination. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions and contact the office if anything changes. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Stop.
