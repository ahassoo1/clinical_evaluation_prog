DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bahta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lonell Bahta. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Osga, if I recall correctly? I was told you handle these… certifications for care at home. My daughter, she explained it to me. A bit confusing, all of it.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Osga. Look, I haven't got all day. Certifications… paperwork, mostly. What exactly are you here for?
PATIENT: Ah, forgive me for taking your time, Doctor. My daughter, Camille, she believes I might be… eligible for some assistance. She says it would allow me to receive care at my home. I had a… a rather significant surgery not too long ago, and recovery has been… slow. She worries, you see. I am quite independent, but she insists. Is this what you assess? The need for help at home?
DOCTOR: Surgery… Right. And what kind of surgery was it?
PATIENT: It was to repair a… a blockage. In my intestine, I believe. It was quite serious, requiring a rather lengthy hospital stay. The doctor, Dr. Laurent, he performed it at Sainte-Marie Hospital. It was… March 14th, I believe. A very precise date, as I recall. I had to have a… a colostomy, temporarily, and that was reversed just last month. It has left me… weaker than before, you see. And easily tired.
DOCTOR: March… Okay, let's just pull up your records. Sainte-Marie… Hmm. Yes, here we are. Intestinal obstruction, colostomy takedown… Alright. And what specifically is difficult for you now?
PATIENT: Difficult… Well, it is not one particular thing, Doctor. It is a… a gradual decline, really. I find simple chores… exhausting. Walking, even a short distance, leaves me breathless. And… preparing meals. The standing, the lifting… It is all quite draining. Before, I was very active, you see. I enjoyed gardening, walking the dogs… Now, I mostly rest. Camille worries about my nutrition, as well. I do not have much appetite.
DOCTOR: So, you’re tired. You have less appetite. And chores are… difficult. Right. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: No, not dizziness, Doctor. Not precisely. It is more… a feeling of profound weakness. And sometimes… a slight tremor in my hands. It is not constant, but it is noticeable. Especially when I attempt to… to write, for example. It makes even simple tasks… frustrating. I assure you, I have always had a steady hand. Before the surgery, that is. It is the fatigue, I believe, that causes it. And the weakness, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Blood pressure... 120 over 78. Pulse is... 72. A little low, but not alarming. Any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no history of heart problems whatsoever. My general health was quite good before the surgery, to be frank. I always had regular check-ups with Dr. Dubois, my family physician. He always said my heart was… robust. It is only since the surgery… and the recovery… that I have experienced these… difficulties. I assure you, these symptoms are new. I never had any trouble with my blood pressure before, either.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Okay. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am taking… Pantoprazole, for my stomach, as the surgery upset my digestion considerably. And a small dose of… Lorazepam, for anxiety. Camille insisted on that, as I was… quite distressed after returning home. It helps me sleep, mostly. Just a small dose, mind you. And I take a daily multivitamin, as Camille worries about my nutrition. That is all, I believe. Nothing for my heart, or blood pressure. Dr. Dubois approved the Lorazepam, as well. He knows Camille worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. Anxiety, indigestion... Right. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to speak of. Not to medications, or foods, or… anything. Never have. I am rather fortunate in that regard. Camille, she has several, but I have always been… quite robust, as I mentioned before. A healthy constitution, I believe. It is rather perplexing, this sudden decline in my strength. Before the surgery, I was active, robust… and now… well, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I need to examine you, briefly. Just a quick assessment of your strength and reflexes. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Although, forgive me if I am a little… unsteady. It is the weakness, you see. It comes and goes. But yes, I can stand. Just… slowly, please. And perhaps I should hold onto something?
DOCTOR: Okay, just… try to walk a few steps for me. Nice and slow. And tell me if you feel dizzy.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… a little unsteady, as you can see. And I am breathing… rather heavily. The fatigue… it comes quickly. Just a few more steps, I suppose. Perhaps I should stop here, Doctor? I do not want to… fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Stop. Your gait is… somewhat impaired. Weakness in both legs. Reflexes… diminished, but present. Look, Mr. Bahta, to be frank, you're not in great shape. But honestly, that's not surprising after a major surgery. It sounds like you're experiencing some post-operative deconditioning and anxiety.
PATIENT: Ah. I… understand, Doctor. Post-operative… deconditioning. Camille used that word as well. It is… disheartening to hear, of course. But I suppose… realistic. So, what does that mean, exactly? Does that mean I am… eligible for assistance at home? Would that help with… the fatigue, and the weakness? Camille is very concerned about me being alone, you see. And preparing meals… it is becoming quite difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, you do appear to require some assistance. I'm going to recommend a referral to a physical therapist for a course of rehabilitation. And I can authorize a limited amount of home health care - a nurse to check in a few times a week, and maybe some assistance with meal preparation. But frankly, you need to work at this. The physical therapy is crucial. Don't just sit around waiting for things to get better. This will require pre-authorization from your insurance, of course. It’s a process. This is the referral. Take it to the physical therapy department. And I'll get the home health paperwork started. Anything else?
PATIENT: Ah, very good, Doctor. That sounds… quite reasonable. Physical therapy… yes, I suppose I can manage that. And home health care… that would be a great relief to Camille, and to me, of course. Pre-authorization… yes, I understand. My insurance is… private. Should there be any problems, I can provide the necessary information. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very helpful. And reassuring. No, I believe that is all. Thank you again for your time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any problems. Next! .
