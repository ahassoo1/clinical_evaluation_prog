DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Rosanova, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve just been getting the chills lately. It’s a bit weird, honestly. Not like a fever chill, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, “just cold.” Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started maybe a week ago? It comes and goes, and it’s not always all over. Sometimes it's just my arms, sometimes my legs, and then other times it feels like my whole body is freezing. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s enough to make me grab a sweater, even if it’s warm in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week ago, comes and goes, affects different parts of your body…and makes you feel like you need a sweater even when you shouldn’t. Do you notice anything specifically that triggers these chills, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don't think so. I mean, I haven't been able to connect it to anything specific. I’ve been working a lot, so maybe stress? But honestly, work stress is pretty normal for me, so I don’t know if that’s it. It just…happens. I was hoping it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, and it’s not getting better on its own. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. I haven't had a cough or a sore throat, no aches or pains. I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn't tired these days? I guess… maybe a little more thirsty than usual? But that could just be the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, sore throat, aches, or pains. A little more tired and thirsty, but those could be explained by other things. Just to be thorough, are you experiencing any changes in your appetite, any weight loss or gain, or any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Oh, wow, you're really thorough! Okay… my appetite’s been normal, I think. No weight loss, definitely not. If anything, I’ve been maybe eating a little more comfort food lately, haha. And no changes down there, thankfully. Everything’s pretty regular, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, measles, all that. But nothing major. I did have a really bad bout of the flu a couple years ago, but that’s it. Oh! And I had a pretty bad sprained ankle last year, but that healed up fine. Nothing chronic, definitely. Are you looking for anything specific?
DOCTOR: No, just trying to get a complete picture. Any surgeries ever?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get some exercise when I can… you know, the usual. Does this sound like anything to you, Dr. Rosanova? I'm starting to get a little worried I'm coming down with something weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, and you generally try to stay healthy. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. It could be a lot of things, Jailenne. Given your symptoms and history, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule a few things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, really. I just want to figure out what's going on. Is there anything I should do to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your lymph nodes. It will only take a few minutes. First, let's take your temperature. Normal. 98.6. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Lungs sound clear. Any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: No asthma, thankfully. And no allergies that I know of. I mean, I sneeze sometimes, but who doesn’t? My dad had hay fever, but I seem to have dodged that bullet. I'm a little ticklish, though, just warning you.
DOCTOR: Noted. I’ll be gentle. Okay, these feel normal as well. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I try to get everything from my diet. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I figure if I'm eating okay, I should be fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And lastly, do you have any family history of autoimmune diseases, thyroid problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… My grandma on my mom’s side had something with her thyroid, I think. She was always tired and gained a lot of weight. And my aunt has rheumatoid arthritis, which is…an autoimmune thing, right? That’s about all I can think of, really. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of thyroid problems in your grandmother and rheumatoid arthritis in your aunt. That’s helpful information. Given your symptoms, family history, and the physical exam, I think it’s worth doing some blood work to rule out a few things, like thyroid issues and some common inflammatory markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. Better to be safe than sorry, right? What exactly will the blood work show? And will I need to fast or anything before?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll check your thyroid hormone levels, complete blood count, and some inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP. These tests can help us identify if there’s any underlying inflammation or thyroid dysfunction. No, you don’t need to fast. You can eat and drink normally before the tests. We'll just need a standard blood draw. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. It’s a pretty standard panel, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, if your chills get worse, or if you develop a fever, cough, or any other new symptoms, please call the clinic immediately. Does that all sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. I appreciate you being so thorough. So, just go to the lab whenever I have time? Do I need to make an appointment or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. You don’t need an appointment. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. The address and phone number are on the form. I'll also have the results sent directly to my office. Once we have the results back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing we're getting it checked out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon. Take care!
