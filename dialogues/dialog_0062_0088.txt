DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I've been getting this ringing in my ears, you know? It's been happening for a little while now and it's starting to bug me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears… that’s also called tinnitus. And you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… a couple of months? It comes and goes, but it's definitely more often now. It's hard to explain... sometimes it's like a high-pitched whine, other times just a constant buzzing. It makes it hard to concentrate, especially at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, coming and going, and different types of sounds – a whine and a buzzing. And it’s impacting your concentration at work. That’s good to know. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly my right ear, but sometimes I hear it in both. It's not all the time in the left one though, just occasionally. It's really annoying when I'm trying to take orders at the restaurant.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly right ear, occasionally both. Working in a restaurant can be pretty noisy, I imagine. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Loud noises, for sure. Like, if there's a lot of shouting or music playing, it gets really bad. And… sometimes when I’m stressed, it seems to get worse too. I got divorced a few months ago, so… things have been a bit hectic, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Loud noises and stress seem to be triggers. And I’m sorry to hear about the divorce, that is a lot to deal with. Have you had any hearing loss that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mean, working in a restaurant, it is loud, but I haven't noticed anything different about my hearing exactly. People still talk normally to me, and I can hear everything alright. I haven't had any trouble hearing conversations or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known hearing loss. Have you been experiencing any dizziness, fullness in your ears, or any pain along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No dizziness, definitely not. And… no pain, no. Sometimes my ear feels a little… blocked, maybe? Like when you get water in your ear, but not painful. Just a little… stuffy. It doesn’t last long though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or pain, just occasional ear fullness. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bad flu last year, but I got over it. Nothing else, no. I'm pretty healthy, I think. I eat alright, try to get some exercise when I can, but work keeps me busy. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And yes, knowing you have private insurance is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. Not that I can remember anyway. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was years ago and it healed up fine. Nothing major, definitely no surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Uh… my mum has a bit of trouble with her blood pressure, but other than that, everyone's pretty healthy. I don't think anyone else has problems with their ears or anything like that. I'm originally from Fiji, if that's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mum with blood pressure, otherwise healthy. And thank you for letting me know you're originally from Fiji. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. Work is stressful enough without that!
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine, no smoking or drugs. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… the occasional Panadol if I get a headache. That’s it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I’d rather just rest if I’m feeling unwell. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this ringing to stop. It's really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional Panadol. I understand – it's frustrating when something like this is interfering with your life. Okay, let’s do a quick exam. I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we’ll do a quick hearing test just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Anything to figure out what's going on. Please, go ahead. I just want to get back to normal, you know? Work is hard enough without this constant buzzing in my ears. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let’s start with your right ear. I’m just going to gently insert this instrument to take a look. …Hmm. Your ear canal looks clear, no signs of wax buildup or infection. The eardrum looks normal as well. And the left ear looks clear too. Everything appears visually normal. Now, let’s do a quick hearing test. I’m going to put these headphones on you, and you just let me know when you hear a sound, no matter how faint. It’s a simple test, and it won't take long. Okay, sounds like your hearing is within normal limits for most frequencies... though there is a slight dip at the higher frequencies in your right ear, which could correlate with the ringing you're experiencing. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tinnitus, and it's possible it's related to noise exposure and stress. The slight dip in your high-frequency hearing in your right ear supports that, but further testing would be needed to be sure. We have a few options.
