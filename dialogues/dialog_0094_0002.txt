DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. I see you’re 87 years young. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Yes, 87... feels like yesterday, honestly! Um... well, it’s… going to the bathroom. It's a bit hard now. Not like it used to be. I have to… push a little. Does that make sense? I forget things easily, so I hope I'm explaining it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with bowel movements. “Pushing a little” is a very clear way to describe it. And don't worry about forgetting things; it’s perfectly normal, and I’m happy to help you clarify anything. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, when did it start… hmm. That’s a tough one. It wasn’t sudden, not like bang, all of a sudden hard. It’s been… getting worse, I think, for… maybe a few months now? Or was it longer? I really can’t say for sure. My memory… it’s not what it once was. My husband, he probably remembers better. He usually notices these things before I do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. It's very common for changes like this to develop gradually, and it’s perfectly alright if you aren't certain of the exact timeline. A few months is a helpful starting point. Could you describe what the stool looks like when you are able to go?
PATIENT: Oh dear... that's a bit personal, isn't it? Well, it's... not normal, I guess. It’s… hard. Like little pebbles. And sometimes… sometimes it’s very thin. Not like it used to be, nice and… well, you know. Just not right. Sorry to be so… vague. It's embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Stoffregen, and please don't apologize. These are important details, and I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss. "Hard, like little pebbles" and "very thin" are very helpful descriptions. Have you noticed any blood when you go to the bathroom, or any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I don't think so. Not that I remember. I always check, you know, just to be sure… but nothing. And pain… not really. Maybe a little straining, that’s all. It just feels… like I’m not getting everything out, if that makes sense? Like there's still something left. It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s more tiring than painful, really. I get worn out trying.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. No blood and no sharp pain are good things to hear. The sensation of incomplete evacuation and the tiredness you feel are important details as well. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My heart, the doctor said it’s a little weak. I take a pill for that. And… I had my hip replaced years ago. That was a success, thankfully. I used to walk miles, but not so much anymore. And… diabetes, I think? Something with sugar? I take another pill for that, every morning. I see a lot of doctors, you know, getting old is… complicated. I probably forget half of them! My husband keeps track of everything. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, Ms. Stoffregen, and it’s completely understandable that keeping track of everything can be difficult. So, to clarify, you have a history of a weak heart, a previous hip replacement, and diabetes. Do you remember the names of the medications you take for your heart and diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names? No, I don't think so. I just take the little pills every morning. They’re different colours, you know? One is white and round, and the other one is… pinkish, I think. And small. I have a little pill organizer, my husband fills it up for me every week. I wouldn’t know what they are called, I just take them. Sorry to be so useless. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: You are not useless at all, Ms. Stoffregen. Many people have difficulty remembering medication names, and it's perfectly fine. It's very helpful that you know the colours and that your husband manages the pill organizer. I’m going to take a quick look at your electronic health record to get a better understanding of your medications and other medical history. Just one moment. Okay, I see here you’re taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure, which is related to your heart condition, and Metformin for your diabetes. Is that consistent with what you were describing?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… Metformin? Yes, those sound right. That’s probably it. My husband always makes sure I get the right ones. He’s a lifesaver, truly. He reads all the little papers the doctors give me, I just… take the pills. I get confused easily, you know? All the different names… it’s too much for me sometimes. He says I shouldn’t worry about the names, just take them as prescribed. He’s very careful.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you have such a supportive husband, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s very reassuring to know you have someone looking after your medications. Now, just a few more questions before we move on. Have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I used to, when I was younger, but now… not so much. I think I’ve been eating pretty much the same. Maybe a little less, now that I’m tired more easily, I don't feel hungry as often. But I haven’t tried to lose weight. I think I’m about the same as always. I don't really pay attention to the scale anymore. It just makes me sad, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. It's perfectly alright if you haven't been weighing yourself. And it makes sense that it wouldn’t be a priority if it's upsetting. One last question for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don't think so. Nothing I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything… not that I remember. My husband says I sometimes get a little itchy when I eat shellfish, but it’s not a serious allergy, he says. Just a little bit of a rash. Nothing life-threatening. I don’t go out of my way to avoid anything, really. He handles all that, too. It sounds like he does everything! He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very attentive husband, Ms. Stoffregen, and it’s wonderful that he’s so involved in your healthcare. Just to clarify, a mild rash with shellfish, but no other known allergies. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and a quick rectal exam to assess the stool consistency. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? Well… I’ve had those before. They’re not… pleasant, are they? But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgement, dear. Just… please be gentle. And quick. It’s a bit embarrassing, you know. But if it will help figure out what’s wrong… then yes, alright. But gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I completely understand your hesitation, and I assure you I will be as gentle and as quick as possible. Your comfort is my top priority. We’ll take our time. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. The exam showed some mild tenderness when I pressed on your lower abdomen, and I was able to confirm that the stool is indeed hard and somewhat pebbly, consistent with what you described. I didn’t feel any masses or anything concerning. Your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you are experiencing constipation. It’s quite common, especially with age, and often related to diet, medication side effects, or decreased activity levels. However, given your age and the change in bowel habits, we want to rule out anything more serious. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out anemia. I’m also going to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood test and a stool test… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgement, dear. You’re the doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s tiring being so… backed up. And worrying about it doesn’t help. So yes, please, do the tests. And… will I need to do anything special to prepare for them? I don’t want to mess anything up. My husband will help me, but I like to know what’s expected.
DOCTOR: You are very kind, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad we can work together to figure this out. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning. As for the stool test, I’ll give you a kit with instructions on how to collect a small sample at home. It’s very straightforward, and we can go over the instructions together now or when you pick up the kit. In the meantime, while we wait for the test results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least 6-8 glasses of water a day. Also, try to incorporate more fiber-rich foods into your diet – things like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Gentle exercise, like walking, can also help stimulate bowel movements. I'm also going to recommend a stool softener, called Docusate Sodium, to start taking tonight. It will help make the stool easier to pass. I'll write you a prescription for that. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Docusate Sodium… no, I don't think so. I haven't had any reactions to anything before. My husband checks the medication labels, you know. He's very careful. And yes, please, write me a prescription for that. I'm willing to try anything to get some relief. Six to eight glasses of water… that sounds like a lot! But I’ll try. And more fruits and vegetables… I used to eat more of those when I was younger. This all sounds… sensible, I suppose. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad I could help. It’s wonderful that your husband is so involved and supportive. Here’s the prescription for the stool softener. You can pick it up at your local pharmacy. The label will have detailed instructions on how to take it. And here’s some information about increasing fluid intake and dietary fiber. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment with you in about a week to discuss the test results and see how you’re doing with the stool softener and dietary changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week from now… yes, that sounds good. I’ll make sure my husband puts it in the calendar. He keeps track of everything. And thank you, dear. For everything. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me, and I appreciate it. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything else you need to know? I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: You are not an old woman at all, Ms. Stoffregen, and it’s my pleasure to help. I appreciate your kind words. No, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just remember to follow the instructions on the stool softener and try to increase your fluid intake and fiber. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please contact me immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s my card with my contact information. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you in a week. In the meantime, take care of yourself and try to relax. Is there anything I can do to help you get set up before you leave?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think I’m alright. Just getting home safely is enough for now. My husband will be glad to see me, and we can go over everything together. He’ll make sure I don’t forget anything. You've been very kind and helpful, truly. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please give your husband my best, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care, and have a safe trip home. I’ll see you next week. .
