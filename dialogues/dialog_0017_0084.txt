DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been getting harder, I think. And my mouth feels very dry, as do my eyes. It’s been… a while now. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is not particularly helpful, Ms. Kobler. Vague symptoms require vague recollections, it seems. Let's attempt some precision. Has this been days, weeks, months?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You are right to ask. Months, I believe. Perhaps… four or five? It’s difficult to say. Things… aren’t always clear in my memory. I apologize. It feels like it’s gotten worse slowly, over time. It wasn't sudden.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this difficulty breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's not always hard to breathe. But when I walk, or even just… talk for a bit, it gets worse. It feels like I can't get enough air sometimes. And the dryness… that’s more consistent, I suppose. Always a little uncomfortable. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Slightly. Do you experience any wheezing or chest tightness with this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Wheezing… I don’t know if I do. I haven’t… really noticed. Chest tightness… sometimes, maybe? It’s more like a… pressure. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. I am sorry if I'm not being very clear. Do you mean a squeezing feeling? Like something is heavy on my chest?
DOCTOR: Let's try to avoid subjective descriptions, Ms. Kobler. Squeezing, heavy... These are not medical terms. Do you cough?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I do cough. Not… a lot, usually. More when I lie down, I think. It's a dry cough. Doesn’t bring anything up, if that makes sense. Just… a tickle in my throat that makes me cough. It hasn’t been… bad enough to keep me up at night, but it’s there. I hope that’s… better?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I haven’t really paid attention, Doctor. I suppose… maybe a little? I wear boots most of the time, so it's hard to tell. It hasn’t been anything significant, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed my shoes feeling tighter or anything. Would it be obvious if it were there? I am not very observant, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, it is your body. You should be observing it. Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have any. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, that I'm aware of. Though, I haven’t been exposed to many things, living where I do. Mostly just… fish, and trees. Do common allergies like pollen count? I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Adequate. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, Doctor. And sometimes, ibuprofen for aches and pains. Nothing regular, really. Just when I need it. I haven't been prescribed anything recently. And I don’t take anything for… this breathing problem. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Until today, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief examination. Please sit back and relax… if you can. I'll listen to your lungs and check your vital signs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I will try to relax. Though, I am not very good at that, truthfully. Please, just tell me if you need me to do anything. I will sit on the table, yes?
DOCTOR: Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there is diminished breath sounds in the bases. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 88 and regular. No murmurs or irregularities. Minimal pitting edema bilaterally. I'm going to have you stand up and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will try to breathe deeply. I am a little unsteady on my feet, so please let me know if I wobble. I am standing now. One deep breath… and another… Is this alright? I feel a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, you appear slightly pale. And your respiratory effort is increased. Minimal change in breath sounds with inspiration. Please, sit down, Ms. Kobler. We need to run some basic tests to ascertain the cause of your symptoms. I'll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. It’s possible this is a simple respiratory infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any family history of lung disease or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A chair sounds… good. Lung disease… I don't think so. My mother… she died when I was young. A fever, I believe. And my father… he was a fisherman. Always strong and healthy, as far as I know. He spent his life on the water. No heart problems that I am aware of. Though, we didn’t talk much about… health. It wasn’t something we discussed. I am sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Adequate. The results of these tests should be available within a few days. Until then, I recommend you increase your fluid intake and avoid strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen – difficulty breathing at rest, chest pain, or high fever – you are to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. More fluids and… rest. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I will remember that. It sounds… serious. Thank you for your time. Will I hear from your office to schedule a follow-up? Or should I call in a few days to check on the results? I don't want to be a bother, of course.
DOCTOR: My office will contact you with the results, Ms. Kobler. Do not call us; we will call you. And try to be more observant of your own health in the future. That will be all.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will wait for your call. Thank you again for your time. Have a good day. .
