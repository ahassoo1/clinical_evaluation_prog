DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, state the reason for your visit today. And try to be concise; my schedule is… demanding.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive. I apologize for the vagueness; it’s difficult to explain precisely when it started, or what might have caused it.
DOCTOR: “Disruptive,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I mean, Doctor. It’s… interfering with my work, and honestly, it’s a little worrisome. I find myself constantly needing to go, even when I don’t feel like I have to, if that makes sense. It’s just… frequent. Very frequent. I do apologize for not being more specific; it’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us attempt some specificity. When you say “frequent,” can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh dear. Um… let me think. Usually, I go perhaps… four or five times a day? Perhaps six on a busier day. But lately… it’s been more like every hour, or even more often. It's difficult to keep track, honestly. I haven't been… actively counting, if that makes sense. Is that helpful? I’m terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: Six times a day is… normal, Ms. MacVittie. Every hour is not. And "not counting" is… unhelpful. Do you experience any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no pain. Not at all. And definitely no burning. It’s… just the frequency. That’s the troubling part. It’s just… a constant urge, and then… well, then I go. And it’s not a small amount, either, if you don't mind my saying so. A normal amount, I suppose, but… often. I apologize for rambling. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately. Is it alright if I ask what you think it could be? Though, I understand if you prefer to examine me first.
DOCTOR: Speculation before examination is… unprofessional. Let us proceed with a brief medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, of course, sir. A medical history. That makes perfect sense. Please, do ask. I… I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so please bear with me if I struggle with details. I was divorced about five years ago, and I haven’t remarried. I work as a concierge, which, as I mentioned, is becoming rather difficult with… everything. I don't believe I have any significant allergies. And… let me see… I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries, to my recollection.
DOCTOR: No surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… that’s not entirely true. When I was a teenager, I had my tonsils removed. It was… quite a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, playing volleyball. But those were both very minor, I assure you. Nothing… significant. I haven’t been hospitalized in… well, decades. I apologize for the omissions. It’s just… a lot to recall. Is that important, Doctor? The wrist, I mean?
DOCTOR: Tonsils and a fractured wrist are… irrelevant. Family history. Any instances of kidney disease, bladder problems, or… unusual urinary habits in your family?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history. Right. That’s… a good question. My mother… she had rather frequent headaches, if I recall correctly. And my grandmother… on my father’s side… she was a bit… frail, in her later years. But I don’t believe either of them had any specific kidney or bladder issues. No, not that I'm aware of. My father… he was very healthy, actually, right up until the end. I… I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it alright if I ask… is this something serious, Doctor? I'm starting to feel quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Anxiety will not assist us. We are gathering information. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never have. I find it… rather unpleasant, actually. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week. And I drink plenty of water, especially given… the situation. But no smoking, certainly not. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite the… recent disruptions. Does that help? I apologize for being so vague; I truly am trying to be as forthcoming as possible.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not currently. I haven't needed to take any regular medications in… well, years. I occasionally use over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, but that's it. Just ibuprofen, or sometimes acetaminophen. Nothing prescribed, and nothing… long-term. I… I truly haven't been a frequent visitor to doctors, sir. This is rather unusual for me. Is there anything else I should mention? Perhaps about my diet? I do enjoy seafood, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will begin with abdominal palpation. And please, try to relax. It will be more efficient if you do.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Abdominal palpation. Of course. I shall try my best to relax, Doctor. Though I confess, I'm rather… apprehensive. Is it alright if I ask what you're looking for specifically? Just to… ease my mind, if possible.
DOCTOR: I am assessing for bladder distention and any tenderness suggestive of infection. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little, yes. Not… sharp, exactly. Just… a sort of pressure. It's… uncomfortable, but not terribly painful. It feels… a bit tender, as you said. It's difficult to describe. Is that… normal? Perhaps I'm just being sensitive. It’s just… I’m not accustomed to being touched in that area, Doctor. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness upon palpation of the suprapubic region. No rebound tenderness. Bladder is palpable, appears moderately distended. Now, I will listen to your abdomen. Please breathe normally.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Breathing normally. Yes. Is everything… as it should be, Doctor? I confess, I’m feeling quite… exposed. And a little anxious. Is there anything… concerning?
DOCTOR: Auscultation unremarkable. Bowel sounds present. Based on this limited examination, and your history, I suspect a simple urinary tract infection, possibly exacerbated by mild bladder irritability. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we require a urinalysis. A sample is needed. I will leave you with instructions and a collection cup. Please return with the sample within the hour. And try to remain calm. It is likely nothing serious.
PATIENT: Oh… a urinalysis. A urinary tract infection… Is that… easily treatable, Doctor? And the bladder irritability… is that something to be concerned about? I apologize for my persistence, but I am rather anxious, as you know. And… the instructions? Where will I find them? And… should I avoid drinking anything before the sample? I don't want to contaminate it, or… do anything incorrectly.
DOCTOR: The instructions are on the counter. Yes, avoid excessive fluid intake before the sample. And frankly, Ms. MacVittie, excessive worrying will not expedite the diagnosis. It's a simple infection. A common ailment. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
PATIENT: Oh… A simple infection… Instructions… I suppose I should just… follow the instructions. .
