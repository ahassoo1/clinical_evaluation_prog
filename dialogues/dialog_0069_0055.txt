DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I’m one of the internal medicine physicians here. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, I suppose I’m here because… frankly, I’ve heard things are becoming rather loose these days. My daughter suggested I look into this… medical marijuana. She says it's good for… well, she mentioned a few things. I'm not one to jump on bandwagons, you understand, but if it can actually help… I'd like to hear what you have to say about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. It's good that you're exploring options and talking to your daughter. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand if medical marijuana might be beneficial for you. Before we get into that specifically, could you tell me a little more about why your daughter suggested it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's the usual, Doctor. She says my… discomfort keeps me from doing things. My gardening, mostly. And I’m a bit restless at night, if you catch my drift. Honestly, it’s nothing a good night's sleep wouldn’t fix, but she insists it’s something more. She fusses so. She reads all sorts of things online, you know how young people are. I’ve managed perfectly well for seventy-four years without needing… this, but she’s quite persistent.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort that's affecting your activities, like gardening, and some trouble sleeping. And your daughter is concerned and suggested medical marijuana as a potential solution. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the discomfort a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… aches, Doctor. Just general aches. Mostly in my joints. My knees, my back, my hips… all the places that wear out after a lifetime of use, naturally. It’s not sharp pain, it's more of a… dull throbbing. And it’s worse when it's cold, or when I've been on my feet too long. Honestly, it's what comes with age. I don't expect you to work miracles, mind you. I just want to know if this… marijuana… is worth the trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull, throbbing aches in your knees, back, and hips – worse with cold weather or activity. That does sound like it could be related to osteoarthritis, which is quite common with age. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with anything like arthritis, or have you seen a doctor about these aches before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Good heavens, no. I’m not one for running to the doctor over every little twinge, Doctor. My mother always said fresh air and hard work were the best medicine. And I’ve lived by that for seventy-four years. I’ve had a family doctor, of course, but he mostly checked my blood pressure and told me to watch my salt intake. He never mentioned any… osteo-whatever-you-said. I managed just fine on my own, thank you very much. Until my daughter started filling my head with these ideas.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been managing well on your own for a long time, and you prefer a more natural approach. That’s perfectly valid. Just so I have a complete picture, have you tried any other treatments for the aches—like over-the-counter pain relievers, creams, or physical therapy—before now?
PATIENT: Oh, I've used a little liniment now and then. Rubbed it on my knees when they were particularly stiff. And I've taken some of those… ibuprofen pills when I had a bad headache. But honestly, they didn't do much. They just upset my stomach. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. That’s why I’m even considering this… alternative. Though I still maintain a healthy skepticism, you understand. It all seems a bit… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your skepticism. And it's good you've tried a few things, even if they didn't provide much relief. Ibuprofen can sometimes cause stomach upset. Now, thinking about other things going on with your health, do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor always said my blood pressure was a little… elevated. He put me on a small pill for it, years ago. I think it's a water pill, something like that. Nothing major. And I’ve been told I have a touch of… the sugar. But again, nothing that requires drastic measures. I watch what I eat, mostly. A sensible diet and a bit of exercise. I’m not one for sweets, you see. I don't like feeling sluggish. Other than that… no, I’m fairly robust for my age, thank you very much. I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure managed with a water pill, and a bit of elevated blood sugar that you manage with diet. That's helpful to know. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the water pill?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter insisted. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And I occasionally take a calcium tablet for my bones. Other than that… no. I prefer to keep things simple. I don't believe in loading up on pills and potions. It all seems a bit… unnecessary, if you ask me. A good night's sleep and a healthy appetite are what truly keep a person going, I always say.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So vitamin D and calcium supplements. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Yes, actually. A very long time ago. I had my gallbladder removed. It was quite a difficult recovery. And… I was hospitalized for a week with pneumonia when I was in my fifties. A nasty business, that. But I’ve been perfectly healthy ever since, thank you very much. I haven’t needed a hospital bed since then. And I certainly hope I don’t need one now. I detest hospitals. Far too many germs, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a case of pneumonia in the past. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, or any other major medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… aches and pains, I suppose. Similar to what I’m experiencing. She never went to the doctor, though. She just… soldiered on. My father had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away rather suddenly when I was young. And my brother… he developed diabetes later in life. He wasn't very careful with his diet, you see. A bit of a sweet tooth, that one. Other than that… no, not that I recall. It wasn’t something we discussed much in my family. We were more concerned with practical matters, you understand. Getting by, raising a family… things like that. Not fussing over ailments.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Family history of aches and pains, heart disease, and diabetes. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Certainly not. I have never touched a cigarette in my life, and I find alcohol… quite unpleasant, thank you very much. And as for… recreational drugs… the very thought! I was raised with a certain… decorum, you understand. Such things were never tolerated. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea before bed, thank you very much. It’s far more conducive to a good night’s sleep. I assure you, Doctor, I live a very… respectable life.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ellan. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, so to summarize, you’re a 74-year-old Dominican woman experiencing aches and pains in your knees, back and hips, with some trouble sleeping. You’ve managed these with limited success using liniments and over-the-counter pain relievers. You have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and blood sugar, which you manage with medication and diet. You take vitamin D and calcium supplements, and have a history of gallbladder removal and pneumonia. You have a family history of aches and pains, heart disease, and diabetes, and you live a very healthy lifestyle. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. My bones aren’t quite as sturdy as they used to be, you understand. And do hurry, if you don’t mind. I have a rather lovely garden waiting for me. Although, as I’ve explained, it’s the discomfort that’s keeping me away at the moment. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll take a look at your joints to see if I can identify anything specific going on. Your blood pressure is 138/78. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, and now let’s check your joints. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in both of your knees, particularly on the inner side. There’s also some tenderness in your lower back, mostly on the left side. There doesn’t appear to be any swelling or redness in any of your joints. Your range of motion is a little limited in both knees and your lower back, but it doesn’t seem to be causing you significant pain at the moment. Does that feel accurate to you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, that’s about right. My back has been particularly bothersome lately. Especially when the weather is damp. And my knees, well, they always ache after I’ve been on my feet for too long. It's nothing unexpected, Doctor. I’ve been living with this discomfort for years. As for the rest… it’s all rather… predictable, wouldn’t you say? Honestly, I’m not sure this examination is telling you anything I haven’t already explained. Still, I suppose it’s your job.
DOCTOR: You're right, Ellan. It sounds like you've been very aware of your body and these aches for quite some time. The examination is mostly to rule out other possible causes, and to get a better understanding of the severity of the discomfort. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds most likely that you’re experiencing osteoarthritis, which is a common condition that causes joint pain and stiffness as you age. It's not an uncommon cause of discomfort in your knees and back, and it's often worse with activity and in damp weather. Now, before we discuss treatment options, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Osteo-what-you-call-it, you say? Well, I suppose that explains a few things. But honestly, Doctor, is this something I need to be terribly concerned about? I’ve lived a long and active life, and I’m not about to let a little… joint pain slow me down. Still, if you think I should be taking some sort of medication… what are my options? And are there any… side effects I should be aware of? I don’t want to trade one discomfort for another, you understand. I’m quite particular about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ellan. You’re right to ask about side effects. Osteoarthritis is not necessarily something you need to be terribly concerned about, but it's good to manage it so it doesn’t significantly impact your quality of life. There are a number of treatment options available. We can start with some simpler things, like over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen – although you’ve already mentioned ibuprofen doesn’t sit well with you, so we can certainly avoid that. There are also topical creams and gels that can help with the pain. For more significant pain, we can consider prescription medications, but those do come with potential side effects. For example, stronger pain relievers can sometimes cause drowsiness or constipation. There are also injections, like corticosteroids, that can be injected directly into the joint to reduce inflammation, but those are typically reserved for more severe cases. Before we jump to any medication, I would recommend trying some non-pharmacological options, like physical therapy and weight management, if applicable. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: Hmm. Physical therapy… I suppose that wouldn’t be the worst thing. As long as it doesn't involve too much strenuous exercise. And weight management… well, I’m quite slender, thank you very much. I don’t need any lectures about dieting. But as for medication… I’m still hesitant. I’ve always been rather wary of pills. Now, you mentioned something about… marijuana. That’s what I came here for, after all. Is that a viable option for someone with my condition? And what are the risks involved? My daughter keeps telling me it's perfectly safe, but I’m not convinced. She tends to exaggerate, you understand. She watches far too much television.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Ellan. You’re right to ask about the risks, and it's good you’re skeptical. Medical marijuana, or cannabis, is becoming increasingly used for a variety of conditions, including arthritis pain. There is some evidence to suggest it can help reduce pain and inflammation, improve sleep, and even reduce muscle stiffness. However, it’s not without risks and it’s not right for everyone. Some potential side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and impaired cognitive function. It can also interact with other medications you’re taking. And it’s important to note that the long-term effects of medical marijuana are still being studied. Given your history of elevated blood pressure and your concerns about medication side effects, it’s important to proceed with caution. We would need to carefully consider whether it’s the right option for you. I would also need to check the legality of medical marijuana in our state, and whether you meet the criteria for obtaining a prescription. And if we do decide to proceed, we would start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, carefully monitoring your response. Would you like me to provide you with more information about medical marijuana, and the potential risks and benefits?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to learn a bit more. But I want everything in plain English, understand? No medical jargon. I just want to know if it’s a safe and sensible option for someone my age, and whether it will interfere with my blood pressure medication. And… will it make me feel… sluggish? I need to be able to tend to my garden, you understand. That’s very important to me. My daughter keeps saying it will help me relax, but I don’t want to be… incapacitated. Just a little relief from the aches and pains, that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I will explain everything in plain English, and I understand your concerns completely. You're right to want to know if it will interfere with your medication or affect your ability to function. Medical marijuana contains chemicals called cannabinoids, the most well-known being THC and CBD. THC is the one that produces the psychoactive effects – the feeling of being "high." CBD doesn't produce those effects, and it’s thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. For arthritis pain, CBD is often preferred because it doesn't have the same psychoactive effects as THC. However, some people find that a combination of both THC and CBD is more effective. Now, regarding your blood pressure medication, cannabis can lower blood pressure. So it’s important to monitor your blood pressure closely if you decide to try it. We would start with a very low dose and gradually increase it as needed, carefully monitoring your response. As for making you feel sluggish, it can cause drowsiness, especially at higher doses. But starting with a low dose and finding the right balance can help minimize those side effects. We would work together to find a dose that provides you with relief from your pain without making you feel incapacitated. I have some informational pamphlets here about medical marijuana and its potential risks and benefits. I also have some resources online that I can share with you. Would you like me to go over these with you now, or would you prefer to take them home and review them at your leisure?
PATIENT: I suppose I’ll take them home and review them at my leisure. Honestly, Doctor, I need a bit of time to digest all of this. My daughter has been bombarding me with information for weeks, and it’s all rather… overwhelming. But thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience, and your willingness to answer my questions. I still have my doubts, mind you. But I suppose it’s worth considering. If I do decide to proceed, I’ll give you a call. And please, no medical jargon. Plain English, remember? I don’t want any surprises. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. Plain English, always. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. I'm happy to discuss this with you further, and to help you make the best decision for your health. Here's my direct line. . It was a pleasure meeting you today. Please take care, and enjoy your garden. . .
