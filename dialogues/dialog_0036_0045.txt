DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been getting… flushed. That's what my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, said it was. My face gets very red, and sometimes my chest too. It happens sometimes when I’m talking, or… just sitting. It's been going on for maybe a month now.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing – redness of the face and sometimes chest – for about a month now. And you’ve noticed it happens sometimes when you’re talking or even just resting. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the flushing a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe? It’s like… warm. Very warm. And red, of course. Not like a sunburn red, but… a bright red. And it feels… itchy sometimes, but not always. It comes and goes. It doesn’t hurt, just… uncomfortable. And it makes me feel shy, you know? Like everyone is looking at me. It lasts… maybe five minutes, maybe ten. Sometimes shorter. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm, bright red flushing that comes and goes, lasting anywhere from five to ten minutes. It’s itchy sometimes, and it’s making you feel self-conscious. I understand. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, besides talking or just sitting?
PATIENT: Trigger? Let me think… Sometimes when I eat spicy food. Not always, but often. And… oh! When I get excited. Like if someone tells a good story, or if I’m remembering something nice. It’s silly, I know. And… Mrs. Gable said maybe it’s the sun, but I try to stay in the shade. I don't think it’s the sun.
DOCTOR: No, that's not silly at all. Spicy food and getting excited are good things to note. So, it sounds like it can be brought on by certain foods and emotions. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms that happen with the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not like… pounding, just a little quicker. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not enough to fall, just… lightheaded. And… I sweat a little. Just on my face, when it’s red. That’s all, I think. It doesn’t happen every time, just sometimes with the flushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally with the flushing you experience a faster heartbeat, some lightheadedness, and some facial sweating. That’s helpful information. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… No, not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. My wife… she had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I’ve never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just a check-up now and then. I don’t take any medicine. Do you need to know about… things I used to do? Before my wife passed? I worked with people who had… problems. That was my job.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Just general medical history is fine. No major medical conditions, and no current medications. And you mentioned your wife had high blood pressure. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had any medical problems, like heart issues, high blood pressure, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had diabetes. And my brother, he had some problems with his heart, a long time ago. He smoked too much, I think. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in his life. And my wife's side… I don't know much about them. She didn't talk about her family much. It was… sad. I don’t think they got along. Does that help? I'm sorry, I don't remember much. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, a family history of diabetes and some heart issues on your side. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I live alone, since my wife passed. I mostly stay home. I read a lot. I like to garden, when the weather is nice. I walk a little, but not much. I eat… mostly simple food. Soup, vegetables, rice. I don't drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I used to be very active, but… not anymore. It's hard to explain. It's just… different now. I don’t have much energy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you live a quiet life, and you've understandably had some changes since your wife passed. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. My wife used to make spicy curry, and I never had a problem. I’ve never been stung by a bee, or anything like that. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I feel a little tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Yes, I think that gives me a good starting point. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My blood pressure is probably fine. I don’t eat much salt. But go ahead, please. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 145/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your lungs sound clear. I do hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart, but it's very faint. I'm also noting some mild redness on your face and chest. No rash or other skin changes. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The flushing, along with the rapid heartbeat and lightheadedness, could be related to a few different things. It could be something relatively benign, like rosacea, or it could be something more serious like a hormonal imbalance or even a heart condition. The murmur I heard needs to be investigated further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart condition? That doesn’t sound good. Rosacea… is that serious? I just thought I was getting warm. What does… “investigate” mean? Will I need… tests? I don’t like tests. I get nervous. And my wife… she always went to the doctor for everything. I don’t want to be like her. Is it something I did?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious when hearing about potential health issues. And you’re right to ask questions. First, let me reassure you that "investigate" simply means we need to gather more information to understand what's causing your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps on the face. It's usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable and it's best to get it properly diagnosed. As for your symptoms, the heart murmur I heard is something we need to check out further. It could be harmless, but it’s important to rule out any potential heart problems. To do that, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG will check your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test will help us look for any underlying issues. We might also consider an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, to get a better look at its structure and function. I understand you get nervous about tests, and we can take things at your pace. I'll be with you every step of the way, explaining everything and answering any questions you have. We can even start with just the EKG, and then see how you feel about proceeding with other tests. It’s important to gather more information to provide the best possible care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… that sounds… less scary than a blood test. I don't like needles. And an ultrasound… is that like what they use for babies? I don’t want to know if I look like a baby! Okay, let’s start with the EKG. If it’s okay, just the EKG. And… can I bring my glasses? I can’t see very well without them. And… how long will it take? I have a pot of soup on the stove. It shouldn’t boil over, but… my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she always worries about my cooking.
DOCTOR: Yes, an EKG is a very simple test. It doesn't involve needles, and it doesn’t take long at all – just a few minutes. We’ll attach some small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s completely painless. And yes, an echocardiogram uses similar technology to what’s used for pregnancy scans, but we’re not looking for a baby! It’s just a way to get a detailed picture of your heart. We can discuss that further if the EKG results warrant it. Absolutely, please bring your glasses! You'll need them to see clearly. And don’t worry about your soup! We’ll get you in and out quickly, and I’m sure Mrs. Gable understands. Let me get the order for the EKG. The technician will be with you shortly to perform the test. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we can discuss next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It’s just… I don’t like being a bother. My wife always… well, never mind. Just the EKG, please. And… is it okay if I sit down? My knees are bothering me a little. And maybe a glass of water? It’s very warm in here.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, sit down and get comfortable. And yes, absolutely, let me get you a glass of water. It is a little warm in here. You are not a bother at all, Mr. Withycombe. We are here to help you, and I want you to feel as comfortable as possible. Please, take your time and let me know if you need anything at all. The technician, Maria, will be with you in just a moment to perform the EKG. I'll be right nearby if you have any questions or concerns. Just relax, and we'll take things one step at a time.
