DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s about this…certification. Apparently, one must have one’s eyes and ears checked periodically. Quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I’ve been perfectly capable for decades, but bureaucracy, you understand. It's all about the paperwork, isn't it? I suppose you’ll be poking and prodding, then signing something?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, regulations are… as you say, sometimes necessary. It's less about your capabilities, Mr. Oriley, and more about ensuring everything is functioning optimally. A quick assessment is standard procedure. It won’t be overly invasive, I assure you. Before we begin, though, can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your vision or hearing lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness, that's a rather broad question, isn’t it? I’m sixty years old, Doctor. Things change. I suppose…everything feels a bit…dimmer, perhaps. And I occasionally have to ask people to repeat themselves, but that’s usually just them mumbling. It’s hardly a crisis. Honestly, I don’t spend my time meticulously cataloging the deterioration of my senses. Is that…sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s…helpful. “Dimmer” and needing repetition. Alright. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness or balance issues?
PATIENT: Ringing…now that you mention it…perhaps a little. It’s not constant, mind you. More like a…faint echo. And dizziness…well, I'm not a particularly agile man these days. I wouldn’t attribute a bit of unsteadiness to any medical condition. It’s simply…age. Really, Doctor, are we going to dissect my entire life story here? I just need the paper, don't I?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a “bit of unsteadiness” can be relevant. Just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s proceed with a basic examination then. I’d like to check your visual acuity first. Could you please follow my instructions and read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Very well. Charts. Honestly, it’s like being back in school. I suppose I haven’t much choice. Let’s get this over with. It's...E, F, P...is that a T? This is rather small, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is somewhat reduced. Okay, let's try the other eye. Please read this line as well. Don't strain yourself if it's difficult. Just tell me what you can see.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my eyes aren't getting worse with each line, are they? …P…R…L… is that a D? Everything is blurring together. This is a rather…unpleasant experience. I maintain this is all unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. It appears we do have some visual impairment. Not severe, but noticeable. Now, let's move on to your hearing. I'm going to place headphones on you and play some tones at different frequencies. Please indicate when you hear a sound, even if it’s faint. I'll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Headphones, now? What next, a full body scan? Fine. Proceed. But I assure you, my hearing is perfectly adequate for everyday conversation. People just don't enunciate properly these days. And please, try not to blast anything directly into my ears. One has sensitivities, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll start at a low volume. Just listen carefully, and raise your hand when you hear a tone. Any tone, no matter how faint. Let me know when you hear something.
PATIENT: …Nothing. No, wait… perhaps… a very faint… buzzing? No, it’s probably just the equipment. …Still nothing. Honestly, this is a waste of my time and yours, Doctor. Is there not a quicker way to obtain this…certification? It feels like an elaborate…test of patience.
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems we're detecting some hearing loss in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies. Not unexpected given your age, but it's something we need to document. Mr. Oriley, while this certification may seem like a formality, these preliminary findings suggest a mild degree of both visual and auditory impairment. We can discuss options for managing these issues, such as glasses or a hearing aid if you're interested. It’s important to address these things to maintain your quality of life and safety. Would you be open to a referral to an ophthalmologist and audiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation?
PATIENT: Glasses, you say? A hearing aid? Good heavens, no. I have no intention of becoming reliant on contraptions. I’ve managed perfectly well for sixty years without them. And "contraptions," I might add, are expensive. I simply require the paper, Doctor. A signature, a stamp… whatever is necessary to fulfill this bureaucratic requirement. I do not have time for lengthy evaluations and…assistance. It seems we're speaking at cross-purposes. I believe I've answered your questions. Is the certification attainable, or must I endure further…interrogation? .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. I understand your reluctance. However, I must advise that signing off on this certification without fully addressing these findings would be…unprofessional. To proceed responsibly, I'm prepared to complete the form with the caveat that it notes these preliminary indicators of vision and hearing loss. This will likely necessitate follow-up appointments with the specialists as required by the certification board. Is that acceptable?
