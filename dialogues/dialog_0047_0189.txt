DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But my daughter insisted. Said something about… well, it was in the toilet. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fuss. Old man’s troubles, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. And your daughter is the one who brought you in. I understand. It’s good she encouraged you to come. "Old man’s troubles" can be a lot of things, Mr. Rowbottom, and it’s best to get it checked. Now, can you tell me a little more about this blood?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't gushing, if that’s what you’re thinking. More like… streaks. Red streaks. And it happened… let me think… twice now. A couple of times in the last week. Nothing before that that I noticed. I eat alright, mostly. Steak, potatoes, you know. Proper food. Not like this newfangled stuff they’re peddling these days.
DOCTOR: Streaks of red blood, twice in the last week. And no prior episodes that you’re aware of. Alright. And is it mixed with the stool, or is it coating it?
PATIENT: Coating it, I’d say. Definitely coating. Not in it, all mixed up. On the outside. Like… like someone brushed a little paint on it. Not a pleasant image, I know, but that’s the best way to describe it. Honestly, I've seen better colors coming out of an engine. And those were a problem.
DOCTOR: Coating the stool… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? I go when I need to go. Always have. Maybe a bit… slower these days, now that you mention it. Takes a bit longer to… well, you know. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart. Everything slows down eventually. Used to be able to clear a runway faster than some of these young fellas. But no, nothing drastic. Just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Slower bowel movements. Now, have you been experiencing any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort along with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A bit of a rumble sometimes, you know, like an engine misfiring. But nothing I’d call pain. Just… old man’s grumbles. I've had worse pulling g-forces in a Hurricane. And I’ve definitely felt worse after a bad plate of fish. No, no real pain. Though my back's been a bit stiff lately, but that’s from lugging around this frame for eighty-eight years.
DOCTOR: No significant pain, just some abdominal rumbling and back stiffness. And you said you haven't noticed this blood before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve… well, I’ve seen things come and go, believe me. Spent a lot of time looking at gauges and fluids, and I know when something’s not right. This is new. And honestly, I don’t like it. Makes me uneasy. Used to being in control, you know? Seeing this… it feels… off. Like a warning light I can’t ignore. Though, truthfully, I probably should have just ignored it. Doctors always make a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Rowbottom, ignoring warning lights isn’t generally a good practice, whether it’s in an aircraft or your body. I’m going to need to ask a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… my daughter keeps saying my trousers are a bit loose. But I’ve been eating plenty! Steak, like I said. Maybe she’s just trying to get me to buy new clothes. Women and their shopping… No, I haven't tried to lose weight. Never had to. I’ve always been a solid build. Used to be able to wrestle a bear, if I had to. Not now, of course. But no, no intentional weight loss. Just… maybe a bit looser around the middle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Unintentional weight loss, potentially. Now, have you been feeling unusually tired or weak lately?
PATIENT: Tired? Well, yes. But who isn't at eighty-eight? A man gets tired. Been around the block a few times, you know. Long days, long nights… flying all sorts of routes. Flying takes it out of you. And the garden keeps me busy. Weeding, mowing… it's a good workout. So yes, I'm tired. But that's just… being an old man. Not some sudden weakness, if that's what you're asking. Just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me see… Had my appendix out when I was a lad. Nothing serious. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a bit high a few years back, but I stopped going. Didn't like all the poking and prodding. And my knees ache something fierce when it rains, but that's just the weather. Never been much for doctors, honestly. A bit of liniment and a strong drink usually does the trick. I've had worse injuries patching up engines in the middle of the Pacific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy, history of elevated blood pressure. And you haven't been following up with a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: No. Waste of time, if you ask me. They just want to sell you pills and tell you to avoid everything you enjoy. Steak, gardening, a good strong drink… all bad for you, apparently. I've lived a long life, and I haven't needed them until now. Honestly, I suspect my daughter just felt like she needed to justify her shopping habit by getting me to come in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he lived to be seventy. Heart trouble, I think. My mother, she died young, some sort of illness. Nothing specific that I recall. And my brother… he was a reckless sort, gone too soon in a car accident. Not much for family history, really. We weren't a close-knit bunch. Everyone kept to themselves. Spent more time with my crew than my kin, to be honest. More reliable company.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Liniment for the knees, that's it. And maybe a bit of brandy for the aches now and then, but that doesn't count. I don't believe in all those pills. They just mask the problem. A man needs to tough it out, face things head-on. Been doing that for eighty-eight years, and I'm not about to start now. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming in here. Feels like a waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things in my travels, believe me. Strange fruits, exotic spices… never bothered me. Tough as nails, that’s what I am. Used to be able to eat dirt and not flinch. This generation is too soft, if you ask me. Always complaining about something. No, no allergies. Just… old man troubles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. It’s important for me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? At my age? Honestly. Feels a bit… undignified. But alright, alright. If you insist. Though I'm warning you, I'm not as flexible as I used to be. It might be a struggle. And don't go poking around too much. I've had enough poking and prodding for one afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as you can. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds… a bit muffled, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear, but some diminished breath sounds. Alright. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. A bit tender there, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Like a bruise, but deeper. I probably just slept on it wrong. Happens sometimes. And don’t go digging around too much. I'm telling you, I've had enough poking for one day. This isn't going to be pretty.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: A little uncomfortable there too, but not as bad. Feels… tight. Like a knot. Probably just old age. Everything’s tightening up, you know? Like an old engine that hasn’t been properly maintained. Everything’s creaking and groaning. I’m telling you, I’ve had better days. This is all just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished. Also diminished. Alright. Now, I’m going to need a stool sample. The lab will need to analyze it to determine the cause of the bleeding. The nurse will give you a container and instructions. And given your age, some of the findings on this exam and the reports of the blood in the stool, I'm going to recommend a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Now hold on just a minute. You want to… look at my insides? With a camera? Absolutely not. That’s… that's preposterous. I’m eighty-eight years old. I've lived a good life. I don’t need to be poked and prodded and… looked at. It's undignified, it's unnecessary, and frankly, it sounds terrifying. And a stool sample? Really? This is getting ridiculous. I came in here because my daughter made me, and now you’re telling me I need to… give you my stool? No. Absolutely not. I'm leaving. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance, but this isn't about poking and prodding for the sake of it. The bleeding in your stool is a serious symptom. It could be something minor, but it could also be something more concerning, like a polyp or even cancer. A colonoscopy is the best way to determine the cause and ensure we can address it promptly. And a stool sample is a simple test that can provide valuable information. I am recommending this test because I have a duty to ensure you receive the best possible care, and that includes ruling out any potential serious conditions. I understand it’s not pleasant, but it’s necessary. I can explain the procedure in more detail, address any concerns you have, and answer any questions you may have. But ignoring this symptom is not an option. I'm recommending this test because I am concerned, and I want to ensure your health and wellbeing. Would you be willing to at least consider it?
PATIENT: Concerned, are you? Well, I've faced worse than a bit of blood in the stool. I’ve stared down engine fires, navigated storms over the Pacific, and wrestled with bureaucracy for decades. A little bleeding isn’t going to frighten me. Alright, alright. Explain it to me. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And I still don't like the idea of giving you my stool. It's… undignified. What exactly does this colonoscopy involve? And what are we even looking for? Tell me in plain English, no fancy medical jargon. And if it sounds too invasive, I’m walking out. I mean it. This old man has had enough for one day.
DOCTOR: Alright. In plain English. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum. We gently guide it through your colon – that’s your large intestine – to look for any abnormalities, like polyps. Polyps are small growths that can sometimes become cancerous. It’s not a pleasant experience, I won’t lie to you. You’ll need to empty your colon completely beforehand – that’s why the stool sample is important. The procedure is typically done under sedation, so you’ll be comfortable and won’t feel any pain. During the procedure, we can also remove any polyps we find. And after the procedure, we’ll send a sample to the lab to analyze it. It's the most accurate way to diagnose any problems in your colon and ensure we can address them quickly. I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom, and I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. It’s a necessary step to protect your health, and it will give us the information we need to ensure you can continue living a long and healthy life. We'll discuss the risks and benefits in detail. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Sedation, you say? That sounds… less awful. But emptying my colon completely? What does that even mean? And what if you find something… bad? I'm not sure I want to know. And this… removing polyps. Does that hurt? Is it going to leave a mess? I'm a practical man, Doctor. I need to know what I'm getting myself into. And frankly, I'm still not thrilled about the whole stool sample business. It's… personal. Is there no other way? Some other test, some other scan, something less… invasive?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, let’s address your concerns one by one. Regarding emptying your colon, it involves a special diet and a laxative that will clear everything out. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s essential for a clear view during the procedure. The nurse will provide detailed instructions and support you through the process. As for finding something, it's true there's a possibility. But finding something early is always better than finding it late. We'll discuss all the options and develop a plan based on what we find. Regarding pain during the polyp removal, it’s typically minimal. We use specialized instruments, and the sedation will help you stay comfortable. There might be some minor cramping afterward, but it’s usually manageable. Now, regarding alternative tests… there are stool-based tests that can detect blood or certain markers associated with cancer. However, they are less accurate than a colonoscopy and can sometimes give false positives or negatives. They also don't allow us to remove any polyps we find. If a stool-based test comes back positive, you would still need a colonoscopy. I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. But I strongly believe a colonoscopy is the best option for your health. It allows us to get a clear view of your colon, remove any potential problems, and give you peace of mind. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits in more detail?
PATIENT: Peace of mind, you say? That’s… tempting. I haven't had much of that lately. But this whole thing… emptying my colon, being poked and prodded, the camera… it just feels… violating. Alright, alright. Explain the risks. Lay them all out for me. And what exactly are the benefits? What are we even looking for besides these polyps? And what if you find something… serious? What then? What are my options? I need to know everything before I agree to anything. This isn't some simple engine repair, Doctor. This is… personal. And frankly, I'm still not thrilled about the stool sample. Lay it all out for me, Doctor. And don't sugarcoat it. I'm an old man, I've faced worse. I want to know exactly what I'm getting myself into.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to discuss this openly. Let’s start with the risks. The most common risks associated with a colonoscopy are minor. These include bloating, cramping, and mild bleeding. These usually resolve on their own within a few days. More serious risks are rare, but they can include perforation of the colon – that’s a tear in the colon wall – or bleeding that requires a transfusion. These complications are very uncommon, but they can happen. We take every precaution to minimize these risks, and we have procedures in place to address them if they occur. Now, let's talk about the benefits. A colonoscopy allows us to detect polyps – those small growths I mentioned earlier – and remove them before they have a chance to become cancerous. It can also detect early signs of cancer, which can significantly improve your chances of successful treatment. We also look for other abnormalities, like diverticulosis – that's small pouches that can form in the colon wall – or inflammation. Early detection is key in managing these conditions. Now, what if we find something serious?
PATIENT: Go on. What then? Don't spare me the details. I need to know what I'm facing. And what are my options, if you do find something… bad? Surgery? Radiation? Chemotherapy? Lay it all out for me, Doctor. And be honest. I'm an old man, I've faced worse, but I need to know what I'm getting into. And frankly, I'm still not thrilled about this stool sample. It feels… undignified. But I'm listening. Tell me everything. Don't sugarcoat it. I need to make an informed decision.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. If we find something serious – let's say, a cancerous tumor – your options will depend on several factors, including the size and location of the tumor, your overall health, and your preferences. The most common treatment for colon cancer is surgery. This involves removing the tumor and a portion of the colon. In some cases, this can be done laparoscopically – that’s using small incisions and a camera – which can lead to a faster recovery. After surgery, you may need chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy involves using drugs to kill cancer cells, while radiation therapy uses high-energy rays. The type of chemotherapy or radiation therapy you need will depend on the type of cancer you have and your overall health. In some cases, immunotherapy may also be an option. Immunotherapy involves using your own immune system to fight cancer. Early detection is key to successful treatment. The earlier we find cancer, the easier it is to treat. And the more treatment options you have. I understand this is a lot to take in. And I want to assure you that I will be with you every step of the way. We'll discuss all your options in detail, and we'll develop a plan that's right for you. Now, regarding the stool sample… I understand your concerns. It is a personal matter. But it’s a simple test that can provide valuable information. It can help us detect blood or other markers associated with cancer. And it can help us determine if you need a colonoscopy. Would you be willing to consider the stool sample, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: A lot to take in, you say? That’s an understatement. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation… it sounds… grim. And me, at my age? I’ve lived a good life, Doctor. I’ve seen things, done things… I don’t know if I have the strength for all that. Alright. I’ll consider the stool sample. But I’m not promising anything. It still feels… undignified. And if it comes back positive, I may just refuse the colonoscopy. I’ve lived a good life, Doctor. I may just decide to enjoy what time I have left, instead of subjecting myself to all that poking and prodding and… grimness. But alright. I’ll consider it. Give me the container. And tell me… how long does it take to get the results? And what exactly will they be looking for? And if it is bad… can I at least choose where I spend my remaining time? I’ve always wanted to see the Pacific coast…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. It’s your body, and you have the right to make your own choices. I’m glad you’re willing to consider the stool sample. The nurse will give you a container and instructions on how to collect it. It’s a simple process, and it doesn’t take long. The lab typically takes about a week to get the results back. They will be looking for blood or other markers associated with cancer. If they find anything abnormal, we’ll discuss your options in detail. And regarding your wish to see the Pacific coast… absolutely. That’s a wonderful idea. And if, unfortunately, the news is not good, we will do everything we can to ensure you can spend your remaining time doing what makes you happy. We have resources available to help with palliative care, and we can discuss your options in detail. I want to assure you that you’re not alone in this. I will be with you every step of the way, and we will do everything we can to ensure you have the best possible quality of life, no matter what. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s enough for now. I’ve got a lot to think about. And a stool sample to… collect. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for… not sugarcoating things. It’s… appreciated. I’ll see the nurse, then. And… I’ll think about the Pacific coast. But don't expect any miracles. I've lived a good life, Doctor. A long life. And I may just decide to enjoy what time I have left, regardless of what that sample says. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Take your time. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best. And remember, I'm here for you, no matter what. The nurse will be right with you.
