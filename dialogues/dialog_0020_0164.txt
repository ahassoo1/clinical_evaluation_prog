DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been feeling really unwell after I ate some fava beans. I got really yellow, and just…not right. It’s been happening a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out. It’s the jaundice that worried me, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing of the skin – jaundice – and feeling unwell after eating fava beans… That is definitely something we want to investigate. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, how long has this been happening for?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… the first time was maybe… six months ago? I didn’t think much of it then, just thought it was something I ate. But it happened again about a month ago, and then again just last week. Each time it’s after I’ve had fava beans. I hadn't eaten them in years before that, so it's a bit odd. It lasts for a few days each time, then goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recurring episodes linked to fava bean ingestion… A few days each time. And you hadn't had them for years before this started. Do you notice any other symptoms during those episodes, besides the yellowing of your skin?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When I get the yellowing, I feel really, really tired. More tired than usual, and sort of weak. And sometimes my stomach feels a bit upset, you know, like a bit of cramping and… not wanting to eat much. And I’ve noticed my urine is… darker than normal. Almost tea-colored. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue, weakness, stomach upset, and darker urine… those are all important things to know. We're starting to build a clearer picture. Do you have any trouble breathing at all during these episodes?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no trouble breathing. It's mostly just the tiredness and the feeling unwell. And the yellowing, of course, which is a bit scary. I haven't felt short of breath or anything like that. I just feel… drained. Like my batteries are completely flat. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a little worried now, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mande. It’s good you're taking this seriously. Based on what you're describing – the jaundice triggered by fava beans, the fatigue, the dark urine – it could be something called Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, or G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition where your body doesn’t have enough of an enzyme to protect your red blood cells, and certain things, like fava beans, can cause them to break down. But we need to confirm that with a blood test. Have you ever been told you have any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I haven’t had any major illnesses or anything. My doctor back home, in Romania, used to just give me a yearly checkup and say I was fine. I moved here about five years ago, and I haven’t really had a chance to find a regular doctor, until now, I guess. So, no, I’ve never been told I have anything before. What would this blood test involve? And what happens if it is this G6PD deficiency? Is there a treatment?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A yearly checkup with no concerns is helpful information. The blood test is pretty standard – just a small sample taken from your arm. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. This pamphlet explains G6PD deficiency in a bit more detail. Basically, if you do have it, it means you need to avoid certain things that can trigger the breakdown of your red blood cells – fava beans being one of them. There’s no cure, but it’s manageable with avoidance. In severe cases, you might need a blood transfusion, but that’s rare. Before we proceed with the blood test, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Thank you for the pamphlet, Doctor. I’ll have a read through that later. It’s good to know it’s manageable. I don't take any medication at all, nothing. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been very careful with what I eat, especially after moving here, because you hear so many stories. I think that’s it, as far as my health goes. Should we go ahead with the blood test then? I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No medications or allergies, that simplifies things. And yes, let's go ahead with the blood test. It will help us get a definitive answer. I'll just need to quickly check your height and weight, and then we can head to the lab. It’s just down the hall. Do you mind stepping on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m probably a little lighter than usual, to be honest, with feeling so unwell lately. Here we go…
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 178 centimeters, and your weight is 132 pounds. That’s…within a normal range. Alright, Mande, let's head to the lab. I’ll have the order ready for them, and they'll take care of you. We'll get the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid fava beans, just to be safe. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions before we go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time. Avoiding fava beans… that shouldn’t be too difficult. I rarely eat them anyway, it’s just been a craving recently. Let’s head to the lab then. And thank you again, Dr. Beinborn. I feel a little better just knowing we’re figuring this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. That’s what I’m here for. It's always best to get things checked out, and hopefully, this will give us a clear answer. The lab technician will be expecting you. Just let them know you're here for G6PD deficiency testing. I’ll be in my office, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all.
PATIENT: .
