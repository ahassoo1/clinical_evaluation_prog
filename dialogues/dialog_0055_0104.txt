DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time. My throat… it hurts. It's been hurting for a few days now. Just… a pain. Is that enough? I separate and filter things all day, you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: A sore throat, yes. “A pain,” as you say. We’ll certainly look into that. Just to clarify, when did this pain begin?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep track of dates. A few days, like I said. Maybe longer. It doesn’t… interfere with my work, not really. It’s just… annoying. Is that all you need to know? I really must get back to the machine. It’s very precise work.
DOCTOR: While the precise onset is helpful, we can proceed without it. You mentioned it doesn’t interfere with your work. Are you experiencing any other symptoms with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean, symptoms? It hurts when I swallow, if that’s what you're asking. And… I feel a little tired, maybe. But everyone is tired, aren’t they? Especially doing important work like… well, like what I do. Is it serious, Doctor? Because I truly don’t have time for a lot of… fuss.
DOCTOR: Pain upon swallowing is relevant, yes. And fatigue can certainly be a symptom. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Certainly not. I don't get those things. A cough? No, I separate the dust, remember? I'm very careful. A runny nose… well, sometimes. But everyone gets a little sniffle, don’t they? Look, Doctor, are you going to give me something or not? I have machines waiting. Very important machines.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you are concerned about your time. However, a proper assessment is necessary before I can determine the appropriate course of action. Allow me to perform a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your lungs and examine your throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine my throat? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I don't… I don't like people looking in my throat. It’s… it’s a personal thing. And my lungs are fine. Perfectly fine. I separate dust, remember? You’re a doctor, shouldn’t you just… give me something? An antibiotic, perhaps? I’ve heard those work. I really must insist. This is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, prescribing medication without a proper examination is not sound medical practice, and frankly, is irresponsible. I understand your reluctance, but I cannot simply give you an antibiotic based on your description. It's important to determine the cause of your symptoms before initiating any treatment. Given your unwillingness to allow a basic examination, and with no clear indication of a bacterial infection, I recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever and increased fluids. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, chills, or difficulty breathing, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
