DOCTOR: Right, Raymonde Kelder. 76 years old. Okay. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Yes, that's right. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. I just… don't feel right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t even get very hungry before I feel full. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s… troubling me. I can't really eat much anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Don’t feel right” and getting sick to your stomach… and feeling full quickly. “A bit now” is vague, though. Can you be a little more specific about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specifics. That's… hard. Let me think. It feels like… maybe since spring? Or was it summer? Honestly, the days all sort of blend together these days. It definitely wasn't as bad in the winter, I remember that. I wasn’t having trouble eating at all then. But since the weather got warmer… it’s just been getting worse, slowly. I wish I could give you a better answer. My mind doesn’t work like it used to, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, spring… so roughly three or four months. And progressively worsening. Right. And when you say "sick to your stomach," is that nausea – feeling like you're going to vomit – or are you actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not… not vomiting, thankfully. Just the feeling, you know? Like… a queasy feeling. Like when you're on a boat and it's rocking, but I haven’t been on a boat in years! It just comes and goes, but it's pretty constant these days. It makes it hard to do much of anything, really. And then, like I said, just a few bites of food and I’m stuffed. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea without vomiting, and early satiety – feeling full quickly. Any particular foods trigger it, or does it seem to happen regardless of what you eat?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I don’t know if it’s particular foods. I used to love a good roast chicken, but even that doesn’t sound good anymore. And it doesn't matter if it’s something light like soup, or… well, anything. It just seems to happen no matter what I try to eat. I've been trying to stick to smaller portions, which helps a little, but not much. It's just… frustrating. I used to enjoy my meals so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I've been… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I am 76, so… is that anything? And I think I've lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been keeping track. My daughter, Sarah, she mentioned it last time she visited, said I looked a bit thinner. But again… could just be my imagination. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and unintentional weight loss noted. And your daughter mentioned the weight loss. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago, that was a long time back. And I have arthritis, naturally. It flares up from time to time. And… I had some tests done a few years back, something about… cancer. I don't recall the specifics. It was at the hospital, and they did a lot of poking and prodding. They said it was… contained, I think. But honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. Sarah handles most of that now.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a history of gallbladder removal. And a past history of… cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Cancer. It was… in my abdomen, I believe. They did surgery, and then… treatments. Chemotherapy, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember much about it. It was all very frightening, and I was so weak. They said it was… under control. They said I was in remission. But… well, I’m not sure if that means anything anymore, given how I’ve been feeling. Is it possible… could it have come back? I hadn’t even thought about it until you asked. It’s just… everything feels so different this time.
DOCTOR: Right. A history of abdominal cancer in remission. Okay. We’ll need to review those records, of course. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I take something for my arthritis, this little white pill. And another one for my blood pressure, a pink one. And… Oh, and something for my stomach, but I don’t really take it much anymore. It doesn’t seem to help with the nausea. Sarah makes sure I have everything I need, but I forget what they all do, honestly. I just take them when she tells me to. It's all in there, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… naproxen for arthritis, lisinopril for blood pressure, and… ranitidine. An H2 blocker. Yes, that wouldn’t be very effective for persistent nausea. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any trouble with medications before, not that I can recall. And I eat pretty much anything. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, so I’ve eaten all sorts of vegetables. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But you know… my memory isn't what it used to be, so I can’t be certain. Perhaps Sarah would know better. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen… and check your weight and blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand. My abdomen, you say? That’s where… where they found the trouble before. It doesn't bother me, not really. I'm just a bit worried, that’s all. Go right ahead. I trust you to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished, which is common with age. Lungs are clear. Now, abdomen… There’s some tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the right side. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Not acutely inflamed, but definitely sensitive to the touch. And your weight is 56 kilograms, which represents some weight loss. Blood pressure is 140/90. Okay. I'm going to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CA-125. The CA-125 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in certain cancers. We'll also need to get a copy of your previous cancer records from the hospital. That'll give us a better understanding of what happened before, and help us determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh my… that sounds like a lot of tests. A tumor marker… is that… is that bad? And my records… I don’t know if Sarah has all of those. Is it very important? I just… I don't want to go through all of that again. I'm already so tired. What do you think is going on, Doctor? Are you worried?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Raymonde. And yes, it is a lot of tests. The CA-125, elevated levels can indicate the presence of cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons – benign conditions, even just inflammation. That’s why we need to run the tests, to get a clear picture. As for your records, it's very important. Knowing the type of cancer you had, the stage, the treatments you received… it all informs our decisions. It’s not ideal, I know, but it’s essential. Based on your symptoms – the nausea, the early satiety, the weight loss, and the tenderness in your abdomen – there are several possibilities. It could be related to your previous cancer, or it could be something else entirely – a gastrointestinal issue, a side effect of your medications… We simply don’t have enough information yet to say for certain. That’s what these tests are for. We need to rule things out. I’m not going to speculate until we have the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes sense. Rule things out. I understand. Sarah… she’ll help me get the records. She’s very good at all that. You’re very kind, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s just… frightening, you know? To think it might be coming back. When will I get the results? How long will I have to wait?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to be frightened, Raymonde. We'll get through this, one step at a time. The lab results should be back in about five to seven business days. It might take a little longer to get the records from the hospital, depending on how quickly they can process the request. Sarah will be able to help track everything down. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And try to maintain a small, bland diet – soups, crackers, toast – until we have a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all, Doctor. You’ve answered everything. Thank you… thank you very much. I’ll… I'll let Sarah know. And I'll try not to worry too much. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. And remember, try to stay calm. We'll figure this out. Have a good day, Raymonde.
PATIENT: .
