DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band sometimes. It’s been going on for…oh, let me think…about a week now, maybe a little longer. Not terrible, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. A headache for about a week, located in the back of your head, feeling like a tight band. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t come and go real fast, y’know? It’s more…steady. Like a dull ache most of the time. Sometimes it gets sharper if I’m really concentrating on something, or if I get a little flustered. Noticed it a bit more when I’m out in the sun too, but I spend most of my days inside with clients, so it’s not a constant thing. I don't think it's a migraine, never had one of those, thankfully. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. A steady, dull ache, sharper with concentration or stress, and potentially worsened by sun exposure. And you haven’t experienced migraines before, good to know. Now, to get a better understanding, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced?
PATIENT: Hmm, a scale, huh? Well, when it’s just a normal day, I’d say…maybe a 3 or 4. Not enough to stop me from workin', but enough to notice. When I'm really thinkin' hard, or get a bit upset with a client…then it creeps up to maybe a 6, 7 on a bad day. Never higher than that, thankfully. It’s not like a stabbing pain or anything, just a…pressure. Is that helpful? I'm not real good with numbers sometimes, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Percell, thank you. A baseline of 3 or 4, increasing to 6 or 7 with stress, and described as pressure rather than a sharp pain. That gives me a good starting point. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think…not really. No blurry vision, no dizziness. My stomach’s been okay, haven’t felt nauseous or anything. I haven’t been all that tired, though I am gettin’ on in years, so a little fatigue is normal, I guess. Oh! Now that you mention it, my neck has been a little stiff sometimes. Not all the time, but when I wake up in the mornin', it’s a bit achy. Could that be related? I mostly just rub it out with some liniment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurry vision, dizziness, or nausea. Some normal fatigue for your age, and neck stiffness, particularly upon waking. That's good information, Percell. Neck stiffness could certainly be related to the headaches. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, must've been…oh, thirty years ago now? Other than that, not much. High blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor put me on some pills for that, and it's been under control ever since. I try to eat healthy, mostly. No diabetes, no heart trouble that I know of. I used to be pretty active, but slowin' down a bit now. Mostly just desk work these days, helpin' folks with their finances. Is there anything specific you're lookin' for? I sometimes forget what doctors need to know, heh.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Percell. You're doing great. Gallbladder removal thirty years ago and controlled high blood pressure – that’s helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see…I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Been takin' it for…oh, must be ten years now, maybe more. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s only when I really need it, not every day. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, if you know what I mean. I prefer a good rub down from my daughter when my joints ache, heh.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily for high blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. I understand your preference for avoiding medication when possible. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife used to be allergic to bee stings, but she’s…well, she passed away a few years back. But I don’t have any allergies myself. I can eat pretty much anything. Though I don’t care much for spicy food, heh. But that’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Percell. That must have been a difficult time. And thank you for letting me know about the allergies – or rather, the lack of them. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, she had a pretty good life. She had some arthritis, like me, but nothing too serious. My father died when he was in his sixties, heart trouble, I think. And my sister…she had high blood pressure too, just like me. But other than that, not much. No cancer in the family, no major illnesses that I know of. We weren’t a real close family, to be honest, so I don't know much about their health history. Mostly just what I remember from childhood. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Percell. A family history of arthritis and high blood pressure is good to know. And it's perfectly alright that you don't have a lot of detailed information – you've given me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve been to doctors enough times to know the drill, heh. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay? Though I doubt it will. I'm a pretty easy patient, mostly. Just try not to poke too hard, my bones ain't what they used to be!
DOCTOR: I assure you, I’ll be as gentle as possible, Percell. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. Be careful now, it's a little thin, heh. Workin' with numbers all day doesn't build much muscle, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your neck. Could you gently turn your head to the left…and to the right?
PATIENT: There we go. Feels a little stiff, as I mentioned, but nothing too bad. Just a little achy in the mornings. Oh, and here... It feels a little tender right here, where the muscles meet the spine. But it's probably just from sleepin' wrong, heh.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some tenderness in those muscles, and some mild tightness. There doesn't appear to be any swelling or obvious abnormalities. Now, let me just check your range of motion. Could you please look up towards the ceiling…and now look down towards your chest?
PATIENT: There we go. Feels a little restricted, as I said, but nothing too painful. Just a little stiff. I used to be able to turn my head all the way around, but that was a long time ago, heh. I guess I'm just gettin' old.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to experience some stiffness with age, Percell. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not significantly so. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you are experiencing tension headaches, likely related to stress and muscle tightness in your neck. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to keep an eye on. It could be contributing to the headaches, or it could be a separate issue.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, huh? That sounds about right. I do worry about things a lot, I guess. And I’ve been busier than usual lately with clients. So stress makes sense. As for the blood pressure…well, I’ve been forgettin’ to take my pills sometimes, to be honest. I get distracted easily, heh. What do you recommend, Doctor? Should I take something for the headaches? Or try to relax more? Or maybe both?
DOCTOR: It sounds like a multi-faceted approach would be best, Percell. First, let’s address the blood pressure. It’s very important to take your Lisinopril as prescribed. I recommend setting a reminder on your phone, or linking it to a daily routine to help you remember. We can also discuss strategies to help manage your stress levels. Things like deep breathing exercises, gentle stretching, or even pursuing hobbies you enjoy can make a big difference. As for the headaches, we can start with some conservative measures. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can provide temporary relief. I also recommend applying a warm compress or taking a warm shower to help relax your neck muscles. If those measures don’t provide enough relief, we can consider other options. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant?
PATIENT: Hmm, a muscle relaxant… I’m not real keen on taking more pills if I can avoid it, Doctor. I've always been a bit sensitive to medications, and they make me feel drowsy. Maybe let's try the ibuprofen and the warm compress first? And I will try to remember my blood pressure pills better, I promise. I could ask my daughter to help me set up a reminder on my phone, she's good with those things. She worries about me too, bless her heart. What do you think? Is that a reasonable plan?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Percell. Starting with the ibuprofen and warm compress is a good first step. And having your daughter’s help with reminders is excellent. It’s good to have a support system. I'm going to write you a prescription for ibuprofen, just in case. I'll also give you a handout with some information on stress management techniques and exercises you can try at home. I would like to recheck your blood pressure in a week or two to see how things are progressing. If your headaches worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please contact me immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me, and for not just tellin' me to take a bunch of pills. I appreciate that a lot. And yes, a week or two sounds good for a check-up. I’ll try my best to remember everything you told me. And I'll definitely let you know if anything changes. You've been a big help, Doctor Abady. Truly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I should probably get goin'. My daughter is probably wonderin' where I am.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Here are your prescription and the information sheet. Take care, and have a good day. And give your daughter my best!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too, and thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Percell. Take care of yourself. .
