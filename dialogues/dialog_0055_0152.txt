DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. EADDY. It says here you’re 54 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 54. It’s good to meet you. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. That’s why I’m here, to talk about that. I don’t really know what it means, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A letter from the lab… concerning your cholesterol levels. Understandable that you’d want to discuss that. It’s… quite common, these days. Now, when you say "a little high," do you happen to recall any specific numbers from the letter?
PATIENT: Hmm… numbers… let me think. There was a big number… 240, maybe? And then some smaller ones… 150 and something… and 40? I think. It was a lot of numbers, honestly. I mostly just saw that they said it wasn’t good. I don't really understand all that stuff.
DOCTOR: 240… 150… and 40, you say. Yes, those numbers are a bit elevated, though it’s hardly cause for immediate alarm. Let's clarify a few things. Cholesterol isn’t a single entity, you see. There's HDL – that's the “good” cholesterol – LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, and triglycerides. Those numbers you mentioned likely correspond to your total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, respectively. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, okay… good and bad cholesterol. That makes a little more sense. My father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. He needed a… a stent, I think it was called. And my mother, she also had high blood pressure, if that matters. So, yes, some family history, I guess. I don’t know about cholesterol specifically, though. They didn’t talk about that much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: A stent, and your mother with hypertension… that is relevant. Family history certainly plays a role. Now, Ms. Geho, before we discuss potential interventions, let’s get a more comprehensive picture. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… not really. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, some fish a couple times a week. I do like my cheese, I have to admit, and maybe a little too much chocolate. But nothing major has changed, no. I haven't been eating a lot of fast food or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Cheese and chocolate… a common indulgence. Very well. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… I walk, most days. Not a long walk, maybe half an hour. And I do some gardening, which I figure counts for something. It’s not strenuous, but I’m out moving around. I used to go to a yoga class, but I haven't been in a while. Life just… got busy, you know? It's not like I sit all day, though. I'm pretty active around the house.
DOCTOR: Half an hour of walking, gardening… adequate, but perhaps not sufficient given your family history. Now, Ms. Geho, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It’s standard procedure. Then we can discuss some options. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm not afraid of a little check-up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is… 142 over 90. Slightly elevated. As I suspected. Your blood pressure is a little high, along with the cholesterol results. We need to address both. Now, before we delve into potential medications, let’s discuss lifestyle modifications. Increasing your physical activity to at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week would be beneficial. We also need to refine your diet. Less cheese, less chocolate, and more… lean protein and fiber. Do you think you could commit to those changes?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Less cheese and chocolate will be hard, I won’t lie. But I can try. I really don't want to take medicine if I don't have to. So, I'm willing to work on the exercise and the food. More walking, maybe look for a yoga class again… and try to eat more fish. What kind of fish is best? I hear some fish have… things in them you don’t want. Is salmon good?
DOCTOR: Salmon is an excellent choice. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health. Avoid larger, predatory fish like swordfish or tilefish, as they may contain higher levels of mercury. Now, regarding your cholesterol, I’d like to repeat the lipid panel in three months to assess your response to lifestyle changes. If your numbers haven't improved sufficiently, we may need to consider a statin medication. It's crucial to understand that statins are not without potential side effects, though they are generally well-tolerated. We’ll discuss those in detail if and when the time comes. But, for now, let’s focus on diet and exercise. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, salmon sounds good. I like salmon. And I understand about the medicine… I’d rather not take it if I can help it. So, three months and see if things get better. One question… is there anything else I should be doing? Like, any special foods to add to my diet, besides the salmon? And how much walking is enough? I don’t want to overdo it, but I want to make sure I’m doing enough. I just… want to get this under control.
DOCTOR: Very well. Beyond the salmon, incorporating more soluble fiber into your diet is beneficial. Oats, beans, apples, and citrus fruits are good sources. Regarding walking, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. That equates to approximately 30 minutes most days of the week. However, you should listen to your body and avoid overexertion. If you experience chest pain or shortness of breath, stop immediately and consult your physician. Now, I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for three months. We will repeat the lipid panel and assess your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, do not hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Oats, beans, apples… salmon, walking… I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. Three months, and I'll see you then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Geho. I trust you will adhere to the recommendations. Have a pleasant day.
