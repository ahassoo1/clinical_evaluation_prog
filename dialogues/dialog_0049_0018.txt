DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the restroom… quite a lot. More than usual, you understand. It’s been going on for a little while now, but I thought it might just be… something I drank, perhaps. But it hasn’t stopped.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And for how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… approximately… that’s a difficult question. It feels like… several weeks, at least? Maybe a month? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I don't keep very good track of these things. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And is it… just frequency, or are you experiencing any urgency?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. Yes, I believe so. It’s not a gradual need, if you understand. It just… comes on rather suddenly. I have to go now, you see. It’s not a comfortable feeling, I assure you. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, just… inconvenient. Very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Sudden onset urgency… and no pain. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Oh… that's a good question. I haven't really… looked, if I’m being truthful. I suppose… no, I don't think so. It looks… normal, as far as I can recall. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I apologize, I’m not very observant.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verbos. Many people don't pay close attention. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or back pain alongside this increased urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever, no chills… and definitely no back pain. I feel perfectly well otherwise, aside from the… the constant need to visit the restroom. It’s just… unsettling. I’m not a young man anymore, you see, and these things tend to worry one. Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Difficulty… hmm. Not exactly difficulty, no. It’s not a weak stream, if that’s what you mean. But sometimes… sometimes it takes a moment to start, if I’ve been waiting a while. Just a little hesitation. Is that what you meant by difficulty? It’s not painful, just… a bit delayed.
DOCTOR: A little hesitation. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, or have you ever had any prostate problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s another thing I’m not very good at remembering, I’m afraid. I believe I had… a touch of pneumonia years ago, but I recovered fully. As for diabetes… I don’t think so. My doctor – Dr. Havelka, back in the Czech Republic – he never mentioned anything. And prostate problems… I honestly don't know. I’ve never had any specific tests for that, if that makes sense. I'm on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, but they don’t seem to focus on… that area. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, years ago… no known diabetes or prostate issues. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medications if I can. I believe in a healthy diet and… well, simply being sensible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just the occasional multivitamin. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily unusual, Mr. Verbos. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your abdomen and do a digital rectal exam. It will give us some more information. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh dear. Well, if you believe it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose so. I’m not particularly fond of the idea, but I trust your judgment. I just… I wasn’t expecting that. Please be gentle, if you would. I apologize for my… reluctance. It’s just… a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verbos. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie on your side. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen first. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain… just a little… pressure, perhaps. It’s not uncomfortable, just… I feel your hand, you see. Everything feels… normal, I think. Though I’m not an expert, of course. It’s just… a bit strange having someone poke around, if I’m honest. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Good. Now, I'll need to perform the digital rectal exam. Please let me know if you experience any pain. I’m going to put on a new glove. Just relax as much as possible. Any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes. A little… pressure, again. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. It’s just… an awkward sensation, you see. And… a bit cold. Is it… is it normal to feel this much pressure? I’m really sorry. It’s not that I’m being difficult, it’s just… I’ve never had this done before. Just let me know when it’s finished, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all. It’s finished now. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness. That could explain some of the hesitation you've been experiencing. We'll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test. That will help us rule out infection and assess your prostate health.
PATIENT: Enlarged… Is that… serious, Doctor? Tests… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. Urinalysis, blood count, PSA… I suppose I should schedule those, then? Where do I go, and what do I need to do? I'm not very good at remembering instructions, so if you could write them down for me, I would be very grateful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Verbos. This requisition is for the lab down the street, at 142 Maple Avenue. They accept Medicare, so you won't have any issues with coverage. The instructions are on the back – it says to drink plenty of water before the urinalysis, and the blood test requires you to fast for eight hours beforehand. You can schedule your appointment at the front desk before you leave. We'll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss a plan. It’s likely we’ll want to monitor your PSA levels over time, and potentially consider a referral to a urologist if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: 142 Maple Avenue… Medicare… drink water… fast for eight hours… I think I can manage that. A urologist? Is that… is that because you think it might be something serious? And… monitoring levels… how long is ‘long’? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m a bit anxious, as you can imagine. It’s just… I don't want anything to be overlooked. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be anxious, Mr. Verbos. It’s my job to address your concerns. A referral to a urologist is just a precaution at this stage. Many men experience prostate enlargement as they get older, and it doesn’t always indicate a serious problem. We're simply being thorough. Monitoring your PSA levels over time helps us track any changes and make informed decisions about your care. We’ll typically check it every six to twelve months. It’s important to remember that we don’t have all the information yet. These tests will give us a clearer picture, and then we can determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that answers everything… for now. Thank you. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. And for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I suppose I should go schedule those tests at the front desk, then? I’ll try not to forget the instructions this time. Thank you again, Doctor Nestingen. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting this checked out. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that arise. Have a good day. .
