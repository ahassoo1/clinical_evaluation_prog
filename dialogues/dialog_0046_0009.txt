DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And frankly, it’s rather obvious what brings me in. I’m losing my sight. It’s quite inconvenient, I assure you. Not something one plans for, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, I understand. Losing your sight would be incredibly disruptive. And you are right to seek medical attention. “Quite inconvenient” is a very diplomatic way to put it, and I appreciate you coming in to discuss this with me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about how you’re losing your sight?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as if it happened overnight, Doctor. It’s… gradual. Things just aren’t as sharp as they used to be. More… blurry around the edges, I suppose. And it’s more noticeable when I’m reading. Which, naturally, is a problem. I used to be able to read the newspaper cover to cover without issue. Now… well, now I need to hold it practically under my nose. And even then it's difficult. It’s been going on for, oh, I’d say six months or so. Maybe longer. Honestly, I don't pay attention to such trivial matters unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of blurry vision, particularly with reading, for approximately six months. You mentioned it’s affecting your ability to read the newspaper – is this blurry vision present in both eyes, or is it more pronounced in one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Though… I think it’s a bit worse in my left eye. It’s difficult to say definitively. I haven’t exactly been conducting scientific experiments on myself, you understand. It’s just… a general fuzziness. Everything seems a bit… washed out, if that makes any sense. And it’s not constant. Some days are better than others. Though, naturally, it seems to be getting worse overall. It's all quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Fluctuating blurry vision, worse in the left eye, but present in both. And overall worsening. Thank you for clarifying. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this vision change?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No pain, no spots, no… flashing lights or anything dramatic like that. I haven’t bumped into any furniture more often than usual, if that’s what you’re getting at. My balance seems perfectly fine. No headaches. Honestly, it’s just the blurry vision. It’s rather… singular in its presentation, isn’t it? I suppose that’s a good thing, but I wouldn’t know. I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Alcorta. The absence of other symptoms like pain, spots, or balance issues is certainly good information. No headaches either. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. Recovered perfectly fine, though. Other than that… no, not really. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good steak now and again. And I've always been fairly active. As for those… conditions you mentioned, no. Never been diagnosed with any of them. Though my ex-wife was always convinced I had high blood pressure. She was a rather… anxious woman. It’s probably just a coincidence.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions, past flu illness. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I've always prided myself on my good health. A few minor injuries as a child, scraped knees and elbows, nothing serious enough to require a visit to the hospital. I’ve always been rather careful, you see. One should avoid unnecessary risks whenever possible. It’s a sensible philosophy, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. Prudence is always a good approach. Now, thinking about your family… are there any eye conditions – like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother, she wore glasses, of course. But that was just normal age-related farsightedness, I believe. As for anything… more serious? I honestly don’t know. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. We weren’t a close-knit bunch, you see. My father… well, he wasn’t much for discussing his ailments. And my siblings… we’ve all drifted apart. So, no, I can’t say I’m aware of any hereditary eye conditions. It’s entirely possible they existed, but I simply wouldn’t know. A rather unhelpful situation, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make things a bit more challenging, but we’ll work with what we have. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I find the habit utterly repulsive. And terribly unhealthy, of course. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Or any other form of tobacco, for that matter. I believe in maintaining a clean and healthy lifestyle. It’s a matter of principle, you understand. A man should take care of his body. It’s the only one he has.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Alcorta. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a small scotch on a cold evening. Nothing excessive, mind you. I’m not a heavy drinker. I appreciate a good quality beverage, but I certainly don’t rely on it. It’s more of a social thing, you see. Or simply a way to unwind after a long day. I believe in moderation in all things. It’s a sensible philosophy, wouldn’t you agree? I certainly don't have any… problems with alcohol.
DOCTOR: Yes, moderation is key. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on not needing any. I haven't taken a single pill in… well, I couldn't even tell you how long. I believe in letting my body heal itself naturally. I eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and avoid unnecessary stress. I simply don't see the need for artificial interventions. It's all rather… barbaric, isn't it? Relying on pills and potions to fix what could be solved with a bit of self-discipline. Though, I suppose that’s just my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, thank you for providing me with that thorough information. It sounds like you generally lead a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your vision, I’d like to perform a comprehensive eye exam. This will involve checking your visual acuity, examining your pupils, testing your peripheral vision, and measuring the pressure inside your eyes. It will also involve looking into the back of your eye to assess the retina and optic nerve. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… acceptable. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of things being poked and prodded. But I understand it’s necessary. I suppose if you must, you must. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything as you go along. I like to know what’s happening, you see. I don’t care for surprises. I trust you're a professional. Let's get it over with then. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will explain each step as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things at your pace. First, let’s check your visual acuity. I’m going to ask you to read some letters on this chart. Please cover your left eye with this patch, and then read the smallest line of letters you can see clearly. Don’t worry if you can’t read all of them – just do your best.
PATIENT: Very well. Let's get this over with. Though I suspect my vision isn’t what it used to be. A rather obvious fact, wouldn’t you agree? E… F… P… T… V… Z… Hmm. This is rather small, isn't it? Let me see… N… And… that one looks like a K… though it could be an H. Honestly, these letters are terribly ambiguous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That’s very helpful. And with your right eye covered… please read the letters on the chart. Again, just do your best.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather frustrating. Everything is so… blurry. E… F… P… Hmm. That one looks like a V, or perhaps a T… No, definitely a T. Then… N. And… that one is utterly indecipherable. Is that a K? An H? I simply cannot tell. This is… most unsatisfactory. My vision is clearly deteriorating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils. I’m just looking to see how they react to the light. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t cause any pain. Please try to look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious afferent pupillary defect noted. Some mild constriction noted in both eyes.
PATIENT: Mild constriction, you say? That sounds… concerning. Is that bad? Honestly, Doctor, you’re not filling me with confidence. I trust you’re not about to tell me I’m going blind? I have important things to do, you know. Things that require… vision. This is most unsettling. Proceed, but do try to be quick about it. I don't care for this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Mr. Alcorta. Mild constriction is not necessarily a cause for alarm. It can be perfectly normal. I’m just documenting everything I observe as part of a comprehensive exam. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see a light appear in your side vision. It will be a series of flashes, and you’ll need to press a button each time you see one. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? More flashing lights? Honestly, Doctor, this is starting to feel like a carnival ride. Very well. Proceed. But if I start to see any… unusual patterns, or hear any discordant music, I want you to stop immediately. And please, explain everything as you go along. I don't appreciate being kept in the dark, so to speak. Is this going to take much longer? I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concern, and I’ll explain each step as we go. This test shouldn’t be unpleasant. You’ll be looking straight ahead through this machine, and I’ll be presenting a series of small flashes of light in your peripheral vision. Your job is simply to press the button every time you see a flash of light, no matter how faint. It’s important to keep your head still and maintain your focus on the center point. We’ll start with your right eye. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But if I miss any of these flashes, it's not my fault. This contraption is terribly uncomfortable, and my vision is clearly deteriorating. Don’t expect miracles. And please, be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Now, I’m going to use this instrument to look into the back of your eyes. It allows me to see your retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels. It doesn’t hurt, but it may be a little bright. You’ll need to look straight ahead, and I may ask you to focus on different points. I’m going to start with your right eye. Just relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Bright lights, you say? Just what I needed. Honestly, Doctor, this is starting to feel like an interrogation. Very well. Proceed. But if you see anything… unusual back there, please don’t hesitate to inform me. I have a rather sensitive constitution. And please, be quick about it. I have important things to do, you know. Things that require… good eyesight. Focus on different points, you say? Very well. Lead on. But don’t expect miracles. This is clearly not going to be a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That completes the eye examination. Now, I need a moment to review my findings. Please remain seated and I'll be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Well? What did you see back there? Anything… alarming? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. I trust you're not about to tell me I need surgery? Or some other… invasive procedure? I have important things to do, you know. Things that require… vision. And if this is going to involve a lengthy explanation, I suggest you keep it brief. I have a rather limited attention span. Please, do get on with it. The suspense is killing me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. After reviewing my findings, it appears you have some early signs of age-related macular degeneration in both eyes. Your visual acuity is moderately reduced, and your peripheral vision is slightly constricted. The retinal examination revealed some drusen, which are small deposits under the retina, indicative of this condition. Now, it's important to understand that this is a common condition, especially as we age. And in its early stages, like yours, it may not cause significant vision loss. However, it can progress over time, potentially leading to central vision loss. We need to monitor this closely to ensure that it does not worsen. Fortunately, there are several things we can do to help slow the progression of this condition.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Central vision loss? Slow the progression? Doctor, are you telling me I’m going blind? This is… unacceptable! I have important things to do, you know. Things that require… clear eyesight! What can be done? Surgery? Medications? Some sort of… miracle cure? Don’t tell me there’s nothing you can do. I refuse to accept that! I have a rather active lifestyle, you see. And I certainly don't intend to spend the rest of my days… peering at the world through a fog. What are my options? And be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. This is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, please try to remain calm. I’m not saying you are going blind. As I mentioned, this is early-stage degeneration, and we have options to manage it. Surgery is generally not indicated at this stage. There is no cure for macular degeneration, but we can take steps to slow its progression and preserve your vision. The most effective treatment is a combination of lifestyle modifications and, potentially, medication. Lifestyle modifications include: Diet: Eating a diet rich in antioxidants, such as leafy green vegetables and fish, can help protect your eyes. Supplements: Taking a specific formulation of vitamins and minerals, known as the AREDS2 formula, has been shown to slow the progression of the disease. Smoking Cessation: If you smoke, quitting is crucial. UV Protection: Wearing sunglasses that block 100% of UV rays is essential. In some cases, we may consider injections of medication into the eye to slow the growth of abnormal blood vessels. However, that is not typically recommended in the early stages of the disease. I recommend we start with the lifestyle modifications and the AREDS2 supplements. We will also need to monitor your vision regularly with eye exams to assess its progression. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Supplements? Lifestyle modifications? That sounds… rather inconvenient. And frankly, Doctor, I doubt it will make much difference. I have a rather busy schedule, you see. And I certainly don't intend to spend my days… popping pills and eating leafy green vegetables. What about these… injections? Are they painful? And what are the side effects? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not particularly fond of needles. And I certainly don't want to risk any… complications. And what about these… regular eye exams? How often will I need to come in? And will they be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. I can’t afford to spend a fortune on… medical procedures. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather overwhelmed. This is all quite unsettling. Is there anything… simpler we can do? Some sort of… miracle cure? Or a special ointment? Anything at all? I refuse to accept that I’m going to spend the rest of my days… slowly losing my vision!
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concerns and frustrations. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed by this information. Let me address your questions one by one. The injections are generally reserved for more advanced stages of the disease, when abnormal blood vessels are growing under the retina. They are not typically recommended in your case at this time. While they can have some side effects, such as mild discomfort or infection, they are generally well-tolerated. As for the supplements, they are relatively inexpensive and readily available over the counter. They don't require a prescription, and they can be a valuable tool in slowing the progression of the disease. Regarding the eye exams, we would need to see you every three to six months initially to monitor your vision closely. The cost will vary depending on your insurance coverage. However, we can discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs if needed. Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for macular degeneration at this time. And while there are some experimental treatments under development, they are not yet widely available. The best course of action at this point is to focus on the lifestyle modifications and the AREDS2 supplements. This can help protect your vision and slow its progression. We will monitor your vision closely with regular eye exams to assess its effectiveness. I understand this is not the news you wanted to hear. But I am here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Supplements… eye exams… It all sounds… rather tedious. And frankly, Doctor, I doubt it will make much difference. I have a rather… pessimistic outlook on life, you see. I tend to expect the worst. Very well. I suppose I can try the supplements. And I can schedule some… eye exams. But I’m not making any promises. And I expect you to be… gentle. I don't like being poked and prodded. And what about these… leafy green vegetables? Do I have to eat them every day? And will they taste… terrible? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a rather fussy eater. I prefer steak and potatoes. Very well. I suppose I can try to eat a few… leafy green vegetables. But don't expect me to enjoy them. And please, don't ask me to give up my steak. That's simply… unacceptable. I suppose that's all for now. I trust you'll send me a reminder about these… eye exams. And perhaps a recipe for… leafy green vegetables? Though I doubt I'll use it. Good day, Doctor. I trust I won't need to see you again anytime soon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. I'll send you a reminder about the eye exams and a helpful resource about incorporating leafy green vegetables into your diet. Remember, even small changes can make a difference. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to remain optimistic. We'll do everything we can to protect your vision. Have a good day, Mr. Alcorta. And please, take care.
PATIENT: .
