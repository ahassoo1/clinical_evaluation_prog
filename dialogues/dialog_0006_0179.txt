DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good to meet you too, Doctor… Gorga, is it? It is… the words. They do not come so easy now. I… struggle, you understand? It is very… frustrating. I forget things, but this is different. It is like they are… hiding.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds…difficult. Let's try to figure this out. When did you first notice this trouble with words?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. It was not sudden, you see. It crept up. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It is… hard to say exactly. Things blend together, these days. I do remember… my wife, she noticed it before me. She would say I was… repeating myself. Or using the wrong words.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it's been gradually worsening over the last six months or so, and your wife was the first to point it out. Repeating yourself, using the wrong words… Can you give me an example of what you mean by "wrong words"?
PATIENT: Ah, yes… an example. Let me think… It is difficult to explain. Sometimes, I… I want to say “table,” but… another word comes out. Not the right one. Something… similar, maybe? Or I will be talking about the garden, and… the name of the flower… it escapes me. It is… not a big thing, usually. But it happens more and more. It makes conversation… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty retrieving the right words, mostly when you're speaking. And this is causing you some frustration and making conversations harder. Do you notice this happening more often at certain times of the day, or in certain situations?
PATIENT: That is… a very good question. I do not think so. It seems… random. Sometimes, it is worse when I am tired, perhaps. Or if I am… distracted. But other times… it happens even when I am feeling quite clear-headed. It does not seem to follow a pattern, no. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Random, sometimes worse with fatigue or distraction. Okay. Now, aside from the words, are you having any other difficulties?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Let me see… My memory is not what it was, of course. I forget where I put my glasses, things like that. But that is to be expected, at my age. No… I don’t think so. I can still… manage my affairs, you understand? I live alone now, since my wife passed, but I keep the house tidy, I cook for myself… I do not feel… lost, or confused. Just… the words, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s important to know. You’re able to manage your daily life independently. And no other memory problems besides the word-finding difficulties. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I have glasses, you see. I wear them when I read. Hearing… I do not think so. I sometimes have to ask people to speak up, but I always have, even when I was younger. Balance… no, that is fine. I walk every day, to the shops and back. I do not feel unsteady, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure, for many years. But it is controlled with medication, now. And… arthritis, in my knees. It makes walking a bit painful sometimes, but I manage. Oh, and… I had a small stroke, about ten years ago. It did not cause any lasting problems, the doctors said.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a stroke ten years ago. And the stroke didn't leave any lasting deficits, is that correct?
PATIENT: That is correct. The doctors did many tests, you see. They said I was very lucky. Some weakness on my left side, for a short time, but it went away completely. I still take medication to prevent another one, of course.
DOCTOR: Good. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see... I have my blood pressure pills, Lisinopril, I think it is called. And… a pill for the arthritis, Celebrex. Oh, and… a small blue pill for the stroke, Clopidogrel, the doctor said. And… that is all, I believe. I take them every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril, Celebrex, and Clopidogrel. That matches what I see here. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ah, allergies... No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can recall. I eat most things, I do. Though I do not care for shellfish, but that is a matter of taste, not allergy. No, no allergies to report, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your general health and get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I will do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Just some simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. First, I’m going to have you sit here for a moment. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Look just at my finger, don't move your head. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I am squeezing as hard as I can, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Strong grip on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. This might feel a little strange. Alright. Reflexes are good as well. Last thing, I'm going to ask you to say the days of the week, and then spell the word “world” backwards. Just to check your language skills. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The days of the week… let me see… Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… Thursday, Friday… Saturday, Sunday. Is that correct, Doctor? And… spell "world" backwards… hmm. That is… difficult. Let me think… d-l-r-o-w? No… that does not seem right. d-l-o-r-w? I am sorry, Doctor. It is… escaping me.
DOCTOR: That's alright. Don't worry about it. It’s just a quick test. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with word retrieval and spelling. Given your history of stroke, and the gradual onset of these symptoms, it’s important to rule out any changes in your brain. I would like to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture. It's a non-invasive scan and will help us determine if there's anything going on that could be causing these difficulties. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… you mean a picture of my brain? Is it… dangerous, Doctor? I have heard… things. About those machines. Will it hurt? I… I am not sure I like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests. The MRI is very safe. It doesn’t involve any radiation, and it’s completely painless. You'll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take pictures of your brain. It can be a bit noisy, which is why we offer headphones. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. The main reason we want to do it is to get a better understanding of what’s going on, so we can provide you with the best possible care. It’s the most accurate way to rule out any changes in your brain after your stroke. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I do not understand… magnets, inside my body. And what if… what if it finds something bad, Doctor? Will it… will it need surgery? I am… a bit frightened, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your fear, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. The magnet doesn't actually go inside your body. It creates a strong magnetic field, and that field allows us to see detailed images of your brain. It's like taking a very detailed photograph. Now, as for finding something, it's important to remember that we don't know what we'll find yet. The MRI will simply give us more information. If we do find something, it doesn't automatically mean you'll need surgery. It could be something small that doesn't require treatment, or it could be something that can be managed with medication or therapy. We’ll discuss all of your options carefully, and make a decision together. The technician will explain the entire process to you before the scan, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you have. They will also be able to answer any concerns about metal implants you might have. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule the MRI for you?
PATIENT: I… suppose so. If it will help. But… can my son be with me? He worries about me, you see. And… I do not like being alone in strange places. It makes me… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your son is more than welcome to be with you. In fact, I encourage it. Having someone with you for support is a great idea. We’ll just need him to fill out a brief form beforehand to acknowledge some safety guidelines. Let me see… we have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you and your son?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… yes, I think so. That should be alright. As long as my son can come with me. He works, you see, but he can take a morning off. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And… for letting my son be with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad we could get that scheduled. I'll have my assistant give you a call tomorrow to confirm the details and arrange the paperwork for your son. In the meantime, if you notice any changes in your symptoms – any new weaknesses, dizziness, or severe headaches – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have answered everything I was worried about. Thank you… very much. I will see you… next Tuesday, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. You take care, and don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. It was good meeting you. We’ll get to the bottom of this. My assistant will walk you out. Have a good day.
