DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, really. I have… too much gas. A lot of it. It is causing me some trouble.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay. No need to be embarrassed at all, Mr. Goodstein. It's a very common issue, and we can definitely look into it. “Excessive gas” – that's a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, “excessive” is… a good word. It happens many times during the day. After I eat, mostly. But sometimes even when I haven’t. It… it smells bad, too. I am sorry to be so frank, but it is… noticeable. And sometimes it is painful. Not always, but it can be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, that makes perfect sense. And thank you for being so open with me; it's important for me to get a clear picture of what's going on. So, it happens multiple times a day, primarily after eating, but also at other times. And you've noticed an unpleasant odor, along with occasional pain. Let’s try to get a better understanding of the timing and what you eat. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me think… A typical day… Well, I usually have a small breakfast. Maybe some toast with a little jam. And coffee, of course. Then, for lunch, I work at the fast food place, so usually I eat there. Burgers and fries, sometimes a soda. Not the healthiest, I know. And for dinner… it depends. Sometimes I cook something simple. Pasta, maybe. Or I get something quick, like a sandwich. I do not eat a lot at any one time, if that makes sense. It is more the frequency of the… problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so toast and jam with coffee for breakfast, lunch at the fast food restaurant – burgers and fries, and dinner varies, pasta or sandwiches. You mentioned not eating large quantities, but experiencing the issue frequently. That's helpful. Let's talk about what kind of pain you're experiencing, when you do have it. Is it cramping?
PATIENT: Yes, "cramping" is a good word, Doctor. It feels like… squeezing. In my stomach, mostly. Lower part of my stomach. It comes and goes, but when it happens, it is… uncomfortable. It does not last very long, usually. A few minutes, maybe. It is not a severe pain, but it is… annoying. And embarrassing, of course. I sometimes have to… excuse myself. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Mr. Goodstein. Lower abdominal cramping, squeezing sensation, coming and going, lasting a few minutes at a time. And it's understandably disruptive. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the gas and cramping?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Other symptoms… Well, sometimes I feel a little… bloated. Like my stomach is full of air, even when I haven’t eaten much. And… sometimes, a little heartburn. Not very often, but it happens. I do not have any… changes in my bowel habits, if you know what I mean. Everything is… regular. I hope that is not too… personal a detail.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Goodstein. Those details are important. Bloating and occasional heartburn alongside the gas and cramping. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your bowel movements, which is good to know. Just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any recent weight loss, fever, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss. I have not been sick with a fever. And no nausea, thankfully. Everything is… normal in that regard. I am a little worried about this gas, but I have not felt… generally unwell. Just… gassy. And sometimes crampy. I do hope it is not something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good that you haven't experienced any other concerning symptoms like fever or weight loss. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like we're likely dealing with something functional – meaning it's related to how your digestive system is working, rather than a more serious underlying condition. However, to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and palpate it gently to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it is a good idea, then please do. I trust your judgment. I would like to know what is happening, and if there is anything I can do to make it better. Listening and… palpating… is fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Alright, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, the bowel sounds are… active, within normal limits. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels painful. And… how does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… okay, Doctor. A little pressure, of course, but not painful. It is… slightly tender on the left side, I think. But not sharply painful. Just… a little uncomfortable. Like when you press on a bruise, maybe? Not a severe pain. I do not feel any… lumps or anything like that. It is mostly just… the tenderness.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight tenderness on the left side, no masses felt. That's good information. It could indicate some mild inflammation or sensitivity in that area. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of basic blood tests. A complete blood count – that will check for any signs of infection or anemia – and a comprehensive metabolic panel – that will assess your liver and kidney function. Also, a stool sample analysis to rule out any bacterial overgrowth or parasites. Are you able to collect a stool sample?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I can collect a stool sample, yes. It is not… pleasant, of course, but I can do it. And the blood tests are fine as well. Whatever you think is necessary. It is good to rule things out. So… blood tests and stool sample. And… what happens next? I hope it is not something too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We'll get those orders sent to the lab right away. You can collect the stool sample at home and bring it in when you're ready. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to do it properly. While we wait for the results, I'd like to suggest a few dietary changes that might help alleviate your symptoms. Try to avoid carbonated beverages, beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and artificial sweeteners. Eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. And consider keeping a food diary to see if you can identify any specific foods that trigger your gas. We can discuss the results of your tests and adjust the plan from there. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Avoid the fizzy drinks and… those vegetables. Smaller meals and… write down what I eat. It sounds… manageable. I do not think I have any questions at this moment. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful and… patient with me. I feel a little better just knowing what we are doing to find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things, and I'm happy to work with you to find a solution. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results of your tests. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, such as developing severe abdominal pain, fever, or bloody stools, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here are the lab orders, and a pamphlet on dietary changes for excessive gas. Do you have any work restrictions we should note, or do you need a note for your employer?
PATIENT: No, no work restrictions. I work at the fast food place, it is not… a strenuous job. And no, I do not need a note for my employer. Thank you very much. I think that is everything. I will collect the stool sample and… try to eat better. I appreciate your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, I wish you all the best, Mr. Goodstein. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
