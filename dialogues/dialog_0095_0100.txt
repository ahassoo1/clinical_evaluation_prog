DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something about… checking for things. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. They just told me I needed to come in for it. Is this about work?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s see… yes, I see here you had some blood work done recently. It is related to a routine health screening your employer requires. No need to worry, we'll take it one step at a time. It sounds like we’re going over the results of that blood work. Do you have any specific concerns that prompted the screening, or were you feeling unwell when you had the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, work. Right. I keep forgetting they do that. No, no, I wasn’t feeling sick, exactly. Just…tired, maybe? But I'm always tired. Old age, I guess. I don’t really remember them saying why they were testing me. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, “tired” is good to know. It’s not uncommon to feel fatigued, and many things can cause that. We’re just trying to rule things out. The tests were a pretty standard panel – checking things like your complete blood count, cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function… things like that. Let’s go through them together. First, your complete blood count came back normal – that’s good. That rules out anemia and infection. Your cholesterol is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Do you know what your numbers usually are, if you’ve had them checked before?
PATIENT: Oh, numbers… I… honestly, I don’t. I used to, when my husband was alive, he’d keep track of all that. But… well. It's been a while. I mostly just try to eat okay, you know? Not too much junk food. Does "elevated" mean it's bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright not to remember the numbers, Ms. Hughston. That’s what I’m here for. "Elevated" simply means they’re a bit higher than we'd like to see. It doesn’t automatically mean something is wrong, but it’s something we should monitor. It can be influenced by diet, exercise, and genetics. Your blood sugar was also slightly higher than the normal range. Again, not significantly, but enough to warrant a bit more attention. Have you been told you’re pre-diabetic before, or do you have a family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother had it, I think. Towards the end. She was always going to the doctor. I… don't really know if I've ever been told I was pre-diabetic. I just…try to avoid sweets, mostly. It's a bad habit I picked up, always wanting something sugary, but I try to control it. So, this test… it's checking for that? Like, if I’m getting it too? Is that why I’m here? It’s all a bit confusing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and it is a bit confusing. Yes, part of why you’re here is to see if you’re developing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Your family history and slightly elevated blood sugar do increase your risk. We want to catch these things early, as lifestyle changes can often prevent it from becoming a full-blown condition. The rest of your blood work – kidney and liver function – are all within normal limits, which is excellent. So, overall, we're not seeing anything immediately alarming, but those sugar levels are something we need to address. I’d like to talk about some simple changes you can make, and possibly repeat the blood sugar test in three months to see if it’s improved. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds okay. Three months. I can remember that, I think. Lifestyle changes… What kind of changes? I try, but I'm not very good at cooking for myself anymore. It’s just easier to grab something quick. I don't want to have to give up everything, though. I like a little treat now and then. Is it going to be really hard?
DOCTOR: It won't be really hard, Ms. Hughston, and you definitely don't need to give up everything. It's about making small, sustainable changes. We're not aiming for perfection, just improvement. First, let’s talk about diet. Reducing sugary drinks is a big one – even fruit juice can add up. Swapping white bread and pasta for whole-grain options can make a difference. And portion control is key. I also have some resources here for quick and healthy meals – things you can easily prepare or find pre-made. As for exercise, even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can be beneficial. Do you do any regular physical activity now?
PATIENT: Oh, walking… I used to walk with my husband, every day. But… that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just… get up and move around the house. I do a bit of gardening sometimes, but it's not very regular. It sounds like a lot. I'm not very good at keeping up with things, honestly. I forget what I'm supposed to do half the time. And I get tired so easily. Would it be okay if I just started with one thing? Like, just try to cut back on the sugary drinks?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. That’s a perfect place to start. One small change at a time is much more sustainable than trying to overhaul everything at once. Cutting back on sugary drinks is an excellent goal. We can focus on that for the next three months and then add another change if you’re feeling up to it. We’ll repeat the blood sugar test in August, and if it’s improved, great! If not, we’ll discuss other options. I want you to know I’m here to support you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just cutting back on the sugary drinks… I can remember that. And you said you’ll call if something’s wrong? That’s good. I always worry I’ll forget something important. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. And yes, we will contact you with the results and any recommendations. We’ll also send a summary of our discussion to your primary care physician. Please don’t hesitate to call if you think of anything else. Have a good day, and remember, small steps are still progress. .
