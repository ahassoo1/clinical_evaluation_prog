DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, to be honest. I've been having trouble with my memory lately. Not like, forgetting where I put my keys – it’s more… significant things. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention. It’s never embarrassing to discuss health concerns, especially something that’s causing you worry. “Significant things,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… appointments. I’ve missed a couple recently, even though I thought I’d put them in my calendar. And…names. I’ll be talking to someone and just… the name will slip my mind. It’s not all the time, but it's happening more and more. It's frustrating, and I'm starting to second-guess myself a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Missing appointments and difficulty recalling names…and you said this is a recent change, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely recent. It’s… within the last six months, maybe? It wasn’t happening before that, or if it was, it was so minor I didn’t notice. It’s gotten progressively worse, which is what’s really concerning me. I'm a dentist, you know? I need to remember things! It’s… well, it's important for my job.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. A demanding profession like dentistry requires a sharp memory. Six months… okay. And has anything else changed in your life around that same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not majorly. I… I did start a new vitamin regimen, a friend suggested it for energy. But I’ve been taking those for about three months now, and I can’t say I’ve noticed a huge difference in my energy levels. I haven’t been sleeping great, if that counts. But that’s pretty normal for me, honestly. I’m always a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new vitamin regimen and some sleep difficulties. We’ll definitely explore those. And you said you’re generally a worrier… Is that anxiety impacting other areas of your life, besides your sleep?
PATIENT: Well… yes, I think so. I find myself checking things repeatedly. Like, did I lock the door? Did I turn off the stove? Even though I know I did. It’s just a nagging feeling. And I’ve been a little more irritable, I think. Snapping at people a bit more than usual. It’s not something I’m proud of.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Heidenthal. That's all very helpful information. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm generally pretty healthy. I do have… seasonal allergies, but that’s it. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. Oh, and I wear glasses, obviously. My family… my mother had some heart trouble in her later years, and my father had mild arthritis, but nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history besides seasonal allergies and a past appendectomy. Family history of heart trouble and arthritis. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the vitamins you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, just the vitamins. I really try to avoid taking medications if I can. I’m not a fan of side effects. I take a multivitamin, and then… something for joint health, I think it’s glucosamine and chondroitin. My friend said it helps her knees. I’ve been taking those consistently for about three months, like I said. Honestly, I don’t even remember the full name of it. It was on sale at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm – you've noticed this memory and irritability developing after starting these vitamins about three months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It wasn’t a sudden thing, it was gradual, but I would say it started around the same time I started taking them. Now that I think about it, I did feel a little… off… when I first started. Not sick, just… slightly foggy, maybe? I thought it was just my body adjusting. Should I maybe stop taking them, do you think?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Heidenthal. Before we make any changes, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment—just a few simple tests to assess your memory and reflexes. It’ll help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Yeah, let’s do that. I just want to figure out what’s going on, honestly. It’s a bit scary, not knowing. Blood pressure and pulse are fine, I guess. I haven't really been monitoring them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. It will only take a moment. And then we'll do a few simple memory and balance tests. Your blood pressure is 128/82, which is slightly elevated but not concerning. Your pulse is 72, regular and strong. Now, let's move on to the neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words, and then I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Three words, okay. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, and penny. Please try to remember them. I'll ask you to recall them in a few minutes. Now, I'm going to ask you to count backward from 100 by sevens.
PATIENT: Okay… apple, table, penny. Got it. And… counting backwards by sevens… um… let me see… 100, 93, 86, 79, 72… 65… is it 65? I’m not very good at math. It’s always been my weak subject.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It's a challenging task for many people. You did very well to get as far as you did. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… apple… and… table… oh, and… something with metal… a coin? Was it… nickel? No, that's not right… I’m so sorry, I just… I can't seem to recall the third word. I knew them just a moment ago! It's incredibly frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright. It’s not a test of intelligence, but an assessment of cognitive function. Based on this brief examination and your history, it does appear you are experiencing some memory impairment and difficulty with concentration. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to stress, anxiety, or even a medication side effect, as you suspected. However, it’s also important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or early stages of cognitive decline. I recommend we order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I'd also like to schedule you for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a neurologist… okay. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m a bit scared, honestly, but I appreciate you taking this seriously. If it is something serious… the sooner we know, the better, right? What does the comprehensive assessment involve?
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to get to the bottom of this quickly, Ms. Heidenthal, and that’s exactly what we’ll do. And yes, the sooner we have a clear picture, the better. The comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist will involve a more detailed evaluation of your memory, language skills, attention span, and other cognitive functions. They will also ask about your medical history and lifestyle. It typically takes about an hour or two. I can provide you with a referral to a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any unnecessary stress and getting plenty of rest. And I’m going to advise you to stop taking the multivitamin and joint supplement for now, just to see if it makes a difference. I'll write you a prescription for a Vitamin D supplement. Many people are deficient, and it won’t hurt to address that. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Stop the vitamins, get more rest, Vitamin D… and see the neurologist. Okay. Could you write down the neurologist's name and number for me? I’m terrible with remembering things, as you know. And thank you, Dr. Panjoj. I feel a little better just having a plan. It’s been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Heidenthal. Absolutely. Here you are. Dr. Eleanor Vance. Her number is 555-123-4567. Her office is located on Elm Street, and they take Medicare. Her scheduler’s name is Bethany, and she’s very helpful. I'll also send the lab order to your primary care provider so you can schedule the blood work at your convenience. I want to assure you that many things can cause memory problems, and not all of them are serious. We’re going to investigate thoroughly and figure out what’s going on. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Panjoj. You’ve been very patient and helpful. I really appreciate you listening to my concerns. I'll schedule the blood work and the appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as I can. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time. .
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Heidenthal. You didn’t take up any time at all. It’s my job to listen, and I’m glad you came in. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. It was nice to meet you. I hope you have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
