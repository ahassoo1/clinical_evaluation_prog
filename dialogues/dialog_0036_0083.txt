DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bacy, you say? Well, I don't usually come to doctors unless I absolutely have to, you understand. It’s just… I thought it might be nice to have one of those cards. A "Get Well" card, maybe? My niece, she sends them all the time when I have a little… discomfort. It lifts the spirits, you know? Not that I'm sick sick, mind you. Just...old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it sounds like you're mostly interested in a note for your niece, but there is some discomfort you’d like me to take a look at, just to be sure everything is alright?
PATIENT: "Take a look"? Doctor, I’ve been a stationary engineer for thirty years. Thirty years! I fix things, I don't need looking at. But… alright, alright. My knees. They bother me sometimes. Especially when the weather changes. And, well, getting up in the mornings. It's not a crippling pain, if that's what you're thinking. Just… stiff. Like an old machine that needs a little oil. But don't go poking around too much, understand? I don't want any unnecessary… fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee stiffness, particularly with weather changes and in the mornings. And you'd prefer I keep the exam fairly minimal. I can absolutely do that. To get a better understanding of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, it’s not a sharp pain, if that makes sense. More of a… dull ache. Like a constant reminder that I’m not twenty years old anymore. It doesn't shoot, doesn't tingle, doesn't do anything dramatic. It’s just… there. And it’s worse when I stand for a long time. Or when I try to… well, bend down. You know. Like an old man does. Don't go expecting anything exciting, Doctor. It's just old age creeping up on me. And frankly, I don’t see what a card is going to do about that.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, worse with prolonged standing and bending. No shooting or tingling pain. Alright. And has this been a gradual onset, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, Doctor, definitely gradual. It didn’t just happen overnight, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s been… well, a few months, maybe? Getting a little worse with each passing cold front. It's not like I woke up one morning screaming in agony, understand? It just… slowly became more noticeable. Like rust on a good machine. You know, how things just wear down over time. Honestly, I suspect it’s just my body telling me to slow down, which is a message I’ve been ignoring for far too long. Now, about that card… are we getting anywhere with that?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Kammer. I want to make sure we rule out anything serious before we focus on a card, but I understand your main concern is just having something to lift your spirits. So, aside from the ache, have you noticed any swelling, redness, warmth, or any difficulty bending your knees fully?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not really. Maybe a little… puffiness sometimes, but nothing you’d notice. Redness? No. Warmth? No, they just feel…old. Like they've seen better days. And difficulty bending? Well, yes. A little. It's not like I can’t bend them at all, mind you. But it’s not as…smooth as it used to be. It’s like there’s a little resistance, you know? Like I need to… encourage them to move. It's not a dramatic thing, Doctor. Really. Are we going to spend all day talking about my knees? I just want a card! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Kammer. I’m just trying to get a full picture. So, no swelling, redness or warmth. Some puffiness, and a little resistance when bending. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your knees – a twist, a fall, anything like that?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm… Well, let me think. Thirty years as a stationary engineer…you pick up a few bumps and bruises here and there. Nothing serious, mind you. I remember one time, years ago, I slipped on some oil. Landed pretty hard. But I walked it off. Another time, I twisted my knee getting under a boiler. But again, nothing major. Just a little… ache for a few days. I wouldn't call those injuries, exactly. Just… occupational hazards. People get hurt on the job, you know? It’s part of life. But those were a long time ago. And I haven’t had any trouble with my knees since…until now, of course. But I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s just old age. You can’t fix old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, some minor slips and twists in the past, but nothing that required medical attention at the time. Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Heavens no. My mother had that. Horrible thing. No, I haven’t got arthritis. Diabetes? No. I watch what I eat. Mostly. I try to, anyway. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on something…a little pill. But that’s under control now. Haven't been to a doctor in years except for a quick check-up. Honestly, I mostly just take that pill and try to ignore everything else. Are you writing all this down? You’ll need a whole book! Now, about that card… I’m starting to think you’re deliberately avoiding the subject.
DOCTOR: I am writing everything down, Mr. Kammer. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. You're on medication for blood pressure, which is well controlled. Now, before we talk about a card, I just want to quickly examine your knees, just to rule out anything more serious. It’ll just be a quick look and feel. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Examine? Now you want to examine them? After all this talk? Honestly, Doctor, I came here for a card, not a physical! But… alright, alright. A quick look, you say? A quick look. Don’t go poking around too much, understand? And if it gets uncomfortable, I want you to stop immediately. This whole thing is ridiculous. A grown man having his knees examined for a "Get Well" card! But… fine. Do your quick look. And then…can we please get to the card? I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. Just a quick look and feel. I'll be gentle. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t go expecting miracles, Doctor. They're just old knees. Old, stiff, and probably full of rust. Hurry up, will you? I haven't got all day. And don’t go pulling on anything. I might just get up and leave.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling for any tenderness or swelling. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little! Right there, on the front. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like you're poking a bruise. Honestly, Doctor, you're making it worse. Are you sure you know what you're doing? My grandmother could do a better job, and she's been dead for twenty years! This is ridiculous. Just… leave it alone, will you? It hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m stopping. I felt some tenderness on the front of your right knee. No swelling that I can see, but that tenderness is important. And when you bend your knees, do you feel any clicking or locking?
PATIENT: Clicking? Hmm… sometimes, yeah. A little click when I stand up. It doesn't hurt, it's just… a noise. Like an old machine needing some oil. I don't know. It’s probably just old age. Everything’s creaky these days. Now look, are we getting closer to the card or are you just going to keep poking and prodding? This is getting uncomfortable. And frankly, a little insulting. I came here for a simple thing, and you're turning it into a whole medical drama! I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home and sent myself a card.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Kammer. I apologize. I got carried away with the examination. Based on what you’ve told me – the tenderness on the front of your right knee, the clicking sound when you bend, and the history of minor twists – it sounds like you likely have some early signs of osteoarthritis. It’s very common, especially as we get older. It doesn’t necessarily require extensive treatment at this point, but it explains the stiffness and discomfort you’re experiencing. The good news is, we can manage it. Now, about that card… I’m happy to write you a note. Would you like me to write something specific, or just a general "Get Well" message?
PATIENT: Finally! See? That wasn't so hard. You're telling me it's just old age? I knew it. A little osteoarthritis… that's all? And yes, please write a card. A “Get Well” message will do just fine. Maybe something about…taking it easy and resting. And maybe a little encouragement, you know? Something to cheer up my niece. She worries too much. Thank you, Doctor. And frankly, you’re lucky I didn’t just send myself a card to begin with. Now, can I go? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. "Dear [Niece's Name], I'm sending you this card to let you know I'm doing alright. Just taking it easy and getting some rest. Tell you what, I’m thinking of taking a little nap later! Don’t you worry about me. Wishing you all the best. Love, [Your Name]". Here you are. I'll also print out a brief summary of our visit for your records, mentioning the osteoarthritis and recommending gentle exercises and avoiding strenuous activity. And yes, you can absolutely go. I’m glad I could help, even if it took a little longer than expected. If the discomfort worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Kammer.
PATIENT: .
