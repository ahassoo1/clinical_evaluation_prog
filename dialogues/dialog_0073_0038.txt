DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need to put some things in writing, just in case. Something about… future care? I was advised to inquire about an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. I don’t entirely recall who suggested it, or why precisely, but it seemed… important.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive… right. Well, that’s… proactive of you, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, it’s a bit unusual to be thinking about these things. Still. Let’s start with this feeling that something is “difficult to explain.” Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: It’s… fragments, Doctor. Memories aren’t… solid. I recall a period of illness, some time ago. And… discussions. Vague discussions about choices, should something… happen again. But the details… they slip away. I know I want to be clear about what I’d want, but constructing that clarity is… proving difficult. It feels like trying to grasp smoke. And I apologize, I’m likely being quite… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Fragmented memories… yes. And a prior illness. Well, it’s not uncommon for recollections to fade over time, especially if it was a stressful experience. But attempting to construct legal documents based on “slipping away” details isn't particularly useful, is it?
PATIENT: I understand your concern, Doctor. It is frustrating. I hadn’t anticipated… such difficulty in articulating it. Perhaps… could you explain what these forms entail, precisely? What sort of decisions would they cover? And… if my recollections are so… unreliable, is it even possible to create a useful document? I wouldn’t wish to burden anyone with ambiguity.
DOCTOR: Very well. An Advance Directive, broadly speaking, allows you to specify your wishes regarding medical treatment if you become incapacitated and unable to communicate them yourself. It covers things like life-sustaining measures – ventilation, feeding tubes, resuscitation. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more immediate. It’s an actual medical order, based on your current condition and wishes, outlining what treatment you do or do not want. As for your… unreliable recollections, it's problematic. A vague directive is worse than none at all. We need clarity, and if you can't provide that, we may need to explore other options. Have you spoken with family about these wishes, even in a general sense?
PATIENT: I… divorced, Doctor. Several years ago. And… my family is… distant. Very distant. We haven’t been in contact for quite some time. That’s… another reason I’m attempting this independently. I hadn’t considered whether a vague directive was… detrimental. I simply thought it better than nothing. Perhaps you’re right. Is there… a way to start with something small? A less… comprehensive form, perhaps? Or a process to… jog my memory? I recall a great deal of anxiety surrounding these discussions previously. It may be the root of the… gaps.
DOCTOR: Distant family… complicates things. Anxiety… well, that’s not uncommon, but it doesn’t excuse a lack of concrete information. There are simpler forms, yes, typically focusing on a designated healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf. However, that requires identifying someone suitable, which you've already indicated is difficult. Let's start with a basic review of your medical history. Have you been hospitalized recently?
PATIENT: Recently… no. Not recently. But… several years ago. Approximately five years ago, I believe. For… pneumonia. A severe case. It required… a lengthy stay. And… ventilation, as I recall. That was… the period I alluded to earlier. The discussions. The… anxiety. It was a small hospital, in… well, I don’t recall the town specifically. Somewhere rural. I’ve actively avoided revisiting that period, truthfully. It… wasn’t pleasant. And I apologize for my vagueness. I truly am trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Five years ago, severe pneumonia requiring ventilation… rural hospital, unknown location. This is… frustrating. Do you have any records from that hospital?
PATIENT: No. I… I don’t. I requested them at the time, but… there were complications. Bureaucratic issues, I believe. And… I moved shortly afterward. Attempting to distance myself from… everything. I have no contact information for the hospital, and… frankly, I haven’t actively sought it. I simply… tried to move forward. I realize this is proving… remarkably unhelpful. Perhaps I should simply abandon the idea. It seems… futile.
DOCTOR: Futile, perhaps. But we shouldn't give up entirely. Ms. Buoniconti, if you were to become incapacitated today, and we had no information about your wishes, we would be legally obligated to follow the standard protocols, which may not align with what you would prefer. Do you understand the implications of that?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I believe I do. Standard protocols… meaning… life-sustaining measures, even if… I would not wish them? Even if I had expressed… a different sentiment previously? That is… unsettling. If that is the case… perhaps we should focus on establishing a healthcare proxy, despite my… lack of close contacts. Even someone… vaguely familiar with my preferences? Is that a possibility? It would be… preferable to leaving it entirely to chance.
DOCTOR: A healthcare proxy… marginally better than nothing. It requires a thorough vetting process, of course. We need someone who understands your values, and who can advocate for your wishes, even if they disagree with them personally. Do you have anyone – a former colleague, a distant acquaintance, even a neighbor you trust – who might be suitable?
PATIENT: A former colleague… perhaps. Ms. Anya Petrova. We worked together at the etching studio, several years ago. She’s… quite pragmatic. And… surprisingly steadfast. I haven’t spoken to her in some time, but… I recall her being a sensible individual. She might… be willing to listen. I have her email address, I believe. Though I haven't contacted her since… the divorce. Would that be… a viable option? I can attempt to reach out to her, if you believe it’s worth pursuing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Anya Petrova… former colleague, etching studio. Pragmatic and steadfast… acceptable qualities. Yes, that is a viable option. Contact her, and see if she is willing to discuss this with you. If she agrees, we will need her to complete a formal proxy designation form, and we can discuss your wishes with her present. I’ll provide you with the necessary paperwork. In the meantime, I'd like to perform a basic physical exam, just to establish a baseline. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… reasonable. A physical exam is… sensible. And contacting Ms. Petrova… I will do that immediately. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. Please, proceed with the exam. I suppose the sooner we begin, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Neurological function appears intact. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal at this time. However, this is simply a snapshot. We'll need to monitor your health regularly.
PATIENT: That… is reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. A snapshot, you say? Yes, that makes sense. Given my… fragmented recollections, and the lack of family support, would it be prudent to schedule a follow-up appointment with a neurologist? Perhaps they could assist in… clarifying some of the gaps in my memory? I understand it's a long shot, but… it might be worthwhile, if there's any possibility of retrieving useful information.
DOCTOR: A neurologist… while not entirely unwarranted, I’m hesitant. Your neurological exam was perfectly normal. Referrals should be based on findings, not vague anxieties. However… given your persistent concerns, and the potential legal implications, I will write a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s a highly respected neurologist in the area. But I must emphasize, I don't anticipate she will find anything significant. It's more to rule out any underlying pathology. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I understand your reservations, and I appreciate you accommodating my request nonetheless. Dr. Reed… I will schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. Allergies… no, none that I am aware of. No known drug allergies, and no environmental sensitivities. I… I haven't experienced any allergic reactions in my life, thankfully. Is there anything else you require? Perhaps a list of questions to prepare for Dr. Reed? Or… any specific information I should gather beforehand?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just be prepared to provide a detailed medical history, as you have with me. And be honest about your memory lapses. It’s crucial. I’ll have my assistant schedule the referral to Dr. Reed and provide you with the necessary paperwork. We've covered the basics for today. I recommend you contact Ms. Petrova as soon as possible, and schedule your appointment with Dr. Reed. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been… most thorough. And I appreciate your patience, despite my… unhelpful recollections. I will contact Ms. Petrova immediately, and schedule the appointment with Dr. Reed. Thank you again for everything. I will… see you at my follow-up appointment, then? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti. We’ll see you at your follow-up. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. Have a good day.
