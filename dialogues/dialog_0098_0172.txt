DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, really. It’s just…a formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you understand. Medicare requires these…check-ins. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. Perfectly. But do get on with it, dear. I have errands.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A new patient visit is always a good idea, even if you're feeling well. It helps us get a baseline and ensure everything is as it should be. And Medicare does have its requirements. Let’s start with a little bit about why you decided to come in today, even if it's just for a check-up. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I’m not ill. Just…old. Things ache, naturally. It’s the price one pays for a long life, you know. I simply don’t have time for a detailed accounting of every little creak and groan. Is this going to take very long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand. We don’t need a detailed accounting. Just trying to get a sense of anything new or concerning. And I'll certainly try to be quick. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My…medical history? Really? Do you expect me to recall every sniffle and scrape from the last eight decades? Honestly. I’ve lived a full life, dear. There have been…things. Doctors, hospitals. The usual. I'm quite certain it's all on record somewhere. Is this clinic unable to access my previous files? It would save us both a great deal of time.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. Let me just pull up your records… Ah, here we are. It seems we have some information from your previous physician. However, it’s a bit sparse, and it’s always helpful to confirm details. I see here you were treated for hypertension several years ago. Is that still being managed?
PATIENT: Hypertension…yes, that sounds right. Something about salt, I believe. I do try to limit my intake, though my cook…well, she has her own ideas. It was a while ago, dear. A very long while. Honestly, I haven’t given it much thought. I take a little pill when I remember, I suppose. Is that sufficient? I really must stress, I don't enjoy dwelling on unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're aware of it. Sporadic medication can sometimes make it harder to control. Do you know the name of the medication you are taking?
PATIENT: The name? Good heavens, no. I leave all that to the pharmacist. Little white pill, I believe. Perhaps with a slight…coating? Honestly, I have far more important things to occupy my mind than memorizing the chemical composition of my prescriptions. It's a small, round pill. Do you need me to describe the shape in more detail? This is rather tedious, you know.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. We can often identify it if you bring the bottle with you next time. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? I’m a perfectly healthy woman! I eat everything. Well, almost. I don't care for shellfish. It's…common sense, really. But allergies? No. Absolutely not. Though…there was that unfortunate incident with the roses, decades ago. But that was a rash, hardly an allergy. Really, dear, are we going to catalogue every minor irritation I’ve experienced in my lifetime? I'm beginning to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known drug allergies. Good to know. Just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the hypertension we discussed?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Honestly, I’ve lost count. A minor procedure on my knee, I believe. And…something with my gallbladder, decades ago. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. Hospitals… countless. Pneumonia, a broken wrist…the usual ailments of a long life. It was all very long ago, dear. Before your time, I’m certain. Are we nearing the end of this…interrogation? I have a luncheon appointment. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close. Just a few more questions. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family history? Really? Do you expect me to provide a genealogical chart? My mother lived to be ninety-two, if that’s of any interest. And my father…well, he was a robust man. Though he did succumb to a rather nasty bout of influenza. Beyond that…there were aunts, uncles, cousins. A large family. All…quite ordinary, really. I fail to see the relevance of this line of questioning. Are we quite finished? I truly must be going. This is taking far too long. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your frustration. Given your history, and the fact that you’re feeling well, I won’t press for a lengthy family history. Just to complete the picture, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
