DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up something awful. Been happening for a few days now, and it's getting harder to walk on it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling in the foot that's worsening and making it difficult to walk. Could you tell me a little more about when this started exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it was maybe Tuesday? Yeah, Tuesday morning I noticed it felt a little tight, like my shoe was too small. But it didn't hurt hurt, you know? Just uncomfortable. Then yesterday it was bigger, and this morning… well, look at it!
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Thank you for showing me. So it began with a feeling of tightness on Tuesday, progressed to noticeable swelling yesterday, and is now quite pronounced this morning. Has anything specific made it better or worse since Tuesday?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I tried putting my foot up, like my sister always says, but didn’t seem to do much. Walking makes it worse, obviously. Sitting still doesn't fix it, but it doesn’t get worse if I stay off it. I haven’t done anything to cause it, not that I remember. No falls or anything. Just woke up with a tight shoe feeling, and then… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no specific injury, no falls, and elevating hasn't provided significant relief. And walking exacerbates the swelling. Have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of your foot?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. It looks kinda reddish, I think? Not bright red, but… yeah, a little redder than my other foot. And it feels… warm, yeah, warmer. Not hot, but definitely not cold. It’s hard to tell, though, ‘cause it’s been hot lately, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Redness and warmth can be important indicators. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Not a bit. I feel okay, otherwise. A little tired, maybe, but I'm sixty years old, Doctor. Being tired comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: That’s very true. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I get a little high blood pressure sometimes, the doctor told me, but I take a little pill for it. That’s it, really. I don't really go to the doctor much, unless something really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you recall the name of that medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill… Ugh, I hate remembering names. My daughter handles all that stuff usually. I think… is it Lisinopril? Yeah, Lisinopril. She fills it every month. Pretty sure that’s it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I eat everything. Insects don’t bother me much, either. I lived in Somalia for a long time, you get used to things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam of your foot and ankle. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I just hope it doesn't hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m palpating your ankle and foot now. There is tenderness here, along the outer malleolus… and here, along the arch of your foot. Your range of motion is slightly limited due to the swelling and pain. And the dorsalis pedis pulse is present and feels normal. The swelling appears to be localized, and your skin temperature is slightly elevated in the affected area. No visible signs of open wounds or skin breakdown. Now, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to discuss a few imaging options. An X-ray would help us determine if there is a fracture or other bone abnormality. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yeah, alright. If it helps find out what’s wrong, sure. I don't like being poked and prodded, but if you think it's a good idea… go for it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll get an order for an X-ray right away. The technician will take a few images of your foot and ankle. After the X-ray, we’ll review the results together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your foot as much as possible and avoiding putting weight on it. I'll also prescribe a short course of anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce the swelling and pain. Just one more question, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! Sometimes I take a little thing for my heartburn. Just when it’s bad, though. It’s… Tums, I think? Just the regular Tums. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I forget to take it half the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's very helpful. While we wait for the X-ray results, I would like to emphasize the importance of keeping your foot elevated and minimizing weight-bearing. If the pain worsens significantly, or you develop any fever or chills, please seek immediate medical attention. Now, I’ll go ahead and put in the order for the X-ray and the prescription. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just get it fixed, Doctor. It's hard to get around like this.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. I will let you know as soon as the X-ray results are available. The technician will be in shortly to take the images. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know if you have any concerns.
