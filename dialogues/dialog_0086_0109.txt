DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… the back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not real bad all the time, but it’s there. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm, a dull ache at the back of your head for three days. Okay. And is this a new thing, or have you experienced headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, no… not like this before. I get little headaches sometimes, with stress, maybe? But this is… different. It’s in the back. And it doesn’t go away with… with resting, really. Just stays.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say it doesn't go away with resting, can you tell me anything that does make it better, or worse?
PATIENT: Well… nothing makes it better. Not really. Sitting makes it… not worse, I guess. But standing for too long… that feels a little bit worse. And… loud noises. Loud noises don’t help, for sure. Working… working makes it worse. I still go to work, you know. Gotta. But it’s harder when I’m out there.
DOCTOR: Okay. You said working makes it worse – what kind of work do you do, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: I work on the trains. Rail yard work. Dinkey operator, mostly. And… hostlers. Moving the cars around, you know? It’s… it’s a lot of shaking. And… sometimes heavy lifting. Been doing it a long time. Sixty years, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… that’s a considerable amount of physical work. And the shaking… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I’m supposed to be tired. No… no dizziness. No blurry vision. Just… the headache. And feeling old, which is normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this headache?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And no… I haven’t thrown up. Nothing like that. I eat okay. Maybe not as much as I used to, but… I get by. It's just... this pain. It’s bothersome. Makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history, Mr. Brum. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Old age, I guess? A little arthritis in my hands and knees, but that's just getting old. I had… a bad flu, maybe ten years ago. And broke my wrist when I was younger, falling off a ladder. But… nothing serious. No heart trouble, no diabetes. Nothing like that. No insurance, either. Never could afford it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Doctor gave me some pills for the flu, years ago… didn’t bother me none. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take much medicine, though. Don't like it. Makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… sometimes a little cream for my hands, when they get real sore from the work. But that's it. Just the ache… I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological exam to see if we can pinpoint where that pain is coming from. Will that work?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that’s fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just hoping you can figure out what's wrong with my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 85. Not terribly concerning given your age, but something we'll keep an eye on. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little uncomfortable. Just relax. Balance seems steady, although a little slow. Coordination is… also a little diminished. Now, I’m going to feel around the back of your head where you're experiencing pain. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm… there is some tenderness right here, along the base of the skull. Nothing alarming, but worth noting. Do you feel pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s it! Right there. A little bit of a sharp pain. Not terrible, but… yes, that’s where it hurts. Like a… a knot, almost. It's been getting worse the last few days, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems you have some tenderness and muscle tension at the base of your skull. Given your history of physical work and the nature of the pain, it's likely a muscle strain or tension headache. However, given your age, and the fact that this is a new symptom, I would like to order a CT scan of your head just to rule out anything more serious. It’s just a precaution, Mr. Brum. Better to be safe than sorry.
PATIENT: A CT scan…? What's that…? I don't know nothing about CT scans. Is that… is that dangerous? And… how much will that cost? I don’t… I don’t have a lot of money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is an X-ray of your head, but it provides a much more detailed image. It's not particularly dangerous; the amount of radiation is minimal, and we take precautions to minimize it. It’s the best way to rule out anything serious, like a bleed or a tumor. As for the cost… I understand your concerns. It is expensive. I’ll speak with the hospital to see if we can arrange some financial assistance, perhaps a payment plan, or a discount for uninsured patients. It’s possible we can find something. Do not worry about the cost right now, Mr. Brum. We'll figure it out. Let’s focus on getting the scan done first. It’s important to get this checked out, and I’m here to help you through it.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that’s… good. Financial assistance… that would be a blessing. Thank you, Doctor. I trust you. If you think it’s best… then I’ll do the scan. Just… just let me know when and where. And… and how much it might cost, even if it’s just a guess. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I’m going to write you a referral for the CT scan, and the hospital will contact you to schedule an appointment. They can also discuss the costs and payment options with you. I'll also have my assistant, Maria, call you tomorrow to follow up and see if you have any trouble scheduling. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with the tension in your neck and head. It's not a strong medication, but it might provide some relief. And I recommend you try to rest as much as possible and avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the scan. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Muscle relaxant… okay. Just… is it safe? I don't want to feel… sleepy or confused. I need to be able to think. And thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind. Maria calling tomorrow… that’s good. That’s very good.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness in some patients, but it’s usually mild. I’m prescribing a low dose to minimize that risk. If you do feel overly sleepy or confused, do not operate heavy machinery or drive. Just rest. If the drowsiness is severe or bothersome, stop taking the medication and call my office. I’m going to also give you a handout with some simple stretches you can do to relieve tension in your neck and shoulders. It won't cure the pain, but it might help a little. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns, Mr. Brum. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, after you’ve had the scan, to discuss the results. Does Tuesday at 10 am work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… yes, that’s fine. That works. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. And for being so patient with me. It’s… it's nice to have someone who listens. I think that’s all my questions. I’ll take the medication and try to rest. And I’ll call if I have any problems. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. You take care now. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Maria will be in touch tomorrow. We'll see you next Tuesday. And remember to rest.
