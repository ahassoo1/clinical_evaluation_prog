DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my head. Been getting these headaches. Really bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart feels like it’s going a mile a minute. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s been happening on and off for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches. And you're getting sweating and a fast heart rate with the headaches. That is… good information. “On and off for a bit now” is a little vague, though. Can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Vague is… kind of my default, I guess. Let me think… Hmm. It’s been… maybe six months? Could be a little more, could be a little less. It started… after my divorce, I think? Everything was a bit of a blur back then. They don't happen every day, more like… once or twice a month? Sometimes longer between them. It’s hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Six months, associated with a stressful life event... alright. And once or twice a month, sometimes longer. Can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: They’re… just really intense. Like a throbbing, right behind my eyes and in my temples. It feels like someone’s tightening a band around my head. And it’s not just a dull ache, it’s… sharp, sometimes. It makes it hard to focus, even look at bright lights. Usually on one side, but not always. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain a headache, y'know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Throbbing, behind the eyes, temples, sometimes sharp, one-sided, sensitivity to light… We’re getting a good picture. Do you have any nausea or vomiting with the headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… yeah, sometimes. Not usually vomiting, though. More like a really bad feeling in my stomach. Like I might be sick, but it doesn’t usually come out. And I get really sensitive to noise too, when it’s happening. Everything sounds… amplified, I guess? It's why I usually just lie down in a dark room until it passes.
DOCTOR: Alright, nausea and sensitivity to noise… and you lie down in a dark room. Any other symptoms at all that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think so. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy before it starts, like things are… swaying a little. But that doesn’t always happen. And… oh! I think I get a bit confused too, right before. Like I can’t quite… string a sentence together. But that only lasts a minute or two. It's… subtle, I guess. I didn't even really notice it until you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and confusion before the headache – those are important details, thank you. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t take any medication regularly, either. Just… the occasional painkiller if I get a really bad headache, but that's it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff. Paracetamol or ibuprofen, I think. I can't really remember which one I usually get. They all kind of blur together.
DOCTOR: Right, no allergies, no regular medications… Do you have any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but that healed up fine. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious, nothing that I've ever been to the doctor for, besides check-ups. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. It’s… not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I’ve managed to avoid those so far, thankfully. I’m not very good with hospitals, so I try to stay healthy. Or… I try to. It doesn’t always work out that way, clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Any history of headaches, migraines, or neurological problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mum used to get headaches sometimes, but she just put it down to stress. She worked really long hours. And my grandad, on my dad’s side, he… he had something wrong with his memory when he got older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. Everyone always just said it was “old age.” No one really talked about medical stuff much. I honestly can’t really think of anyone else who had anything similar. It’s… not something we really discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of headaches, but nothing definitive. And let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never really been much of a smoker. I used to drink a bit in college, but I stopped a few years ago. It didn't really agree with me. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I work pretty long hours, to be honest, so I usually just go straight home and collapse after a shift. It's… not a very exciting life, but it's mine.
DOCTOR: Right. And what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Uh… I work in production. Just general… factory work, really. Assembling parts, packing boxes, that sort of thing. It's pretty physical, a lot of standing and lifting. It can be stressful, especially when we're behind schedule. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. I’ve been doing it for about four years now, since I finished school.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me ask one more question for the history. Have you experienced any recent head trauma or injury?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I mean, I bump my head on things sometimes at work, you know, ducking under pipes and stuff. But nothing major. No falls, no knocks, no concussions. Just… the usual workplace mishaps. Nothing that would explain this, I don’t think. It's… been a pretty steady pain, not like something that suddenly started after an injury.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and do a neurological exam. That will involve checking your reflexes, strength, coordination and vision. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fine. Sounds good. I mean, I’m not thrilled about being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… let me know if it’s going to be anything… unpleasant. I’m not great with needles, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, no needles today. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Pulse is good, temperature is normal. Now, let's check your reflexes… Your reflexes and strength seem fine. Your coordination is a little off on the left side, but it’s subtle. Now I’m just going to check your vision and eye movements. Okay, vision is good. Your eye movements are a little jerky, but again, subtle. Everything seems… mostly normal, but those minor findings are worth noting. Do you notice any dizziness or changes in your vision right now?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I mean, I sometimes feel a little dizzy, but I figured that was just me. It comes and goes. I hadn't really noticed anything wrong with my vision. The jerky eye movements… no, I don’t think so. That’s… new information. I usually just try to ignore those kinds of things, if I'm being honest. I’m not one for complaining.
DOCTOR: I understand. The dizziness is something we should keep an eye on, and the jerky eye movements are something I’ll document. Given your history and the exam findings, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be tension headaches, but the nausea, sensitivity to light, dizziness, and subtle neurological findings suggest something more. Migraines are also a possibility, but we need to rule out other causes. I think it’s best to be cautious. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural problems. It's just a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Uh… is that… serious? I mean, what are you looking for? I don’t… I don’t really like the sound of that. It sounds… scary. I was hoping this was just a bad headache thing, you know? Something I could take some pills for and move on from. A CT scan feels… a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It is a bit much, and I apologize for potentially causing you anxiety. But it’s important to be thorough. A CT scan is a relatively quick and painless imaging test. It allows us to see the structures inside your head – your brain, blood vessels, and bones – and rule out any serious problems, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or bleeding. The chance of finding something serious is relatively low, but it’s better to know for sure. Given your symptoms and the subtle neurological findings, I think it’s the most responsible course of action. If the CT scan is clear, we can explore other possibilities, such as migraines or tension headaches, and focus on symptom management. If you're not comfortable with a CT scan right now, we can discuss other options, but they won't provide the same level of information. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of the scan in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explain it to me again. The risks and benefits. Just… lay it all out for me. I’m not comfortable making a decision without knowing exactly what I’m getting into. And… how long does it take? Will it interfere with my work? I can’t really afford to take a lot of time off. I've barely been making ends meet lately.
DOCTOR: Of course. The CT scan itself is a quick procedure, usually less than five minutes. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The machine uses X-rays to create detailed images of your head. You won’t feel anything during the scan, although you might hear some whirring noises. The primary risk of a CT scan is exposure to a small amount of radiation. However, the radiation dose is relatively low, and the benefits of ruling out serious problems usually outweigh the risks. There's also a very small risk of an allergic reaction if contrast dye is used, but we can discuss that further if it’s necessary. As for interfering with work, you can usually return to your normal activities immediately after the scan. You might feel a little tired afterward, but it shouldn’t prevent you from working. It doesn’t require any downtime. We will need to arrange the scan with the radiology department. It may take a few days to get an appointment, depending on their availability. I can provide you with a referral and instructions on how to schedule the scan. Do you have any questions about the procedure or the risks and benefits?
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s quick, but there’s radiation. And I’ll need a referral. And it’ll take a few days to get an appointment. What if… what if they do find something? What kind of something? I’m probably overreacting, but… it’s just a lot to take in. Is there… anything else I could try first? Like, before we jump to a CT scan? Maybe some different medication, or… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. It is a lot to take in, and you're not overreacting at all. Let’s talk about alternatives before we jump to a CT scan. We could try a course of stronger medication to see if it helps manage your symptoms. I could prescribe a triptan, which is often used for migraines, or a muscle relaxant if I suspect tension headaches are the primary cause. However, if your symptoms don't improve with medication, or if they worsen, we'll still need to consider a CT scan to rule out serious problems. The medication will only mask the symptoms if there is something else going on. Another option is to keep a detailed headache diary, documenting the frequency, intensity, and characteristics of your headaches. This can help us identify potential triggers and patterns, which can inform our treatment decisions. Given your concerns, I think the most reasonable approach is to start with a course of medication and a headache diary. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. If your symptoms haven't improved by then, or if they've worsened, we'll proceed with the CT scan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… medication and a diary. That… that sounds better. Less scary. Two weeks… yeah, that gives me time to see if it actually works. What kind of diary? Do I need to write down everything? And what side effects should I look out for with the medication? I don’t want to trade one problem for another.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you feel more comfortable with that plan. For the headache diary, I want you to record the date and time of each headache, the intensity on a scale of 1 to 10 , the location of the pain, any associated symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light or noise, and any potential triggers you can identify – things like stress, lack of sleep, or certain foods. It doesn’t need to be overly detailed, just a concise record of your symptoms. I can print you out a form to help you keep track of everything. I’m going to prescribe you a triptan called Sumatriptan. It's a common medication for migraines. Common side effects include dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. You might also experience a feeling of tightness in your chest or throat, but it’s usually mild and temporary. Important: If you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or signs of a stroke , seek immediate medical attention. I’ll also provide you with a list of potential triggers and some tips on managing your headaches. Do you have any questions about the medication, the diary, or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay… Sumatriptan. Keep a diary. Watch for severe side effects. And… I think that's everything. I mean, it’s a lot to remember, but I’ll try my best. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It definitely makes me feel better. And thank you for not just jumping straight to a scan. I think I'm good for now. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or experience any problems. Here’s the prescription, the diary form, and the list of triggers. The follow-up appointment is scheduled for August 16th. If anything changes before then, or if you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, Jaxston, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate it. Have a good day. .
