DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, frankly, I’ve seen better organized waiting rooms. But never mind that. It's this bruising. I’m on a blood thinner, you see, and I’ve been getting… more of it. It’s not dangerous, I don’t think, but it’s concerning. Old age, I suppose. Though I don't feel that old.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising more easily while on a blood thinner… that’s a good thing to get checked out. And you’re right to be proactive. Just to be clear, when you say “more,” how long has this been happening, and have you noticed any specific events that caused them, or are they just appearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's… hard to say exactly. A couple of weeks, maybe? Three? It all blends together, you know. And no, nothing specific. I haven’t been falling or bumping into things any more than usual. Just… there. On my arms mostly. And my legs. It’s just… bothersome, really. And my daughter, she worries too much, insisted I come in. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything. It’s probably just… well, things slowing down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. We want to rule things out and make sure everything is okay. So, about these bruises… are they painful?
PATIENT: Painful? Not really. A little tender, perhaps, if I press on them. But not like a proper injury, no. It's more…discolored. A sort of purple-ish, you know? Not a nice color, really. It's embarrassing, frankly. I used to be a very… robust man. Now I'm just… bruising.
DOCTOR: Okay, not particularly painful, just discoloration. And you said on your arms and legs primarily. Have you noticed any bruising anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, just the arms and legs. And occasionally on my hands, but that could just be from… gardening, I suppose. I do a bit of gardening, keeps me busy. Though it's not what it used to be, of course. Everything is more difficult now. I maintain a very… tidy garden, you see. Precision is key. Unlike some things these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you mentioned being on a blood thinner… Do you know what blood thinner you're taking, and how long you've been on it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I know what I'm taking. I'm not completely helpless. It's… Warfarin, I think. Yes, Warfarin. And I've been on it… oh, goodness. Since the… incident. That was… five years ago now, I suppose. Five or six. Time really does fly when you're… being bothered by bruises. Honestly, it's mostly just a nuisance. The doctor keeps fussing about my INR levels, whatever those are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for five or six years. Your INR levels are important – they measure how quickly your blood is clotting, and help us make sure the Warfarin dose is correct. That's likely why your doctor has been monitoring them. To get a clearer picture, do you remember the last time you had your INR checked?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep track of these things. My daughter handles most of the appointments and paperwork. She'll have that information, I’m sure. She's very… organized. Perhaps too organized, if you ask me. I think it was… a couple of weeks ago? Maybe three? It was around the time I started noticing the bruising. She probably made a note of it when she scheduled the appointment. I really don’t pay attention to those details. It all just… blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll take a look at the chart. In the meantime, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to take a look at the bruises, and check for any other signs of bleeding. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Though I assure you, there's nothing to see. Just a few harmless bruises. Really. But alright, go ahead. Just try not to poke too much. It's a bit sensitive, you know. And honestly, I have a very important lunch reservation. My friend, Eduardo, he makes the most exquisite ceviche. I shouldn't be kept late.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Nicky. We’ll just take a quick look. I understand about your lunch reservation, and I’ll try to be quick. Okay, I’m seeing several bruises on both your forearms and legs. They vary in size, and they appear to be in different stages of healing, which is consistent with ongoing bruising. There's no swelling or warmth to the skin. I don’t see any other signs of bleeding. Everything else looks normal. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses.
PATIENT: Well, I told you it wasn't anything. A few harmless bruises. Honestly, doctors these days, always making a fuss. My father, he was a very practical man. He’d have just told me to rub some arnica on it and get on with things. But I suppose you have to do something. So, what's the verdict, Doctor? Can I go have my ceviche now?
DOCTOR: While the exam didn't reveal anything immediately concerning, the fact that you're noticing more bruising while on Warfarin does warrant some investigation. It's good that you came in. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your INR levels, of course, to make sure your Warfarin dose is correct. We'll also do a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes of bruising, like low platelets or other blood disorders. I also want to review your medication list to ensure there aren't any interactions contributing to the bruising. And, just to be on the safe side, I'd like to discuss a possible referral to a hematologist, a blood specialist, if the bruising continues or worsens. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hematologist? Blood specialist? Honestly, Doctor, that seems a bit… extreme, doesn’t it? For a few bruises? I tell you, my daughter is going to be insufferable if she hears you say that. She’ll want me getting MRIs and… I don’t know what else. Look, can’t you just… adjust my dose? Or tell me to take some vitamins? I’m a busy man. I don’t have time for all these tests and specialists. And I certainly don’t need to see a… a blood specialist. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. Mostly. Fine. Do the blood tests. But no hematologists. Absolutely not. And if the results are normal, I’m not coming back. And tell my daughter to stay out of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicky. We can start with the blood tests, and I'll review the results carefully. I understand your reluctance to see a specialist at this point, and we'll certainly see what the tests show before we consider that option. We'll also review your medication list to rule out any interactions. I'll write the orders for the blood tests now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they'll take care of it. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any new bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool, or if the bruising gets significantly worse, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… acceptable. Blood tests and a follow-up. No hematologists. Good. And I'll be careful, I suppose. But honestly, I doubt anything will come of it. It's probably just… old age. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important lunch appointment. And I’m starting to lose my appetite thinking about all these… tests. Where is this lab, exactly? And how long will it take? I really shouldn't be late. Eduardo makes the best ceviche you've ever tasted.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just downstairs, to your left. It usually doesn't take too long, maybe 30-45 minutes. The staff there is very efficient. Here's the order form; they'll need this. I'll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment for you before you leave. And I hope you enjoy your lunch. Eduardo's ceviche sounds delicious. It was nice meeting you, Nicky. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. .
PATIENT: Yes, well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Hematologists… Honestly.
