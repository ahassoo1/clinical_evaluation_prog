DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're with Medicare, and the location is urban – quite alright. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's these… episodes. That's what my wife calls them. I get confused. Not all the time, mind you. But enough to worry her, and frankly, it’s unsettling. It’s like… a fog rolls in. I know who I am, generally, but little things… dates, where I put my tools… even sometimes what day it is. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. These “episodes” of confusion are concerning, and it’s wise of your wife to bring you in. It is unsettling to experience that loss of clarity. You say “little things” – can you elaborate on what these “little things” consist of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just last week, I spent a good twenty minutes looking for my trowel. Right there on the workbench, where I always leave it. My wife, she had to point it out. And the day before that, I couldn't remember what job I was supposed to be at. Had to call the office to find out. Simple things, see? Things a working man shouldn’t forget. I’ve been setting tile for forty years, I shouldn’t be losing my mind over a trowel.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's not a complete loss of memory, but rather difficulty recalling recent events or the location of familiar objects. And this has been happening… how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like it happened overnight, Doctor. It's been… creeping up on me, maybe six months now? Started with just misplacing things, then forgetting appointments. At first, I figured it was just age, you know? Getting older. But it's happening more often now, and it worries me. I keep myself busy, always working. A man needs to feel useful. But I worry about messing up a job, or worse, getting lost or something.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening… that's important information. You mentioned feeling useful, staying busy… Do you feel these episodes interfere with your ability to work, or have they during a job?
PATIENT: Well, not yet, thankfully. I'm careful. I double-check everything now. I used to be able to just do a tile job, instinctively. Now, I have to think about every cut, every placement. Slows me down, but I haven't ruined anything completely yet. My wife insists I should just stop, retire. But what would I do? I’m a tile setter, Doctor. It’s all I’ve ever done. And it keeps me sharp, or at least, it used to.
DOCTOR: It's commendable that you're maintaining such awareness and caution. However, relying solely on caution when there’s an underlying cognitive issue isn't a sustainable solution, Mr. Lason. Now, let’s move on to some broader questions. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? What does that even mean? I’m a practical man, Doctor, not a… a flower. I get frustrated when I can’t remember things, of course. Who wouldn't? And I snap at my wife sometimes, probably more than I should. But that’s just… a husband being a husband. It's not like I'm suddenly laughing and crying for no reason. I’m a Khmer man, we don’t do dramatic displays. I just want to know what’s causing these… fogs, and if they’re going to get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand you're a practical man, Mr. Lason. And I apologize if my question was unclear. What I’m trying to ascertain is whether you’ve experienced any notable shifts in your usual temperament or emotional regulation beyond the understandable frustration with these episodes. Have you had any difficulty with tasks that require concentration, like balancing your checkbook, or following complex instructions?
PATIENT: Complex instructions? Well, my wife handles the checkbook. Always has. She’s good with numbers. I do simple calculations on the job, measuring, angles, that sort of thing. But nothing… complicated. I can follow instructions on a job site, but if someone starts rambling on and on with details, I have to ask them to get to the point. Always have. Not new. And as for concentration… sometimes I find myself staring at a wall, just… blank. Doesn’t happen often, but it’s unsettling. Like my mind just… wanders off.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I've got a bit of arthritis in my hands, from years of working with tile. And my doctor – Dr. Heng, back in Long Beach – he’s always telling me to watch my blood pressure. It runs a little high sometimes. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy for my age. I don't smoke, haven’t for thirty years, and I drink… maybe a beer or two with dinner. Nothing excessive. I take a pill for the arthritis, that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, hypertension… and you are currently taking medication for the arthritis. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a white pill. Small, round. Starts with an ‘N’… Naproxen, I think. Yes, Naproxen. 500 milligrams, twice a day. My wife handles refilling it, but I know what it looks like. And I know it helps with the stiffness in my hands, keeps me working.
DOCTOR: Naproxen 500mg twice daily. Very good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not a fan of doctors cutting me open. And I've only been to the hospital once, when I broke my arm as a boy. Fell out of a mango tree. That was in Cambodia, a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve always been able to take care of myself. A bit of ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Now, I need to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Dementia… Alzheimer’s… Well, my mother… she got confused towards the end. Couldn't remember much, wandered off a few times. My wife always said it was just old age. She died a long time ago, back in Cambodia. And my father… he was always a bit… forgetful. But we just thought it was part of getting old. No one really talked about these… diseases, back then. It wasn’t something you discussed openly.
DOCTOR: I see. Maternal grandmother with dementia, paternal family history of forgetfulness… that’s relevant information. And finally, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep alright, maybe a little restless sometimes. My appetite’s good, I haven't lost any weight. And I don’t have any trouble seeing or hearing, other than a little bit of ringing in my ears. It comes and goes. Just the confusion, mostly. And the worry, I suppose. That's been keeping me up a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Based on what you’ve described, and considering your age, family history, and symptoms, I believe a neurological work-up is warranted to determine the cause of your confusion. This will involve some blood tests to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, and likely an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. I'm going to order those tests now.
PATIENT: An MRI? Well… that sounds serious, Doctor. Is it something bad? I mean, I just thought it was… age. My wife worries too much, maybe. What if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it is important to be thorough. An MRI is simply a diagnostic tool. It allows us to visualize the brain and identify any potential causes for your cognitive changes. It doesn’t mean there’s something bad, merely that we’re investigating the possibilities. Many things can cause confusion, and an MRI will help us differentiate between them. I want to be clear: I am not suggesting you have anything to be unduly alarmed about. However, given your concerns, and the progressive nature of your symptoms, prudence dictates further investigation. I will also have a referral sent to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, for a full evaluation. She’s excellent. Here are the orders for your blood tests and the referral to Dr. Sharma. Please schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Well… that's a lot. A neurologist… it sounds expensive. And I'm not sure I like the idea of all these tests. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please explain everything clearly. I don't understand all the medical terms. And I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma, as soon as I can. My wife will be glad to hear we're finally doing something about this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. I assure you, we will proceed with a cautious and measured approach. I will ensure that Dr. Sharma explains the results of the tests in a clear and understandable manner. Medicare should cover the majority of these costs, but my staff will assist you with navigating any potential billing concerns. This brochure provides some basic information about the symptoms you’re experiencing and resources for support. In the meantime, try to maintain a regular routine, get adequate sleep, and engage in mentally stimulating activities. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for the brochure. I’ll show it to my wife. She worries so much. Hopefully, it's just… old age. I’ll get these tests scheduled and see Dr. Sharma. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. If anything arises between now and your appointment, or you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please do not hesitate to contact my office. We will be in touch to follow up on your test results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
