DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my stomach, I guess. It’s been, like, really bothering me lately. A lot of… running to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a bit, and it’s just… not stopping. I’m not really sure why, though. I just… feel off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Running to the bathroom” – that sounds disruptive and uncomfortable. And you said it's been going on for “a bit”. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Really annoying, honestly. Um… a bit… gosh, it’s hard to say exactly when it started. Maybe a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent lately. Like, almost every day, I have to go more than usual. It's not… like, super painful, just… urgent. And a lot of it. Does that make sense? I’m really bad at explaining things sometimes.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jase. No need to worry about explaining – we'll get to the bottom of this together. So, almost every day for a couple of weeks, more frequent bowel movements than usual, and a sense of urgency… Okay. Are you having any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… I’ve been a little tired, I guess. Not like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired, but just… more run down than usual. And… sometimes my stomach feels a bit crampy, but it’s not awful. Oh! And I haven’t been very hungry, which is weird for me. I usually love to eat. I think that's all? It's all just kind of… bleh.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of bowel movements, urgency, some tiredness, mild cramping, and a decreased appetite. Thanks for sharing all that, Jase. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what the bowel movements actually look like?
PATIENT: Oh… um… That's… a bit embarrassing. Let's see… mostly it's… watery. Not solid, definitely. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but it's not really formed. I don't… I don't know how else to explain it. It’s just… not normal. Sorry. I feel silly talking about this. Is this something you normally ask about?
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Jase. It’s my job to ask these kinds of questions—it’s very important information, and you're doing great. “Watery” and “not formed” is helpful. Any blood in it at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I… I don't think so. I haven't noticed anything, but… I don't always look, if that makes sense. I just… try to get it over with. But I haven’t seen anything obvious, no. I'm pretty sure. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible blood, that's good to know. And it’s perfectly understandable you wouldn’t necessarily look, Jase. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And no, I haven’t been sick… no throwing up or anything like that. Just… the stomach stuff. It's weird, because I feel… okay otherwise. A bit tired, but not like I have the flu or anything. I'm just… frustrated, mostly. It’s messing up my day, you know? I have to keep cancelling plans.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting – just the increased frequency, urgency, watery stools, tiredness and frustration. That gives us a good starting point. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… That’s a good question. I… I think I had something when I was a kid? My mom said it was something with my stomach, and I had to eat special foods for a while. She said it was… celiac something? Or maybe Crohn’s? I was really young, so I don’t really remember. I haven’t really had any problems since, so I never really thought about it. Does that… count? I don't even know if I still have it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s really helpful information, Jase. A possible history of celiac disease or Crohn’s as a child… that definitely warrants further investigation. Do you know if you were ever formally tested for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, good question. I really have no idea. Mom would probably know, but… she lives really far away and we don't talk a ton. I remember going to lots of doctors when I was little, and eating weird bread, but… I don’t think I ever got any official results. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… terrible. I feel like I'm always forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific test results available, but a possible history of childhood gastrointestinal issues. That's alright – we'll work with what we have. Let's move on to family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay, let me think… My dad's side, nobody really talked about health much. My mom… she has arthritis, I think? And her sister, my aunt, she… she had some problems with her stomach a few years ago? I remember her being really sick, and having to go to the hospital a lot. She said it was something with her bowels, but I don’t know what it was called. That's all I really know, honestly. Everyone keeps things pretty private.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis and possible bowel issues in your aunt. That's good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke at all. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I’m married, and my husband would kill me if I did! We’re pretty boring, honestly. Just work and try to relax when we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s great to hear. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… Let me see… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. Just when I remember. And I took some ibuprofen a couple of weeks ago for a headache, but that was it. Oh! And I've been taking some probiotics, trying to help with… well, with all this. But other than that, nothing. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches a couple weeks ago, and probiotics. Thanks for sharing all that information, Jase. That gives me a really good overview of your situation. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of gastroenteritis, possibly with some underlying issues given your childhood history and family history. It could be a viral or bacterial infection, or something a bit more chronic like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or even a flare-up of something like Crohn’s. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Tests sound… smart. I just want to figure out what’s wrong and, you know, stop having to run to the bathroom all the time! What kind of tests are we talking about? I'm a little scared of needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Jase. We'll try to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll start with a stool sample – no needles involved with that! We just need you to collect a small sample and bring it in. Then, I'd like to do a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. It's a standard blood draw, and we'll use a small needle. We can also check for celiac disease with a blood test. If the initial tests are inconclusive, we might need to consider a colonoscopy to get a closer look at your intestines, but we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, a stool sample and a blood test… I can probably handle that. A colonoscopy sounds… scary, but I guess if we have to. Is the blood test a lot? And what exactly will the stool sample be looking for? Sorry, I'm just asking a lot of questions. I just don't like not knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Jase – it's good to be informed, and I want you to feel comfortable. The blood test is just a standard vial or two – nothing too excessive. It will help us look at your overall health, inflammation levels, and screen for celiac disease. The stool sample will be looking for bacteria, parasites, and signs of inflammation in your digestive tract. It will also help rule out any infection. I’m going to print out some instructions for collecting the stool sample, and a lab requisition for the blood test. We can schedule the blood draw at the lab across the street, and you can drop off the stool sample anytime. While we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and eating bland foods – things like rice, toast, and bananas. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Rice, toast, and bananas, I can do that. Plenty of fluids too. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing what's going on, and that we have a plan. Hopefully, it's not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. And I’m optimistic we'll get to the bottom of this. It's important to remember we're just gathering information right now. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You've been really helpful. And… patient with all my questions. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll see you when the results are back. Take care, and try to rest. Have a good day.
