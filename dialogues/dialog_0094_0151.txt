DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It's been going on for… oh, I don't know, a few weeks now, maybe longer. It's just annoying, really. I need to get this sorted, if we can, because I deliver the mail, and I need my hands for that!
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha, a few weeks of tingling in your hands and feet… and it’s interfering with your work delivering mail. That’s definitely something we need to look into. To get a better understanding, could you describe the tingling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn't go away completely. It comes and goes, mostly when I'm walking my route. Sometimes it's in my fingers, sometimes in my toes, sometimes both. It's hard to explain. Is that helpful? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Teretha. "Pins and needles," intermittent, worse with walking… that gives me a good starting point. Does anything relieve the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Sitting down helps a little, I suppose. But I can't sit down all day, can I? And sometimes shaking my hands makes it feel… less. But it always comes back. Honestly, I just try to ignore it. I'm not one to complain, you see. It's just… getting worse, that's why I came. It’s slowing me down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in before it significantly impacted your work. “Slowing you down” is a valid reason to seek medical attention. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… oh dear. That’s a good question. I think maybe? I’ve dropped a few things lately, more than usual. And my feet feel a little heavy sometimes at the end of my route. But I walk a lot, Doctor. It’s hard to tell if it’s just tiredness, you know? I’m 63, things don't work like they used to! I don’t know if that’s weakness, or just… old age.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Teretha. It can be difficult to distinguish normal age-related changes from something else. The dropping things and the heaviness are worth investigating, though. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color, particularly in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Skin color… hmm. No, not that I’ve seen. They’re a little pale, maybe? But I don’t spend much time in the sun, and I’m… well, I’m not exactly known for my tan! No changes in color, no rashes, nothing like that. Just the tingling, and the dropping things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you experienced any other symptoms like balance problems, difficulty walking, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, no vision changes, thank goodness. My balance… well, I am a little unsteady sometimes, but that’s probably just my age again. I get a little dizzy if I stand up too fast, but nothing major. And no real trouble walking, just… slower. It's everything is slower now, Doctor! I'm really just here about the tingling. Honestly, I don’t want to bother you with all my old lady problems.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Teretha. It’s important to get a complete picture, and you're helping me do that. And these aren’t necessarily “old lady problems,” they’re things we need to rule out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… high blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago, but it's been pretty well controlled with medication. Otherwise, no. No diabetes, no arthritis. Just the high blood pressure. And… my husband, God rest his soul, he had some heart trouble, but that was him, not me. I try to eat healthy, I really do. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Teretha. High blood pressure is important. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other medications at all?
PATIENT: Yes, for my blood pressure. I take… let me see… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And that's it. Just the Lisinopril. I’ve been taking it for years. And I try to remember to take it every morning, but sometimes I forget… I’m not the best at remembering things these days. I really do try though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And you said occasionally you forget a dose. That's alright, we can discuss that later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully. My mother always said I had an iron stomach! No allergies, no. Just the tingling. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And finally, have you had any recent injuries, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. I broke my wrist a few years ago, when I fell on the ice, but that healed up fine. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the broken wrist, a long time ago. I'm usually pretty careful, you see. So, what do you think is causing the tingling? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. Thank you for all that information. It’s very helpful. Based on what you've told me – the tingling in your hands and feet, worsening with walking, occasional weakness, high blood pressure controlled with Lisinopril, and no known allergies or recent injuries – several things could be contributing to your symptoms. Peripheral neuropathy is a possibility, which is nerve damage often caused by diabetes or other medical conditions, but given your lack of diabetes history, other causes need to be considered. Vascular issues, or problems with blood flow, could also be playing a role. And sometimes medication side effects can cause similar symptoms. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Check everything you need to. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, get it fixed. I can’t afford to be off work for long. The mail has to get delivered, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teretha. We'll figure this out together. Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I always thought my legs were a little shaky, but maybe that's just old age. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little diminished reflexes on both sides, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I used to be much stronger, you know. Delivering mail is hard work. Is that strong enough?
DOCTOR: A little bit of weakness in both hands, particularly with resisting movement. Now, I'm going to check sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton swab and ask you to tell me if you can feel it. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright, I can close my eyes. It's hard to explain, sometimes I feel it, sometimes I don't. It's like… a tingling feeling, mostly. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced sensation in both hands and feet, particularly in the fingertips and toes. I also notice some coolness to the touch in your feet. Based on the physical exam, the reduced reflexes, some weakness, reduced sensation, and coolness in your feet, I'm concerned about possible peripheral artery disease, or PAD. This is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet become narrowed, reducing blood flow. To confirm this, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. We'll need a blood test to check your blood sugar, kidney function, and vitamin levels. And I’d like you to have an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, which measures the blood pressure in your arms and ankles to assess blood flow. And potentially, a vascular ultrasound, if the ABI is abnormal. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Vascular… that sounds serious. Tests… yes, alright, if that's what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. What does this mean? Will I need… surgery? I can’t afford to be off work for long, and I definitely can't afford surgery. I just deliver the mail, Doctor. It's not a very important job.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Teretha. Let’s take this one step at a time. PAD can be serious if left untreated, but it's often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. Surgery is sometimes necessary, but it's not always the first step. We'll start with the tests to get a clear picture of what’s going on before we discuss any treatment options. The blood test is straightforward – just a simple blood draw. And the ABI is a non-invasive test – we simply measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions. The tests will help us determine the extent of the problem, and then we can discuss the best course of action. It may be as simple as starting a walking program, taking medication to improve blood flow, or making dietary changes. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and ABI. The lab and imaging center will schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral process?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. A walking program… I suppose I can manage that. And medication… alright. As long as it doesn’t make me too tired. It's just… I worry about slowing down. The route is long, and the bags are heavy. But alright. Walking program and medication. I'll try. Will this affect my blood pressure medication at all? Should I still take that like normal?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Teretha. Yes, please continue to take your Lisinopril as prescribed for your blood pressure. We don't want to make any changes to that without knowing the results of the tests. If the tests confirm PAD, we may need to adjust your medications down the line, but we'll discuss that if and when the time comes. I'm also going to recommend that you stop smoking, if you smoke. Smoking significantly worsens PAD. And I encourage you to wear comfortable, supportive shoes when you’re delivering mail. Here’s the referral. The lab and imaging center are located at [address and phone number]. They’ll schedule the appointments for you. Once you have the results, please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them and create a plan together. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to get back to work, delivering the mail. It's important, you know. People rely on us. I’ll call and schedule the appointments right away. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I understand how important your work is. And I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll figure this out together. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
