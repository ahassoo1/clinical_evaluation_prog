DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just… tired. Really tired. And I… eat dirt. Okay? Is that enough for you? It's stupid. I just… feel like I need it sometimes. Don't ask me why.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Tired,” you say. And you’ve been… consuming dirt?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Whatever you call it. It’s not like I want to, you know? It just… happens. And it doesn’t help the tiredness, obviously. It feels bad afterwards. But then… I need more. It's a whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds… distressing. And you say this has been happening for a while?
PATIENT: A while… Look, things kinda blur together. My husband… he passed a few years back. It was… rough. Maybe it started then? Honestly, I don’t remember specifics. I just know it keeps getting worse. And I'm exhausted. Can we just figure out what's wrong and get me fixed?
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll do our best. Just trying to get a clear picture of everything. You mentioned it started around the time of your husband’s passing. That’s important information. Besides the fatigue and the… dirt consumption, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? I'm old. Things are always changing. My knees hurt more, I forget where I put things… Is that what you want to know? I don’t know! Just… tired. And the dirt. Seriously, focus on the dirt. It's the weird part, right? Everything else is just… old lady stuff.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, it is unusual. And we will address it. But it’s important to understand the whole picture. When you say “tired,” is it just feeling sleepy, or is it more like a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, perhaps even feeling weak?
PATIENT: Weak, yeah. Definitely weak. Like… lifting groceries is a struggle. I used to be able to carry everything in one trip. Now? Forget it. I need help. And it’s not just physical. My brain… it feels foggy. Like trying to see through mud. Sometimes I can’t even remember what I was saying mid-sentence. Ugh.
DOCTOR: Okay. Physical weakness and cognitive difficulties. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember. Sometimes I don’t feel hungry. Other times I just… don’t bother. It's all kinda… meh. I do get these… cravings sometimes. Not for food, exactly. More like… a need for something. And then I find myself eating dirt. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that certainly counts. And it’s important information. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I climb the stairs, mostly. I just chalked it up to being out of shape. I haven't been walking much lately, too tired. Dizzy… occasionally, yeah. Like when I stand up too fast. Old people problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. And if it involves poking me a lot, you better be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And finally, I'll do a quick neurological assessment. It won't take long. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Pulse is 80 and regular. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me… Lungs sound a little quiet, but otherwise normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up. My heart… probably just old. Beep boop, you know? Like a rusty machine.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal rhythm, but I did detect a slight murmur. I'll want to investigate that further. And your reflexes and coordination seem good. Now, I'm going to check your iron levels and a complete blood count. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any trouble with anything. Although… I did react to some lotion once, years ago. Made my skin all itchy. But that was ages ago. Latex… I don’t think so. I’m not one for balloons or anything. Just get the tests done. And can I go now after? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known latex allergy. We'll proceed with the blood tests. My nurse will be in shortly to draw them. It shouldn't take long. And yes, after the blood tests, you’ll be free to go. We will get to the bottom of this, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll check for iron deficiency, and we'll also look into the cause of your fatigue and the…dirt consumption. It’s important that we rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't keep me waiting. And if I start craving dirt while I'm here, don't look at me funny. It’s embarrassing enough as it is. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Of course not. I understand. We’ll do our best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll let the nurse know to come in right away. Please just sit here and relax. .
PATIENT: .
