DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Withycombe, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Enrique Withycombe. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it? You look very busy today.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is a busy clinic. Let’s not dwell on that. I’m Dr. Sink. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry. I keep forgetting things these days. It’s this… flushing. My face gets very red, very quickly. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It’s not painful, just… warm, and red. And people stare.
DOCTOR: Flushing, you say. A month, approximately. And it’s… socially concerning, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Socially concerning. It’s embarrassing. I used to not worry about things like that, but… well. It’s just not nice when people look at you like something is wrong. It makes me feel… shy, you know? I don’t like feeling shy.
DOCTOR: Right. Any other symptoms accompanying this… flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little fast when it happens. Not like a racing heart, just… noticeable. And I get a little sweaty, mostly my palms. But that could just be the weather, it's been very hot, no? I drink a lot of water, though.
DOCTOR: Hot flashes, essentially. And you're sure it's not related to exertion?
PATIENT: Exertion? Like… working hard? No, not really. It happens when I’m just… sitting. Or talking. Like now, actually. A little bit now, maybe? It’s not bad, just… there. It’s hard to explain. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me see… Nothing regularly, Doctor. Not anymore. I used to take something for… well, a long time ago, for my nerves. But I stopped that years and years ago. Now, just a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. But I haven't taken it in months, maybe. I don't really keep track. Do you need to know the name of the old one? It was… a long name. I don’t remember it.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve had all sorts of things over the years, and never a reaction. Mostly just… aches and pains, old age things. Nothing serious. You know, the usual. I’m a pretty sturdy guy, normally. This flushing is just… new. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. And I don't have much family left. I came from India a long time ago, and we didn’t keep in close touch. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, maybe. But that was a very long time ago. I don’t really know much about it. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Sorry. I’m not very good with details like that.
DOCTOR: Right. And your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? What do you mean? Like… do I go to parties? No, not really. Not since my wife… But I like to walk in the park. And I volunteer at the community center a few days a week. I mostly just help with… sorting things. And talking to people. I don’t drink or smoke, if that’s what you mean. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and rice. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse… and just a general look. If you’ll just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I don’t like needles, if that’s what you’re thinking. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. I do notice some mild facial erythema, but it's not currently pronounced. It's difficult to assess without observing a full episode.
PATIENT: Erythema? Is that… the redness? Yes, it comes and goes. It’s very unpredictable. Like you said, hard to catch. Sometimes I see it in the mirror, and other times people just… tell me. It's very strange. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It could be rosacea, or another skin condition. It could also be related to blood pressure fluctuations, or even anxiety, given your history. We need to rule things out. I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I’ll give you a form for that.
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, okay. That sounds… thorough. And monitor my blood pressure? I don’t have one of those machines. Do I need to buy one? And what about the form? Where do I… write down the numbers? I’m not very good with technology, Doctor. I still have a flip phone.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to purchase a blood pressure monitor. Any pharmacy will have them. They're readily available. The form is simple, I’ll print it out for you. You just write down the numbers—systolic over diastolic—twice a day, morning and evening. We’ll discuss the results next week. If the flushing becomes severe, or you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Right. A blood pressure machine… and write down the numbers. Morning and evening. Systolic over diastolic… This looks… complicated. And the emergency room… that sounds frightening. But okay, I will try. I will buy the machine, and I will write down the numbers. And if it gets very bad, I will go to the emergency room. Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine. Try to manage stress. And get adequate sleep. We'll review the blood work and your blood pressure logs next week. If anything changes significantly before then, call the office. Here's the follow-up appointment card. I have other patients waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Right. No alcohol, manage stress, get sleep… and the blood pressure logs. Yes, thank you, Doctor. I will try my best. Goodbye… and thank you again. .
