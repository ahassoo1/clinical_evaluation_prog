DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Pehrson. I am here because of my ear. It… it is leaking something. Not much, but it is there. It started maybe three days ago, I think. August… the first, perhaps? I keep a calendar.
DOCTOR: Leaking, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, leaking. A fluid. Clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow, I believe. It does not hurt, Doctor. Not really. Just… bothersome. It makes a small noise when I move my head. Like a… a tiny bubble popping.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, no pain, just discharge and… bubbles. You said it started around the first of August?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. August first. Or perhaps the second. I am quite certain it was not before. I remember checking the date when I first noticed it. It is my left ear, Doctor. The left one. I have noticed no changes in my hearing, if that is important.
DOCTOR: No changes in hearing... okay. And have you had any fever, any dizziness, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I check my temperature every morning, and it has been normal. No dizziness. I walk… I walk straight. And my balance is… is good. I have not fallen. I drink my tea carefully, you know. Do not spill.
DOCTOR: Right. And…any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question, Doctor. I believe… when I was a young man, in Somalia, I had an earache. A very bad one. But I do not remember if it was an infection. We did not have doctors like you then. A traditional healer… he used warm oil. It helped, eventually. But I have not had problems with my ears since. For many, many years.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Only my tea, Doctor. And a small vitamin pill each morning. Vitamin D, the bottle says. My daughter… she worries about my bones. I do not have any other medicines. No pills for blood pressure, or sugar, or anything like that. Just the tea and the vitamin. I drink chamomile, mostly. It helps me sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your ear then. Just lean back and try to stay still. I'm going to use an otoscope.
PATIENT: An otoscope? What does it do, Doctor? Is it… is it uncomfortable? I will try to be very still. But I do not like things in my ears. It makes me nervous. Is it cold?
DOCTOR: It's just a light, Mr. Radillo. It lets me see inside your ear. It's not cold, and it shouldn't hurt. Just… hold still. Hmm. There’s some fluid in there, as you said. And the ear canal looks a little inflamed. No visible perforation, thankfully.
PATIENT: Inflamed? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? The fluid… is it an infection, you think? It is not causing much trouble, but I do not want it to get worse. I have a trip planned, you see. To visit my daughter. In Minneapolis. It is in two weeks. I must be well for that.
DOCTOR: It's probably just a mild outer ear infection – otitis externa. Not a big deal, usually. But we need to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order a culture to see what's growing in there. And I’ll write you a prescription for some antibiotic ear drops.
PATIENT: Antibiotic… ear drops? Will they… will they sting? And the culture… does that involve taking something from my ear? I do not like things taken from my ear, Doctor. It makes me very uncomfortable. And how long will it take to get the results of this… culture? Will it interfere with my trip? Minneapolis is a long flight.
DOCTOR: The drops might sting a little at first, but it shouldn’t be bad. And yes, the culture involves a small swab – just a quick wipe inside your ear. It won’t take long. As for the results… it usually takes a couple of days. It shouldn’t interfere with your trip. Just follow the instructions with the ear drops and we’ll see what the culture says when you get back. Here. Take this to the pharmacy and to the lab. Finish the entire course of drops, even if it feels better. And if it gets worse – significant pain, fever, drainage, hearing loss – go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. The entire course of drops… even if it feels better. And the emergency room for… significant pain, fever, drainage, and loss of hearing. I will write that down. Minneapolis… two weeks. I hope this does not ruin my visit. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. What is the cost of the culture? And do you have the name of a good pharmacy nearby? One that is… clean?
DOCTOR: The culture will be covered by your insurance. As for a pharmacy… there's a Walgreens about a mile down the road. It’s… fine. Look, I have other patients waiting. Just take these orders and follow the instructions. If you have any more questions, call the office. Next!
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I will go to the Walgreens. And I will call if… if something happens. I hope you have a good day, Doctor Pehrson.
