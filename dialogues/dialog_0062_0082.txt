DOCTOR: Hi Odell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, nice to meet you too. I... need to go somewhere. For work. It's... far away. Someone said I need to… check things before I go. Like, make sure I don't get sick. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need a general check-up before starting a new job that might take you far from medical care. That’s a really smart idea to get things sorted out beforehand. To help me get a better picture of what we need to do, could you tell me a little more about the work itself?
PATIENT: Work? It's… with planes. Building them, fixing them. I put… parts together. Lots of little parts. It's... okay. Pay is good. I don't really tell people what I do though. It's… complicated. Why does it matter?
DOCTOR: It matters because some jobs have specific health risks we need to consider. For example, working with planes might involve exposure to certain chemicals, loud noises, or require a lot of physical exertion. Knowing these things helps me tailor the check-up to make sure you're fit for the job and to discuss any potential preventative measures. But don't worry, we'll just go through some routine questions and a physical exam. First, let’s talk about your general health. Have you been feeling well lately?
PATIENT: Well enough. I mean, I get tired, but... everyone gets tired, right? My wife… she always said I didn’t rest enough. But she’s… gone now. So it doesn't matter so much. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I cough. Just a little cough. Nothing big. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Odell. It's completely understandable that you're still processing that loss. It’s okay to take your time. And yes, knowing about things like fatigue and cough is important. You mentioned fatigue and a cough. How long have you been feeling tired, and how would you describe the cough?
PATIENT: A long time. Since… well, since everything. The cough... it comes and goes. Mostly when it's cold. Not a bad cough, like, I don't cough up anything. Just a tickle. I don’t know. It’s probably nothing. People cough all the time. You think I'm wasting your time?
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Odell. It's good you're being thorough, even if you think it's nothing. It's my job to listen and help figure things out. Since it’s been going on for a while, and you mentioned it sometimes happens when it's cold, let's just do a quick review of your medical history to get a better picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like asthma, allergies, or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Is that… like a bad cough? I don't think so. I've never been told anything. I get sick sometimes, like a normal cold. My wife… she always took care of things. She knew all that stuff. Doctors and… medicines. I just tried not to bother her too much. She worked so hard. I don’t know about… asthma. I can breathe okay, I think. Do you think I should be worried?
DOCTOR: It sounds like your wife was a wonderful caregiver, and I understand how difficult it is to navigate things without her. Don't worry, we’ll figure things out together. Okay, no known asthma or bronchitis. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm when I was little, climbing a tree. But my dad fixed it. He… he knew a lot about bones. It healed fine. No hospitals. I don't like hospitals. Too many… people. And smells. Everything just feels… wrong. Is this taking too long? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: No, it's not taking too long at all. It’s important to get a complete picture, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It sounds like you’ve been resourceful your whole life. Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems? My grandfather… he smoked a lot. All the time. He always smelled like… burning leaves. He got… sick. Very sick. He couldn't breathe. He just… got weaker and weaker. My mom said it was his lungs. But that was a long time ago. Everyone on my mom's side is pretty healthy, I think. She always ate lots of vegetables. I don’t remember much else. Why do you keep asking about sick people? This is making me… sad.
DOCTOR: I apologize for bringing up difficult memories, Odell. It sounds like your grandfather’s illness was very hard on your family. I ask about family history because certain conditions can run in families, and it helps me understand your potential risks. It’s okay to feel sad – it’s natural to grieve and remember loved ones. We can move on to another topic if you'd like. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No! Never. I hate smoking. It smelled awful on my grandfather. And it made him… weak. My wife hated it too. She said it was bad for your heart. I don't even go near people who are smoking. It’s… disgusting. Just thinking about it makes me cough a little, actually. Just a tickle. Like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Odell. It's wonderful that you've never smoked. Now, do you drink alcohol or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't like how it smells, and I don't like how it makes people act. My wife… she would get very angry if people drank too much. She said it ruined families. I just… stick to water. And sometimes tea. That's all. Is this almost over? I'm starting to feel… strange. Like I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol or substance use. It sounds like you prioritize a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. You mentioned feeling strange and like you need to sit down. Can you describe what you're feeling?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. Just a little… dizzy. And my chest feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing it. Not a big squeeze, just… a little one. I don’t know. Maybe it’s the air in here? It smells funny. Like… chemicals. I need some water. Please? I think… I think I’m getting hot. Is this what happens when you’re sick?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell, I'm going to ask the nurse to bring you some water right away. It sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms that need to be checked out more closely. The tightness in your chest and the dizziness are concerning, especially given your grandfather’s history. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and I may need to order some tests to rule out anything serious. It’s better to be safe, okay?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. I don’t like hospitals. I just wanted to make sure I didn't get sick on the plane. Is this going to take long? I have to… I have to go soon. My work… they’re expecting me. They need me. And… and my wife would be so angry if I missed my start date. She planned everything. Everything. .
DOCTOR: Odell, please try to stay calm. We’re going to take things one step at a time. I want to get you feeling better, and we will. I’m going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. We may also need to do a blood test. These tests will help us understand what's causing your symptoms. “Please bring me the oxygen saturation monitor and have the emergency cart ready, just in case.” "We’re right here, Odell. I’m going to get the nurse to start the oxygen monitor, and then we can discuss the next steps."
