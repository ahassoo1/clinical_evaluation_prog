DOCTOR: Hi Aldine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you too. My head’s been botherin’ me, right at the back. An’ it ain’t just a little bother, ya know? It’s a proper headache. Been goin’ on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for a few days. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure, I can. It's... well, it feels like a tight band squeezin’ around my head, mostly at the very back. Not a throbbing pain, more like a constant pressure. And it seems to get worse when I’m tryin’ to concentrate, like when I’m doin’ someone’s nails – gotta be real precise, ya know? It don't really stop me from workin’, but it makes it harder, definitely. I been takin’ some paracetamol, helps a little, but it comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tight, band-like pressure at the back of your head, worse with concentration, and partially relieved by paracetamol. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, nothin’ specific. Layin’ down doesn’t make a huge difference, and it don’t seem to matter what I’m eatin’ or drinkin’. Bright lights don't bother it, and neither does loud noise. I did notice it was a bit worse yesterday after spendin' a long time bent over doin’ a pedicure, but I always bend over a lot with my work, so I don't know if that's connected. My wife, Miriam, she says I been lookin’ a bit stressed lately, but I always keep busy, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers other than potentially prolonged bending, and your wife has noticed you seem stressed. Has anything particularly stressful been happening lately?
PATIENT: Well, now that Miriam mentioned it… the shop’s been a bit busier than usual, people preparin’ for vacations and such. An’ old Mr. Henderson, one of my regular customers, he's been complainin’ somethin’ fierce about the price of everything lately. Nothin’ major, mind you, but it adds up, ya know? An’ I’m tryin’ to help my daughter, Delphine, with a down payment on a house – she's a lovely girl, workin’ real hard, but things are expensive these days. So, yes, I suppose I have been a bit preoccupied. Still, I don’t usually let things get to me.
DOCTOR: I see. So some increased stress from work and family finances. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been lucky, touch wood. I had a bit of high blood pressure years ago, but it's been under control for ages, ever since I started watchin' my salt intake. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, ya know? I walk a fair bit, keep myself active. No allergies, no asthma, nothin' like that. Miriam worries about me sometimes, but I feel alright, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And the high blood pressure is controlled, that’s excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Not a hospital stay, not a surgery. Had all my vaccinations when I was a boy, of course, and got a flu shot every year, Miriam insists on it. But that’s about it. I've always been careful, try to eat right, get enough sleep. I reckon that's helped keep me goin’ this long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no hospitalizations, and up-to-date on vaccinations. And you mentioned you walk a fair bit – about how much walking do you typically do in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I walk to the shop every day, that’s about a mile each way. An’ I take a longer walk on Sundays, usually with Miriam, down by the river. Maybe another two, three miles then? So, I reckon, on average, maybe five or six miles a week. Not a marathon runner, mind you, but I keep movin’. I find it helps clear my head, even when I’m feelin’ a bit stressed.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s a good level of activity. Now, just to finish up with your history, are you currently taking any medications, other than the paracetamol for your headaches?
PATIENT: Just the paracetamol when the headache gets bad, Doctor. That's it. No pills for blood pressure, no vitamins, no nothin'. Miriam keeps offerin' me some sort of herbal remedy she read about online, but I tell her I'm doin' just fine. She means well, bless her heart, but I'm a simple man, I prefer to keep things straightforward.
DOCTOR: Alright, just paracetamol as needed. And no known allergies. Okay, Aldine, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam – just to make sure everything is working as it should. And I'll take your blood pressure, just to confirm it’s still well-controlled. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – that’s a little elevated, but not significantly. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and I'll check your strength and sensation in your arms and legs. Everything seems to be working well here. Finally, I'm going to palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness. There's some mild tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck, which is likely related to your headache. Overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable. Your neurological function is intact, and there are no other obvious signs of concern.
PATIENT: Hmm, that's good to hear, Doctor. It does feel a bit tight there, as you said. I often carry a bit of tension in my shoulders and neck, I suppose. Miriam always tells me to relax more! So, what do you think is causin' this headache? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be something serious, Aldine. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds most likely to be a tension headache. These are very common, often triggered by stress, muscle tension, and fatigue. The tenderness in your neck muscles supports that diagnosis. The mild elevation in blood pressure could be contributing, but it’s not drastically high. To rule out other possibilities, and because you are 87, I would like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. These are just routine tests to be on the safe side. I’d also like to check your thyroid stimulating hormone as thyroid issues can sometimes cause headaches.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Routine tests, you say? I don’t mind that at all, if it puts my mind at ease. Miriam will be pleased you’re bein’ thorough. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Great. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will draw a small amount of blood. It will only take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically come back within 2-3 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take paracetamol as needed for the headache. Try to incorporate some relaxation techniques into your daily routine – deep breathing exercises, gentle stretching, or even just spending some quiet time doing something you enjoy. And continue to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a cuff. If the headache gets significantly worse, doesn't respond to paracetamol, or is accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Right, that's very clear, Doctor. Room 203, paracetamol, relaxation, and watch out for anythin’ worse. I think I’ve got it. Actually, yes, I do have one question. My wife, Miriam, she’s always talkin’ about supplements, this one and that one. Would any of those be helpful for headaches like this? I'm a bit skeptical, to be honest, but she's very insistent.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. While some supplements are marketed for headaches, there’s limited high-quality evidence to support their use, and they can sometimes interact with other medications. Magnesium and riboflavin have shown some promise in preventing migraines, but tension headaches are different. Coenzyme Q10 is another one that's been studied, but again, the evidence isn't conclusive. I generally recommend focusing on a healthy diet, adequate hydration, and stress management as the first steps. If you're considering any supplements, it's best to discuss them with me first to make sure they're safe and won't interfere with any other health conditions or medications you're taking. In your case, I wouldn't recommend starting any supplements at this time. Let's see what the blood tests show, and then we can reassess. Do you have any other questions for me today, Aldine?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very helpful and put my mind at ease. I'll go and get these blood tests done, and then we'll see what happens. Thank you for your time. .
