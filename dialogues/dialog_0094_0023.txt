DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a bad pain, more… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” is a good way to start. Can you tell me a little more about that discomfort?
PATIENT: It's... hard to say exactly where. It feels like… all over, but maybe more on this side. Not always there, like I said. Sometimes it feels… full? And… sore, a little. Like after exercise, but I didn't do exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mostly on the left side, a feeling of fullness and soreness, even without exertion. And it comes and goes. How long has this been happening, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe... two, three weeks now? I don't really keep track of days so good. It started slow, just a little bit. Now it's… more noticeable, I guess. My wife, she told me I should come see you. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That's good of your wife to encourage you to come in. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: No... not that I know of. I work on roofs, so it's always… moving around. Sometimes hot, sometimes cold. I don't think that makes it worse. Sleeping doesn't change it. Nothing I can think of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No… coughing. Nothing like that. Just the… the feeling in my chest. I feel okay, otherwise. Tired, maybe. But I always feel a little tired from the work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest wall. Just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up there for me, please. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I might also feel around your chest, just to check for any tenderness. It will be quick. Your heart sounds regular, rate is about 72. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. There's a little tenderness when I press right here , but nothing significant. It doesn't seem to be a muscle strain, but it's hard to say for sure without further investigation. Is there any pain when I ask you to take a deep breath?
PATIENT: Yeah... a little. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a pulling feeling. It's not too bad, though. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like hurting, more like… I don’t know. Annoying.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is a perfectly good way to describe it, Mr. Bulaong. Okay. Given your description, and the physical exam, it could be a few things. It could be musculoskeletal - something with the muscles or cartilage in your chest wall. But because of the discomfort you’re describing, and the fact that it’s not going away, I’d like to be cautious. I want to order an EKG – that’s a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart – and a chest X-ray just to rule out anything more serious. Would you be able to do those today?
PATIENT: EKG and... X-ray? Yeah, I can do that. Whatever you need, Doctor. I don't really understand what those are for, but if you think it's best… Will it… hurt? And how long will it take? I need to get back to work… eventually.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Mr. Bulaong. We just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart’s rhythm. It takes about five minutes. The X-ray is also painless. You'll stand in front of a machine, and it takes a picture of your lungs and heart. It takes just a few seconds. The technician will explain everything, but they are both quick and straightforward. I want to rule out anything like inflammation around the heart, or issues with your lungs. It's just a precaution. Given your insurance status, the clinic does have some assistance programs available for testing. Let's see what we can do to make it affordable. I'll have the nurse talk to you about that after we get the orders in. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that… sounds okay. No pain is good. And if it's quick, that's even better. I don’t have insurance, so… help with the cost would be good. Really good. I just want to get back to work. My wife… she worries when I’m not working.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bulaong. We’ll do our best to get you sorted out quickly and affordably. Let me get the orders for the EKG and chest X-ray entered, and then I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the process and discuss the financial assistance options with you. Alright, the orders are in. I’ll have Nurse Ramirez come in now to get you set up. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not laughing at me for not knowing what's going on. And for helping with the cost. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to thank me, Mr. Bulaong. That’s what I’m here for. It’s perfectly normal to not understand medical things, and I'm happy to explain everything as clearly as I can. We’ll figure this out together. Nurse Ramirez will be right in. She’s excellent, and will take good care of you. Just let me know if you have any questions or concerns at all, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Doctor.
