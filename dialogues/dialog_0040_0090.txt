DOCTOR: Right, so… what brings you in today, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, Doctor Osga, it’s about a surgery I’m… considering. I believe my paperwork mentioned it’s a pre-clearance visit? It's all a bit… fuzzy, truthfully. I’m Mackenzi Brightful, by the way. It’s nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Brightful, Brightful… yes, yes. Pre-op for… elective abdominal surgery, according to this. Look, I have a lot of patients, so if you could just get straight to the point about why you’re even thinking about this surgery, that would be great. Fuzzy is… not helpful. Is it weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… apologize. It is a bit difficult to recall precisely. It wasn’t… a decision made lightly, certainly. My husband… he would have wanted me to… feel better about myself. It’s not just about weight loss, no. It’s… more about tightening things up, I suppose. After… everything. And he always said I deserved to feel beautiful. Is that… a reasonable explanation? I’m sorry if it’s not very clear. My memory hasn’t been the same since… well.
DOCTOR: Right. “Tightening things up.” Look, Ms. Brightful, I need specifics. Vague feelings aren’t going to get you cleared for surgery. What specifically are you unhappy with?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… well, it’s… my stomach, mostly. It feels… stretched, and loose. After having Mateo, it never really… went back. And then… with everything else, I haven’t really taken care of myself. It just… bothers me. It feels… wrong. I suppose I just want it to feel firmer, more… like it used to. Is that… specific enough? I’m really not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Stretched and loose." Right. And how long has this been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. Since Mateo was born, definitely. He’s… eight years old now. But it’s been worse… the last few years, I think. After… after my husband passed. I just… didn’t have the energy, or the will, to… take care of myself. So, probably about five years, at least, of it really bothering me. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Eight years post-partum, worsened over five… Okay. Any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No, not that I recall. I had Mateo via Cesarean, of course, but that’s it. Nothing elective, nothing… cosmetic before this. I’ve had the usual things, you know, wisdom teeth out when I was younger, and a broken arm once, but that was a long time ago. Nothing like… this. I’m fairly certain, anyway. My memory is just… Is there a way to check, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Nothing listed here. Alright. Any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, the doctor said I had a little bit of high blood pressure last year, but it’s been controlled with medication since then. And… I have seasonal allergies, terribly bad in the spring. Other than that… I think I’m fairly healthy. Relatively, at least. I try to eat well, when I can, and I walk Mateo to school when the weather permits. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Medication for blood pressure… what medication specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we are. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… I take a Claritin in the spring, for the allergies. That’s all. I think. I really do try to keep track, but… things get lost, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Allergies, Lisinopril. Okay. Now, let’s talk about family history. Anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… um… my mother had some problems with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was fairly young, so I don't remember the details. My father was healthy as a horse, right up until the end. He didn’t have any… significant illnesses, as far as I know. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had diabetes, I believe. That’s… all I can really recall, truthfully. It was a long time ago, and… my family isn’t very forthcoming with medical details, usually. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let's move on. Any smoking or alcohol use?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps, but that’s it. My husband… he didn’t approve. And… I just don’t enjoy it, really. I find it makes me feel… unwell. So, no, I don’t smoke or drink, not regularly. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Just standard stuff. Lie back on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Don’t worry, it won’t take long. Hmm. Abdomen is… soft, some laxity, as you mentioned. No obvious masses. Blood pressure is… elevated, 140/90. Still. We'll need to monitor that. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Elevated, you say? That's… not good, is it? I thought the Lisinopril was supposed to be controlling it. I do try to… manage my stress, but… it’s difficult, sometimes. Especially lately. I understand monitoring is good, of course. Is it… significantly elevated? Should I be concerned?
DOCTOR: It's… slightly elevated. We'll need to re-evaluate your medication dosage, possibly add another medication. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We need some blood work to get a clearer picture. A complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a CBC. Standard pre-op stuff. And honestly, just to rule things out given your history. I’ll order those for you now. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood work sounds… sensible. Yes, of course. Latex… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve had some reactions to certain perfumes in the past, a bit of a rash, but nothing serious. I’m not aware of any latex allergies. My husband always did the… medical things, so I haven’t really had to think about allergies much before. But no, I don’t believe so. Is that… sufficient? I’m really trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Look, Ms. Brightful, given your blood pressure and… vague history, I’m going to recommend postponing the surgery until we get these blood tests back and get your blood pressure under better control. It’s just… safer. And honestly, I think you should consider a consultation with a therapist. Grief can have a significant impact on your health. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for blood work and a follow-up appointment. And I'll send you a referral to a therapist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Postponing… Postponing… I understand it's safer, of course. But… I've been waiting for this for so long. And… the therapist… I… I suppose I could consider the therapist. But is postponing absolutely necessary? Could we… perhaps monitor things more closely, and proceed if everything looks stable? I just… I really want to feel like myself again. And I don't want to wait any longer than I have to. Is there… any way to expedite the tests?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, I understand you’re frustrated. But I am not going to take the risk of operating on someone with uncontrolled blood pressure. It’s irresponsible. The tests are standard. We will get them done as quickly as possible. And frankly, your emotional state is a significant factor. I strongly recommend you prioritize that. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If that’s what you recommend… then I suppose I have no choice. I’ll… schedule the tests and the follow-up appointment. And I’ll… consider the therapist. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate your… concern. .
