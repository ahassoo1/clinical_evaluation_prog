DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's… well, my hearing. It comes and goes, you see? And makes me feel so dizzy sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now, I think. My daughter, Lani, she was the one who really got me to come in. She worries something awful. I don’t always remember things clearly, so it’s hard to say when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Comes and goes, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s not constant. Sometimes I’ll wake up and everything sounds muffled, like there’s cotton in my ears. Then, usually within a few hours, it's back to normal. But then it'll happen again… maybe a day later, maybe a week. It’s just… unpredictable. And the dizziness… that’s usually with the hearing loss, but not always. It feels like the room is spinning, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, unpredictable hearing loss and dizziness. And how long do these episodes of dizziness last when they happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Sometimes just a few minutes, you know, like a wave passing over. Other times… longer. Maybe an hour or so? Once, I think it lasted most of the day. I had to lie down. It’s hard to say for sure, really. Everything feels a bit… blurry when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, ranging from minutes to hours. And is there anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I haven’t really noticed anything specific. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything I’m doing, or anywhere I’ve been. Maybe stress? I get a bit worried about things sometimes, especially since my husband passed. But I can’t say for sure if that’s it. Honestly, it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother… she had something similar, I think. She used to complain about her ears ringing and feeling unsteady. It was years ago, though. I don’t remember all the details, but I remember her seeing a doctor about it. I think they said something about… the inside of her ear? It wasn't the same as mine, exactly, but it rings a bell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of ear issues. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… sometimes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. It's not constant, like the hearing loss. Just comes and goes, a little like that. It’s usually when I’m quiet, I think. Hard to notice when there’s noise, you see? It doesn't bother me too much, but it’s there, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing as well. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with these episodes of dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not usually. Sometimes I feel a little bit sick to my stomach when I’m dizzy, but I’ve never actually been sick. Just… queasy, you know? It passes when the dizziness does, mostly. I haven’t had any trouble keeping anything down, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual things. For my blood pressure, a small white pill. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. Lani makes sure I take them, she’s very good like that. I think that’s all, yes. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get stung by bees when I was little, but I just got a bit of swelling, nothing serious. Lani always asks me, and I always tell her no. Never had any trouble with allergies, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart, check your ears, and maybe a quick balance test. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I’m not very good with medical things, you see. It all feels a bit strange. But I’m happy to help if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's start by taking a look in your ears. They look clear, no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Alright, everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to do a quick balance test. Could you stand up slowly and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Close my eyes… yes. Oh dear, I do feel a bit wobbly. It’s always worse when I close my eyes. My daughter always says I'm a bit clumsy.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little unsteady, as expected. Okay, please open your eyes now. Alright. You do seem a bit unsteady, especially with your eyes closed. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called Vestibular Neuritis. It's an inflammation of the inner ear, which can cause dizziness and hearing loss. It’s not usually serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Vestibular… neuritis? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. The inside of my ear, you said? It sounds a bit like what my mother had, maybe. It certainly explains the dizziness, and the feeling unsteady. Honestly, doctor, I just want to feel normal again. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can sound complicated, but we can manage it. Often it resolves on its own over a few weeks, but there are things we can do to help with the symptoms. I'm going to prescribe you some medication to help with the nausea, just in case. And I want you to start some Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy - that's a type of physical therapy to help improve your balance. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, medication for the nausea… that sounds good. I haven't been sick yet, but it's good to be prepared. And therapy? Physical therapy… to help my balance? Yes, I suppose so. If it can help me feel steady again, I’ll try anything. Lani would be very happy to hear that I’m doing something about it. She worries something awful, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll write you a prescription for Meclizine, take it as directed if you feel nauseous. And I'll give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in vestibular rehabilitation. They'll assess your balance and create a personalized exercise program for you. Now, it's also important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Avoid sudden movements and bright lights. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a high fever, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a lot to remember. Meclizine… rest… no sudden movements. Lani will help me keep track, I’m sure. And if things get worse, I should come back. Yes, that sounds right. Um… yes, I do have a question. Will this… neuritis… come back? Is it something I’ll have to live with forever? That’s what I’m really worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. In many cases, Vestibular Neuritis doesn’t recur. However, there is a chance it could come back, though it's not common. The vestibular rehabilitation therapy can help to strengthen your balance and reduce your risk of falls, even if it does recur. We can also discuss preventative measures, like avoiding triggers if we can identify them. We’ll monitor your progress and adjust the plan as needed. It's important to remember that even if symptoms return, there are things we can do to manage them. Does that help ease your mind a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, a little. Knowing there are things you can do… that’s good. Lani will be happy to hear that too. She’s always researching things online, trying to find the best ways to help. Um… I think that’s all my questions, for now. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It’s my job. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s the information on the medication and the referral again, just in case. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you for a follow-up in a few weeks to see how you’re progressing. Now, do you need a work/school note?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, I don’t work anymore. Retired years ago. Lani, she might need one for her work, though, to take me to the appointments. She's very considerate, that girl. But I don’t think so. No, thank you. I think… I think that’s everything. I’m ready to go now, if that’s alright. I’m a bit tired, all this talking.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright then. I'll have the nurse escort you out. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Terasa.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You too.
