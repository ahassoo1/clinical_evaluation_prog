DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin' me for… oh, goodness, maybe a week now? Not a terrible pain, but constant. Like a dull weight. It’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And you characterize it as a “dull weight.” Hmm. And has anything… changed recently that might be contributing to this “annoyance”?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not really, not that I can recall. Same routine, mostly. Wake up, little bit of tai chi, check the market numbers… sometimes visit my daughter, Lena, and the grandkids. Oh! Actually… I did help her move some furniture last Saturday. Big, heavy dresser. Maybe that? But it wasn't that heavy, I don’t think. I used to lift much more when I was younger, workin’ the fields. Still, could be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this headache… is it constant, as you said, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, Doctor. It’s there when I wake up, stays with me all day. It doesn't pulse, if that makes sense. Doesn’t feel like a throbbing, more… just is. Sometimes it’s a little worse when I’m lookin’ at the computer screen for too long, trackin’ investments. But even when I close my eyes, it’s still there, kinda… hangin’ on.
DOCTOR: Investment tracking, you say. Interesting. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No dizziness, no blurry vision. No nausea or anything like that. No fever, I don't think. I haven't really felt sick, just… tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But that’s usual. Oh! And sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, on the right side. Not bad, just… tight. Could be from sleepin’ funny.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with neurological assessment, then check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure, Mr. Gibbel. Don't anticipate a lengthy process.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. This old body isn't as nimble as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Please, lie supine. I need to assess your cranial nerves. Follow my finger with your eyes – do not move your head. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Here we go… followin' your finger. It’s a little bright, that light, but I’m followin’ it. Is this good? Am I doin’ it right?
DOCTOR: Adequate, adequate. Now, I need you to resist as I apply pressure. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Grip strength is… diminished. And shoulder abduction… limited range of motion. Tenderness to palpation on the right side of the posterior neck muscles. No obvious lymphadenopathy. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart rate regular, 78 beats per minute. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Oh, diminished, huh? Well, I haven't been liftin' much lately, like I said. Mostly just paperwork these days. And the shoulder... I think I slept on it wrong a few weeks back, but it didn't feel that bad. Is that somethin’ I should be worried about, Doctor? The shoulder, I mean.
DOCTOR: The shoulder is… likely a musculoskeletal issue, probably related to your inactivity and occasional improper sleeping posture. It does not present as an acute emergency. However, your headache, coupled with the neck tenderness and diminished grip strength… suggests possible tension headache, potentially exacerbated by muscle strain. I recommend over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen – as needed. And maintain proper posture. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with ibuprofen or naproxen. Good to know about the muscle strain, though. I do spend a lot of time hunched over the computer, lookin' at numbers. So, you think it’s just… tension? Not somethin’ serious? I was worryin' it might be somethin’ with my blood pressure, maybe. It’s been a little higher than usual lately.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, yes, but not to a level requiring immediate intervention. I strongly advise monitoring it regularly at home. And I recommend incorporating gentle stretching exercises into your daily routine. I believe this is a relatively straightforward case. Do not return unless your symptoms worsen significantly. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Gibbel. Take care. .
PATIENT: Well, alright then. Gentle stretchin’, monitor blood pressure… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor Blim. I appreciate you takin' the time. I hope it is just tension. .
