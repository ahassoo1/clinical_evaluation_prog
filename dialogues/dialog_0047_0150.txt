DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s be quick. I want to have a baby, and I want it to be… uncomplicated. I'm 51, not decrepit, and I'd like to skip the whole… struggle, if that’s possible. I’ve heard good things about your clinic, specifically regarding… efficient results.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “uncomplicated” is a rather broad term, Ms. Shteynberg. And while we strive for positive outcomes here, nature doesn't always cooperate with efficiency. Before we discuss any potential paths forward, I need a comprehensive understanding of your medical history. Let's start with the basics. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes, once. A long time ago. It… ended. Divorced husband, complicated story, not relevant. It was… normal, as far as pregnancies go. No complications during it, anyway. Frankly, I’d rather not rehash personal details. Is that enough? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your desire to be brief, Ms. Shteynberg, details are relevant. A prior pregnancy, even one considered “normal”, still provides valuable information. But we can move on for now. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I keep myself in excellent shape. I cycle, you know. It’s… demanding. Blood pressure is always good, cholesterol is fine, I eat a healthy diet… honestly, I’m probably healthier than half your patients. Is this a standard interrogation, or are we actually going to discuss options? Because I’m starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: It's a medical assessment, Ms. Shteynberg, not an interrogation. And a healthy lifestyle, while commendable, doesn't preclude underlying conditions. We need to be thorough. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh. Just a tonsillectomy when I was a child. And a… a rather unpleasant incident involving a bicycle and a curb a few years back, requiring some… stitching. Nothing major. Are we done with the childhood illnesses now? Because frankly, I’m finding this tedious. I came here for a solution, not a life story review.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother lived to 92. Father, 88. Both perfectly healthy, stubborn as mules, but healthy. No heart disease, no cancer, no… anything remarkable. Honestly, a very boring family history. Is this necessary? I assure you, I come from good stock.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Shteynberg. Even “boring” family histories can offer valuable clues. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I prefer to keep my body… pure. Vitamins, sometimes, when I feel a cold coming on. But no regular medication. I detest the idea of putting unnecessary chemicals into my system. Truly. This is starting to feel like you’re trying to find a reason not to help me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's review your EHR information then. Height 186 cm, weight 86 kg… good. Medicare insurance… correct. It notes a visit to a chiropractor six months ago for… lower back pain. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. A minor strain from… cycling, naturally. I don't see what that has to do with anything. It was a single visit, completely resolved. I needed a bit of alignment, that's all. Are you building a case against me here? I came to you for assistance, Doctor, and frankly, I'm beginning to regret wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I am gathering information, Ms. Shteynberg, to determine the best course of action for you. And a recent episode of back pain, however minor you deem it, is relevant. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I’m not… delicate. Dust bothers me a little, but that’s hardly an allergy. Look, are we going to discuss options for conception or continue this… exhaustive questionnaire? Because if you're going to treat me like a hypochondriac, I’ll simply go elsewhere. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss options. At your age, Ms. Shteynberg, natural conception is… less likely. We would likely need to consider assisted reproductive technologies, such as In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, using donor eggs. Your own egg quality at 51 is… diminished. Are you familiar with the process?
PATIENT: Donor eggs? Absolutely not. Are you suggesting I… use someone else's eggs? That's… barbaric. I want my child. That's why I'm here. I’ve heard about success with… I don’t know, some sort of hormonal treatment? Something to boost what I already have? I want to explore those options first. I refuse to even consider using a stranger’s genetic material. It’s… unthinkable.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hormonal treatment can be considered, but the success rates at your age are… significantly lower. We’re talking a very small chance, Ms. Shteynberg, and it would require extensive monitoring and carry a number of risks, including multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We would need to perform a comprehensive fertility workup first – blood tests to assess your hormone levels, an ultrasound to evaluate your ovaries and uterus, and potentially a hysteroscopy to examine the inside of your uterus. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But I want everything done quickly. I don’t have months to spend on endless tests. And I want a clear explanation of the risks, not some vague list of possibilities. If there's a minimal chance of success, tell me straight. I’m not afraid of the truth. Just… get on with it. And I expect a detailed timeline. My schedule is… demanding.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll order the necessary blood tests and schedule an ultrasound for next week. The results will take a few days to process. I’ll also schedule you for a consultation with the lab technician who will explain the procedure. In the meantime, I’ll have my nurse provide you with a detailed information packet outlining the potential risks and benefits of hormonal treatment. Is there anything else you would like to discuss at this time?
PATIENT: No. That will be all. Let’s just get the tests done, and I’ll expect a call with the results as soon as they are available. I have appointments, you know. Don't waste my time with unnecessary details or… sympathy. Just the facts. And the timeline. That's all. .
