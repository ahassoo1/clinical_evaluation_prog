DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Stilaire, is it? Hmm. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should just...get checked out. She worries too much. Said it’s been a while since I saw anyone. Just thought I’d see what all the fuss is about, I suppose. Don't remember having any specific reason, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It's very wise to have regular check-ups, even without a specific concern. It’s good of your daughter to encourage that. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you perhaps tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Oh, goodness. Well, I get tired, of course. Don't we all, at my age? And my knees… they ache something fierce when it rains. Though, they ache even without the rain, if I'm being honest. I mostly just take things easy these days. Used to be quite the go-getter, you know. Surgical tech for… oh, I don’t even remember how long. A long time. But now? Easy is good. Is that what you want to know? Just…old lady stuff, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. It’s not “old lady stuff” at all; it’s important information. The fatigue and knee pain are certainly things we should explore. When did you first notice the fatigue, and has it been getting progressively worse, or is it more consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Progressively… that’s a big word. Let me think. It's… been a while. Probably started… after Harold passed. He did all the heavy lifting, you know? Both literally and figuratively. I just sort of… slowed down after that. It's hard to say if it’s worse now, or if I just haven't had the energy to notice if it’s worse. Does that make sense? Everything just feels… a bit muted, if you know what I mean. I mostly just nap a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. Grief can have a significant impact on energy levels and overall well-being. It sounds like this fatigue has been present for some time, coinciding with your loss. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… Well, I wake up… eventually. Usually around 8, maybe 9. Watch a little television. The news is dreadful these days, so I mostly watch those home renovation shows. I eat breakfast… usually toast. Sometimes cereal. Then I potter around the house. Dust a bit, maybe. Sometimes I’ll call my daughter, but she’s always busy. Lunch is usually a sandwich. Then another nap. Dinner is… whatever I feel like. Or whatever my daughter brings over. And then more television until bedtime. Exciting, isn’t it? It’s a very… quiet life. Is that helpful? I don't do much, really.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've established a comfortable routine. Now, regarding your knee pain, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees. Don’t even get me started. It’s just… achey. All the time, really. But it gets worse when I walk a lot. Or when it’s cold. Like I said, rain makes it terrible. It’s not… sharp pain, just a dull throb. Makes getting up and down stairs a real chore. I try not to complain, but it’s… annoying. And it’s getting harder to ignore, if I’m honest. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Now… not so much. It just feels… creaky. Like an old door. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. A dull, aching pain that worsens with activity and cold weather – that’s very descriptive. And the comparison to an old door is quite apt. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees, or any locking or giving-way sensations?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe a little, after a long day. It’s hard to tell, you know? I don’t really look at them that closely. Redness? No, I don’t think so either. As for locking… no, they don’t actually lock. They just… feel stiff. And giving way… no, they haven’t given way. They just… protest when I try to move them. Honestly, I just try to ignore it as much as possible. I don't want to be a bother, you know? I’ve always been one to just… tough it out. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Calvery. Many people prefer to tough things out. But it's important to address these concerns, even if you haven’t found it particularly bothersome until recently. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about… things. Let me think. Harold had high blood pressure, I know that. But me? I don’t think so. The doctor always said I was perfectly healthy, right up until… well, you know. I had my usual check-ups, of course. But I can't really remember anything specific. I don't have diabetes, I'm pretty sure of that. I don't take any regular medications either, except for a little something for my arthritis, but that's just as needed. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I'm probably forgetting something important… But honestly, I’m not really sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Calvery. We can review your medical records to confirm. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… hmm. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And I had a hysterectomy… I think it was in the 70s? Something like that. It was… routine. And I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. Fell down the stairs. But other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Except for Harold, of course. That wasn't lucky at all. Is that helpful? It’s all a bit fuzzy, you know. So many years…
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. Thank you. And I understand it can be difficult to recall details from many years ago. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he smoked a lot. I think he had something with his lungs, but I don’t remember the details. Harold’s mother had arthritis, really bad. And his father… he was a healthy man, as far as I know. But honestly, we didn’t talk about these things much. It wasn’t really the done thing, you know? We just… dealt with things as they came. I’m probably not much help. Is that alright? It’s all very hazy. I wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Family history can be difficult to recall, and you’ve provided what you could, which is very helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. Harold tried it once or twice, but I wouldn’t allow it in the house. Absolutely dreadful habit. I always said so. I do enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes, though. A glass or two. Nothing excessive. Is that alright? I've always been quite careful, you know. Moderation in all things, that's what I always say. My daughter worries about that too, sometimes. She thinks I should cut back. But a little wine helps me relax.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Calvery. A glass or two of wine with dinner is fine. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. My daughter’s a bit of a fussy eater, but I’ve always been quite robust. I remember when I was a child, we didn’t worry about allergies like they do now. Everyone just ate everything. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. Is that helpful? Honestly, I’m a pretty simple person. Not much bothers me. Except for Harold being gone, of course. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that is certainly not an allergy, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your knees. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, dear. I trust your judgment. I've always been a bit of a worrier myself, so I'm happy to let you do whatever you need to do. Just be gentle with my knees, if you don't mind. They're getting more sensitive with age. And please, don't rush. I'm not going anywhere. Take your time. I'm sure you're very busy. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a murmur, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? My mother had a weak heart, you know. Maybe it’s… hereditary? I’m not surprised, really. I've never been one for exercise, so it's probably just… old age. Ooh, that’s a bit stiff. And creaky. There we go. That’s about as far as they’ll go, I’m afraid. Don’t push them, dear. They’ll protest something awful. Is that alright? I told you they were getting sensitive. Can you feel the creakiness? It’s like… sandpaper rubbing together. Awful, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I can feel some crepitus – that’s the grating sound you’re describing – and a slight tenderness along the joint line on both sides. There’s no significant swelling at the moment. The range of motion is limited, as you mentioned. The ligaments feel stable, which is good. It appears you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, which is a common condition with age. It’s causing the pain, stiffness, and crepitus you’re experiencing. The murmur is something we will monitor, but for now, it doesn't appear to be an immediate concern. Do you have any questions so far, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, osteoarthritis, you say? That sounds… serious. Is that what Harold had in his hands? He couldn’t open jars towards the end. Is that what this is? And you said something about a murmur… is that my heart? Is it… dangerous? I don't want to end up in the hospital. I hate hospitals. Everything just feels so… uncertain, you know? And will this osteoarthritis get worse? Will I be stuck in a wheelchair? Oh dear. I'm getting all worked up now. My daughter always said I worry too much. But it’s hard not to, when you hear things like that. Is there anything… anything at all I can do about it?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel concerned, Ms. Calvery. Let’s address your questions one by one. Yes, it’s possible Harold had osteoarthritis in his hands. It’s a very common condition that affects the joints. As for the murmur, yes, it’s a sound coming from your heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is dangerous, but it’s something we need to monitor. We’ll likely repeat an EKG and possibly order an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of the heart – just to get a clearer picture. Now, regarding your osteoarthritis. It is a progressive condition, meaning it can worsen over time. However, there are many things we can do to manage it and slow down the progression. It is unlikely you will end up in a wheelchair. We can start with lifestyle modifications – weight management, low-impact exercise like walking or swimming – and physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees. We can also discuss pain management options, such as over-the-counter pain relievers or, if needed, prescription medications. Does that help to ease some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that does sound a bit better. Weight management… well, I do enjoy my food. But I suppose I could try. And walking… that’s not so bad. I used to enjoy a good walk. But swimming… I haven’t been in a pool in years. And physical therapy… will that be painful? I don't want to be stretched and pulled and… Oh dear. And the medications… I don't like taking pills. I always feel so… sluggish. Is there anything else I can do? Something… gentler? Maybe some creams or something? Or some exercises I can do at home? I just want to be able to walk without feeling like an old woman. Is that too much to ask? My daughter keeps saying I need to accept my age. But I don’t want to just… give up.
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Calvery. And you absolutely shouldn't feel like you need to just give up. We will work together to find a plan that suits your needs and preferences. You are right to ask about gentler options. We can certainly start with those. There are several topical creams and gels containing capsaicin or NSAIDs that can help reduce pain and inflammation. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do at home to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. I can provide you with a handout outlining some specific exercises and stretches. I recommend we start with those options – the cream, the exercises, and weight management – and see how you respond. If those aren't enough, we can then discuss other options, such as physical therapy or, if needed, medication. I will write a prescription for a topical NSAID cream and I’ll have the nurse print out the exercise handout for you. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to see how you’re progressing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfect, dear. A cream, exercises… I can manage that. Six weeks… that gives me time to get used to it. I'm glad you're not rushing me into anything. And the exercises… are they difficult? I don't want to fall and break something. My daughter would never forgive me. And the nurse… she’s very nice, isn’t she? Always so cheerful. I like her. Thank you, Dr. Stilaire. You've put my mind at ease. I was so worried, but now I feel… hopeful. Maybe I won’t end up in a wheelchair after all. Perhaps I can even take up gardening again. I used to love gardening. Yes, thank you. You're a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I'm glad I could help. The exercises are very gentle and designed to be safe for people of all fitness levels. The nurse will go over them with you in detail and make sure you understand them properly. She’s excellent, isn't she?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. Well, I suppose I should be going. It's been lovely talking to you, Dr. Stilaire. Thank you again for everything. I do hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time. Doctors are so busy, you know. And please, tell the nurse I said hello. She’s a real sweetheart. I think that’s all for now. I’ll see you in six weeks, then? If I haven’t fallen and broken a hip by then, of course.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Calvery. And no, you haven’t taken up any of my time at all. I’m always happy to spend time with my patients. I’ll be sure to pass along your kind words to the nurse. Yes, we’ll see you in six weeks. And please, don’t worry about falling! Just take things slow and listen to your body. Take care, Ms. Calvery. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment.
