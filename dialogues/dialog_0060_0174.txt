DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nooruddin. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself lately. I feel rather low, and truthfully, it’s been going on for a bit. I suppose you could say I'm feeling quite depressed. I just want to get it sorted, if possible. I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: "Depressed," you say. Alright. And how long has this “not yourself” feeling been going on, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's difficult to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. Time does rather slip away, doesn’t it? It started gradually, I believe, not a sudden thing. Just a… a dimming, if you will. Everything feels a bit…grey.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And is there anything specific that you think might have triggered this, or did it just… happen?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm. That's a good question. My divorce was… final about a year ago. That was rather unpleasant, of course. But that feels… settled now. Nothing new has happened. Perhaps it's just…age? I don't know. I really wish I could put my finger on it. I've always been a practical woman, and this feeling…it's very unhelpful.
DOCTOR: A year ago… the divorce. And you feel this has little to do with it?
PATIENT: Oh, it certainly wasn’t pleasant, Doctor. But I’ve… adjusted. I have my own place now, and I keep busy with my work. Lifeguarding keeps one occupied, you know. Though it’s rather slow this time of year. It’s not as if I’m dwelling on it, not consciously, anyway. It just feels… like a weight, a general unhappiness. I don't want to bore you with details, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Lifeguarding, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. And ski patrol in the winter, when the weather permits. I've been doing it for years. It keeps me fit, and I enjoy being outside. Though lately…even that doesn't seem to lift my spirits. It’s just…effort, you see? It’s all just effort. I’m a strong woman, Doctor. I’m not used to feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sleeping alright?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Hmm. Not wonderfully, truthfully. I fall asleep easily enough, but I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes it’s a noise, sometimes…nothing at all. Just…awareness. I'm not in any pain, but I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It's a rather irritating cycle, really. I used to sleep like a log.
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, that's diminished, certainly. I used to enjoy cooking, a good Nigerian meal, you understand. But now…I just don't feel particularly hungry. I eat because I know I should, not because I want to. Everything seems to taste…bland. Like cardboard, almost. I’ve lost a bit of weight, I suppose, though I haven't been keeping track. It’s just…another thing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't believe in filling myself with pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to…handle things myself, if possible. I’ve always been quite healthy, you see. Just this…unsettled feeling. It's very unlike me. I am insured, of course, private insurance. I just want to know if there's something… straightforward I can do to feel better. I don't have all day for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're experiencing some classic symptoms of… low mood, which could be a number of things. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. What a dreadful question! I am a practical woman, as I said. I wouldn’t dream of such a thing. I find that thought… rather unsettling, to be frank. No, Doctor, I am not suicidal. I simply want to feel like myself again, and get on with my life. I have work to do, you see. A lot of work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, sometimes these things can be attributed to simple vitamin deficiencies. It's common, particularly as one gets older. Let's run a basic blood panel to check your Vitamin D, B12, and iron levels. It’s a simple test, and it will rule out some of the more straightforward causes. We can also check your thyroid function, just to be thorough. If everything comes back normal, we may need to discuss other options, potentially… seeing a therapist. But let's start with the blood work, shall we?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. Blood work is fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a shift at the pool next week, and I need to be at my best. As long as this is all quite quick, I’m happy to proceed. Can we get it done today? And will I need a referral for anything? I prefer to handle things directly, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do the blood work today. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes. I'll order the tests now. As for a referral…let's see what the results show first. It's often best to start with the basics. Here you are. Take this to the lab, and they'll take care of it. Results should be back in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…efficient enough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting this sorted quickly. I’ll go to the lab straight away. Just… let me know when and where the follow-up is. I have a busy schedule, you understand. Good day. .
DOCTOR: The receptionist will call you with a follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
