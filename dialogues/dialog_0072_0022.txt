DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I am Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… it’s my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want much to eat anymore. Not like before. It just… doesn't feel right. I don't really know why, you see. It just is.
DOCTOR: “Feels big,” you say. And a decreased appetite. I see. Could you elaborate on “doesn’t feel right”?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say. Not… painful, exactly. Just… full. And heavy, maybe? Like I swallowed a big… a big melon, but I didn’t. It's… uncomfortable when I lie down, mostly. And I get tired easier, I think. Is that… part of it? I forget things so easily now, it’s hard to tell what’s new.
DOCTOR: “Heavy” and uncomfortable when lying down. And fatigue. Yes, well, fatigue is quite common at your age, Ms. McConnon. It could be a number of things. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Oh… gradually, I think. It didn’t just happen one day. More… little by little. Weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say. Time… it all blurs together these days. I used to be able to remember dates, you know. I was a… a sociologist. We had to remember things! But now… not so much.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over weeks. And you were a sociologist, requiring strong recall. I understand. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. What does that… mean? I go to the bathroom, of course. But… is something wrong with that? I don’t know if it’s different. Maybe… a little harder sometimes? But I eat so little now, I suppose everything is… smaller. Is that what you mean? I’m sorry, Doctor. I don't understand all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: No, no apologies necessary, Ms. McConnon. I simply want to get a complete picture. When you use the restroom, is there any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, no, no blood. Not that I've seen. I… I always look. Old habits, you know? From… from being careful. But no. Everything looks… normal. Just… less of it. Because I don’t eat much. It’s just… a little worried about feeling so full when my tummy is empty. Does that make sense? It’s a strange feeling. A very strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss, besides the decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Oh… nausea… sometimes. A little queasy. Not much. And… I haven’t thrown up. No. And… weight loss… I don’t know. I haven’t been weighed in a long time. I used to be… heavier, I think. But that was… a long time ago. I just feel… smaller. Does that count? It’s hard to tell. I don't have a scale, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. McConnon, given your age and these symptoms—the fullness, decreased appetite, fatigue, and gradual onset—we need to investigate this further. I'm going to perform a physical examination now, and then I'll order some blood work. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Alright. I suppose so. And blood work… oh dear. I don't like needles. But… if you think it's necessary. No allergies, no. And I don’t take any pills. Haven’t for years. Just… a little tea sometimes. For my tummy. Is that alright? I hope it doesn't interfere with anything.
DOCTOR: Tea is unlikely to interfere. Very well. Let's begin with the examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your abdomen, and then I'll gently palpate it to assess for any tenderness or masses. Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat diminished. There is some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no significant masses are palpable at this time. I do note some mild abdominal distension. It appears we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We'll also need to do a stool test to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. A stool test? That sounds… unpleasant. But I’ll do it. Is it going to be very painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a friend… I promised to visit her. I hope it won't take too long. I get so forgetful, I might forget why I was visiting!
DOCTOR: The stool test is not painful, Ms. McConnon. It simply requires a small sample. The lab will provide you with instructions. As for the results, it typically takes 3-5 business days for everything to come back. I will have the results sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to eat light meals as tolerated and stay well-hydrated. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… 3 to 5 days. Alright. Light meals… I can do that. And stay hydrated. Yes. No severe pain… I’ll try to remember that. Um… well… do you think it's something serious, Doctor? I know you don't want to worry me, but… I always like to know. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Besides eating light meals? I used to make a special tea… with chamomile. Would that be alright? It helps me calm my tummy sometimes. Maybe… it will help with the swelling? It’s probably silly. I just… worry so much.
DOCTOR: “Something serious” is far too broad a term, Ms. McConnon. We need the test results before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. Chamomile tea is unlikely to have a significant impact, but it's unlikely to cause any harm, as long as you don’t consume excessive amounts. I'm ordering a referral to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion, just to be thorough. They may recommend further testing, such as an abdominal ultrasound or endoscopy. For now, focus on staying hydrated and eating light meals. And please, try not to worry excessively. We are taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your discomfort. Do you have any further questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… a gastroenterologist? More doctors… Alright. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been… very helpful. Even if I forget half of what you said. Where do I go to… get the stool test? And… where will the results be sent? I don't want to lose the paper. I have a habit of doing that. It’s just… so much. .
DOCTOR: My staff will provide you with the necessary instructions and collection kit for the stool test before you leave. The results will be sent directly to my office, and we will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do not worry about losing the paperwork; we will keep a copy on file as well. If you have any urgent concerns before your follow-up appointment, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a pleasant day, Ms. McConnon.
