DOCTOR: Hi Blain, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my family. A lot of heart problems, you know? My grandfather died young, pretty sudden. My mom’s got it too, always tired, always at the doctor. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, I guess. It’s probably nothing, but it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's smart to be proactive, especially with a family history like that. We can definitely do some things to check things out and give you some peace of mind. So, let’s start with some details. Can you tell me a little more about your mom's condition?
PATIENT: Honestly? She doesn't really do details. She just complains about being winded, feeling weak. She’s got a cardiologist, I think, but she never shares specifics. It’s… frustrating, to be frank. She says “it’s under control,” but then she’s constantly cancelling plans because she “doesn’t feel up to it.” She’s not the most forthcoming person. I guess she doesn’t want to worry anyone, but it just makes me worry more.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable – it's tough when family members aren't open about their health. Okay, so you're experiencing anxiety related to your family history and wanting to get a baseline assessment for yourself. Has you been experiencing any symptoms at all – things like chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, everyone gets tired, right? And I work long hours, sometimes. I’m a teacher, at the college. It can be stressful, grading papers and dealing with students…but it’s not like sudden fatigue or anything. No chest pain, no dizziness. Honestly, if I didn’t know about my family, I wouldn’t even be here. It’s just…a nagging feeling. I guess. I'm pretty fit, I try to go to the gym a few times a week. I eat okay. So, I don’t feel like there's anything wrong. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. You're proactive and aware of your family history, and you're generally healthy, which is great. It sounds like we're dealing with a good amount of anxiety, which is totally valid. Let’s do a basic physical exam just to get a starting point, and then we can talk about some possible next steps, like maybe some blood work to check your cholesterol and other heart-related markers. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. I just… I don’t want a big fuss, you know? I have a lot going on. And honestly, I'm not a fan of doctors in general. Always poking and prodding. I just want to get this checked off the list and know I’m probably fine. It’s probably just genetics worrying me for nothing. But… better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll keep it as quick and straightforward as possible. I promise, no unnecessary poking and prodding. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look at your general health. Then we can talk about the blood work. It will give us some good information. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can you just relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. I'm usually pretty good at relaxing, actually. Yoga and all that. Just… don’t tell me it's high if it is, okay? I don't need that stress right now. Is that weird? I just... I deal with a lot of… demanding students. It raises my blood pressure just thinking about them.
DOCTOR: It's not weird at all. It’s good to be aware of what stresses you out. And it's perfectly fine to want to avoid unnecessary worry. Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. Pulse is 68 and regular. Now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. In and out… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had any trouble with that. I eat everything. I’m Indian, we have a lot of spices…builds up your tolerance, you know? So, no, nothing. See? Perfectly healthy. Can we just get the blood work scheduled? The sooner I know everything is fine, the better. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time, but my sister insisted I come. She's always been a bit of a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And it’s good that you’re able to tell me that you’re generally feeling healthy. Just to cover all the bases, I want to ask a few quick questions about your family history specifically. You mentioned your mom and sister. Does anyone else in your family have a history of high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, or early heart attacks?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Now you’re asking about everyone? My grandfather, on my mother’s side, died really young. Heart attack, I think. Early fifties, maybe? And…my uncle, her brother, had a stroke a few years ago. He's doing okay now, I think, but it was pretty bad. And…my sister, the one who made me come here, she’s always getting her cholesterol checked. It’s borderline high, she says. She's constantly on about it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Is that enough family history for you?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like there is a definite family predisposition to heart disease and stroke. It's good we're getting a clearer picture. Given that history, even though you're currently feeling well, it's definitely a good idea to get some baseline blood work done. We’ll check your cholesterol levels, triglycerides, blood sugar, and a few other markers to get a more complete assessment. I’m going to order a lipid panel and a complete metabolic panel. Do you have any preferred lab?
PATIENT: Nope, no preference. Whatever’s easiest, honestly. I have Medicare, so I guess it has to be one they accept, right? I just want to get this over with. And… can I get the results online? I don’t want to have to keep calling back and forth. I have a busy schedule. And please, no alarmist language in the report. I can handle the facts, I just don't need anyone telling me I'm about to drop dead. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. We’ll make sure the lab accepts Medicare, and you can definitely access your results online through the patient portal. I’ll make a note to ensure the report is factual and avoids any alarmist language. I’m ordering the tests now. You can go to any [LabCorp/Quest Diagnostics - choose one] location. They'll likely want to see your insurance card and ID. Do you have a copy of your insurance card handy?
PATIENT: Here. Everything’s pretty standard. And honestly, it's probably just going to be normal. I can feel it. It's my sister, always worrying. She's a nurse, you know? Everything's a crisis with her. She probably made me come here just to prove a point.
DOCTOR: Okay, I have your insurance information. Alright, so I’m sending the order to [LabCorp/Quest Diagnostics - choose one]. They should be able to see it right away. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, are there any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: Nope. That’s everything. Just get the blood work done, tell me everything’s fine, and I can go back to dealing with demanding students. Honestly, they’re a bigger health risk than my family history.
