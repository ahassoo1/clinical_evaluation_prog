DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. It’s disgusting, really. And it burns. Been happening for… well, a while now. I don’t have time for this, to be honest. Just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I see. "Stuff coming up" – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: What do you mean “a little more”? It’s… food. And acid. It just… comes back up. Especially after I eat. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Though, maybe richer foods are worse. I don’t know. I don’t sit around analyzing my regurgitation, if that’s what you’re expecting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. You don't need to analyze it, just describe it as best you can. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some regurgitation – food and acid coming back up, particularly after eating, and it seems to be worse with richer foods. Has this been happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Consistently! What a question. It’s… pretty much always there, to some degree. Some days it's a little bit, some days it’s… well, unpleasant. It’s been like this for months, maybe even a year. Honestly, I just figured it was getting old. Is that what happens when you get old? Everything comes back up?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this up now, Mr. Altine. While some changes can happen with age, consistent regurgitation for months, or even a year, isn’t something to simply accept. It’s definitely worth investigating. To get a better understanding, could you describe the sensation when this happens?
PATIENT: Sensation? What kind of sensation do you want? It burns, obviously. Like heartburn, but… higher up. And it's just… gross. Like food trying to escape. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And embarrassing. Honestly, I don't like talking about this. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: I understand this is uncomfortable to discuss, Mr. Altine, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. So, it sounds like a burning sensation, higher up than typical heartburn, and you describe it as food trying to escape. No significant pain, just discomfort and embarrassment. To clarify, does this happen only after eating, or does it occur at other times, such as when lying down or bending over?
PATIENT: Mostly after eating, yeah. Big meals are worse. And… sometimes when I lie down. Not every time, but often. I sleep with my head propped up, actually. Helps a bit. Though, I wake up with a dry mouth all the time. Look, is this going to involve a camera or something? Because I’m not doing a camera.
DOCTOR: No camera at this stage, Mr. Altine. We're not jumping to any procedures right now. I just want to gather some more information to understand what might be going on. You mentioned waking up with a dry mouth. Do you experience any other symptoms, such as a sour taste in your mouth, difficulty swallowing, or a cough, particularly at night?
PATIENT: Sour taste? Sometimes. Hard to say, honestly. Everything tastes bad when it’s coming back up, doesn't it? And no, I can swallow fine. I haven’t had any problems with that. Cough? A little bit, maybe. Old man cough. Everyone coughs. Look, I’m a healthy guy. Emergency Management Director, remember? I deal with real problems. This is just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Right, Emergency Management Director – that's good to know. And I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you’re generally healthy, and this is a bothersome issue rather than a serious one. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any weight loss recently, or any difficulty breathing or chest pain?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I'm carrying a little extra. And no breathing problems. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but that's just… getting older. And chest pain? No. Just heartburn. Are we almost done here? I have a meeting in an hour.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. No weight loss, no difficulty breathing or chest pain, just heartburn and regurgitation, primarily after meals and sometimes when lying down, with a dry mouth upon waking. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Been on medication for that for… oh, ten years, maybe? Otherwise, no. I don’t do medical conditions. I manage emergencies, I don’t have them. Take the pills, blood pressure goes down. That’s it. And I have private insurance, if that matters. I don’t want any surprises with the bills.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the high blood pressure, and thank you for letting me know about your insurance. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Let me think... Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. Every day. Been taking it for years. And… that’s it. Really. I’m not a complicated case. Can we please wrap this up? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Lisinopril 10mg daily for high blood pressure. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. I manage disasters, remember? You gotta be able to eat anything they throw at you. Are you writing all this down? Because I'm telling you, it's not much. Healthy guy, high blood pressure, a little heartburn. That's it. Now, what's the plan? Are you going to give me a pill or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm writing everything down, Mr. Altine. And you’re right, you sound generally healthy. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. To confirm this and rule out anything more serious, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That involves listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t poke too much. And no lectures about diet, okay? I know what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Of course, no lectures, Mr. Altine. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Just annoyed. Can we be done now? I'm telling you, I'm fine. Probably just need some antacids. Is that what you're going to say? Because I can just go buy some myself. Save everyone a lot of time.
DOCTOR: You're right, antacids can provide some relief, Mr. Altine. However, since this has been ongoing for a while, and you’re on medication for high blood pressure, I’d like to start with a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which is a stronger medication to reduce stomach acid. I’m going to prescribe Omeprazole, 20mg once daily for four weeks. If your symptoms improve, we can discuss continuing it or adjusting the dosage. If they don’t improve, we can then consider further testing, such as an endoscopy. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever you think. Omeprazole, you said? Four weeks. Just get it over with. I have a meeting. Just write down the prescription and I'll get out of here. I don't need a lot of explanations. I manage emergencies, I can read instructions. Thanks. Or whatever.
DOCTOR: Here's the prescription for Omeprazole, Mr. Altine. Take one tablet each morning, preferably 30 minutes before a meal. I’ll also send a note to your pharmacy. If you experience any side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, or constipation, please let me know. And if your symptoms don’t improve after four weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss further testing. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… thank you. Or whatever. I have a meeting. .
