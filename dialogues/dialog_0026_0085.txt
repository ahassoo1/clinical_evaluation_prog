DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not that you would understand the importance of maintaining a proper appearance, I’m sure. But it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly valid to be concerned about changes to your skin, and wanting to address them. Appearance is important. Can you tell me a little more about this discoloration?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… patches, really. Sort of a brownish hue. It started a few months ago, I think. Though, honestly, I don't keep meticulous track of these things. It’s not like it’s a life-threatening issue. It’s mostly on my arms and a little on my face. I use a very good moisturizer, you know. Imported. But it hasn’t helped. Perhaps it’s the water here? It certainly doesn't have the quality of what I’m used to.
DOCTOR: A few months ago… and on your arms and face, you said. Okay. And it’s a brownish hue. Has it been changing in size or shape at all since it started?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes, I suppose it has. It’s… subtle, but I think the patches are a bit larger. And maybe… darker? Honestly, it's difficult to say precisely. I don't spend my days scrutinizing my skin, Doctor. I have more important things to attend to than that. It's just… unsightly. Do you need me to be specific about the exact millimeter measurements? I really don't think that's necessary.
DOCTOR: No, millimeter measurements aren't necessary right now. It’s helpful to know it’s been gradually changing, though. Has it been itchy, painful, or causing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. It doesn't feel different at all. It's purely a cosmetic issue, really. It's just... visually displeasing. I wouldn’t dream of going out in public without concealer, you know. It’s quite a nuisance. And my husband, well, he hasn’t said anything, but I can tell he notices. Men are so… oblivious, generally. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no itching, pain, or other feelings associated with it. And it’s primarily a concern about the appearance. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my health? Goodness, no. I’m perfectly healthy. I eat a balanced diet – mostly Ukrainian cuisine, of course, it’s the best – and I get plenty of rest. Though, truthfully, the stress of maintaining a proper household is quite taxing. I do take a multivitamin, religiously. A very good brand. Imported, naturally. I suppose that counts for something. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. Well, a little cold last winter, but that’s hardly noteworthy.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And no family history of similar skin conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something. A rash, I think. But it was a very long time ago, and she lived in the countryside. They didn’t have proper medical care back then. It was probably just some allergy or something. I doubt it’s relevant. My mother always had beautiful skin, so I suspect it was an isolated incident. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure we need to delve into ancient family history? It seems rather… excessive.
DOCTOR: It’s always helpful to have as much information as possible, even if it seems distant. Okay. Let’s move on to any medications you're currently taking, other than the multivitamin.
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, really. And occasionally, I take something for… digestive issues. It’s a herbal remedy, actually. My cousin sends it from Ukraine. It’s much more effective than anything they sell here, I assure you. It’s all natural, of course. No harsh chemicals. I don’t believe in those things. The name… let me think. It’s… Zelenyi Listok. Something like that. Green Leaf, I suppose it translates to. It's not a prescription, obviously. You wouldn’t find anything like it in a pharmacy here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zelenyi Listok for digestive issues. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I’m not particularly fond of beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m very careful about what I put in my body, you know. I’m not one of those people who just eats anything without thinking. It’s simply… bad for you. And I’m quite sensitive to strong perfumes, but that’s just a personal preference. It gives me a headache. But an actual allergy? No. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Would you mind if I took a look at the discoloration on your arms and face?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, please do. It’s really quite unsightly, as I’ve mentioned. I do apologize for the inconvenience, but I have a luncheon to attend afterwards. I hope this won't take too long. I'm wearing a rather delicate blouse, so please be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick and careful as possible. Please, have a seat. Let's start by taking a look at your arms. Could you please raise them for me?
PATIENT: There. Do be gentle, Doctor. It really is quite fragile fabric. Honestly, the things one must endure for appearances… It's simply dreadful. You'll see it's rather brownish, not a pleasant shade at all. And it's spreading, I'm quite certain of it.
DOCTOR: I see the patches on your arms. They appear to be somewhat irregular in shape and… …they are slightly raised. The texture feels a bit rough compared to the surrounding skin. And you mentioned it’s on your face as well?
PATIENT: Yes, on my face, too. Though it's not as prominent there, thankfully. It's mostly around my temples and a little on my forehead. It's so subtle, one could almost miss it, but I notice, of course. It's terribly distracting. Honestly, Doctor, it looks almost… mottled. Is that what you call it? Mottled? It's quite alarming, really. Do you think it's serious? Please tell me it's nothing serious. I have a reputation to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: I see the discoloration on your face as well. It appears similar to what we observed on your arms - slightly irregular, and a brownish hue. “Mottled” is a good description. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but based on what I’m seeing, it could be a number of things. It doesn’t immediately appear to be anything acutely concerning, but it's important to rule out potential causes. We can start with some basic blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, dear. Must we? I detest needles. And I'm always so lightheaded afterwards. But… if it's necessary, I suppose I have no choice. It's just… terribly inconvenient. And I do hope it won't take too long. I have a bridge game scheduled for tomorrow. And I simply must be at my best. Do you promise it won't interfere with my schedule? And will it leave a bruise? I bruise so easily, you wouldn't believe.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood draw itself shouldn't take long – just a few minutes. And we’ll take precautions to minimize bruising. I can’t guarantee there won't be any discoloration at all, as everyone reacts differently, but we’ll use a small needle and apply pressure afterwards. The tests will help us to rule out any underlying causes for the discoloration and ensure we're on the right track. I'll order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A complete blood count and… a metabolic panel. Yes, I suppose that sounds… thorough. Though I still maintain it's probably just a cosmetic issue. But do what you must, Doctor. Just please be quick. And make sure the phlebotomist is experienced. I've had some dreadful experiences in the past. They simply cannot find my veins, you see. It's terribly frustrating. And I do hope you have comfortable chairs in the waiting room. This is all rather… unsettling. Do you accept Ukrainian currency? I happen to have some on hand.
DOCTOR: We’ll certainly ensure the phlebotomist is experienced and gentle. I'll make a note to inform them of your concerns. And unfortunately, we don’t accept Ukrainian currency here, but we can certainly process a payment with a card or insurance. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. Afterwards, we can discuss the next steps, and I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for any further testing if needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… adequate. Just please hurry. And do tell the technician to use a warm compress beforehand. It helps, you know. My veins are rather shy. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. And do make sure they use a new needle. I wouldn't dream of allowing them to reuse one. That's simply… unsanitary. I've read dreadful things about infections. Very dreadful. Is there anything I should do to prepare? Perhaps I should have a snack beforehand? I get terribly faint when I'm nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll inform the technician to use a warm compress and a fresh needle. And yes, it’s a good idea to have a small snack beforehand, especially since you’re prone to feeling faint when nervous. Something light, like a cracker or a piece of fruit, would be ideal. It will help to keep your blood sugar stable. I’ll have the technician come in shortly. Just relax, and try to take a few deep breaths. Everything will be alright.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose I have no choice. But do be quick, please. This is all terribly disruptive to my day. And do remind the technician to be gentle. I simply cannot emphasize that enough. Honestly, one would think they could develop a less… invasive method for this sort of thing. It’s the 21st century, after all.
