DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Seil, was it? Yes, well, it's this tiredness, you see. Just… dragging. And the young man at the lab said something about my numbers being… off. Creatine… something? I don't keep up with these things, honestly. My husband usually handles all that. He’s out getting groceries right now. It's just been getting worse, this feeling. Makes it hard to even walk to the shops.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Oitker, Seil is correct. And thank you for letting me know your husband is out. We can certainly discuss the tiredness and those lab results. It’s good you mentioned the creatine – that’s helpful. Just to clarify, you said the tiredness has been getting worse – could you tell me how long you’ve been feeling this way, and if anything specific seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a while now. Maybe a few months? Hard to say, really. Everything sort of blends together after a certain age, you know? As for what makes it worse… using my arms, definitely. I used to do a bit of gardening, but even that’s a struggle now. Lifting things… forget about it. Makes me ache all over. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Just resting, I suppose. Though even that doesn’t help much these days. I used to be so strong, you know. Commercial diving isn't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving! That is demanding work. It’s good to know that was part of your history – that gives me a better understanding. So, a few months of progressive fatigue, worsened by using your arms, and not much relief with rest. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the fatigue itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like… falling asleep tired, you understand? It's more like… everything is heavy. My limbs, my eyelids… even thinking feels like a chore. And it just doesn't go away. I wake up tired, and I stay tired all day. It’s just… a constant weight. Makes me quite irritable, to be honest. My husband says I’m no fun anymore, but what does he know? He doesn’t have to feel like this. It's a draining sort of tired, if that makes any sense. Not like I could run a marathon, but even simple things… like washing dishes… it takes all my energy.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Oitker. A draining fatigue, constant heaviness, and irritability. It sounds quite debilitating. I see in your chart your height is listed as 150 centimeters and your weight as 108 pounds. Have there been any recent changes in your weight – either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, you’ve got my height and weight right there? Fancy that. No, not really. I haven’t been weighing myself much lately, to be honest. My husband brings the groceries, and he just… knows what I usually buy. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I certainly haven’t been gaining weight! I try to watch what I eat, you know? Can’t let myself go completely. Everything is just… smaller these days. Smaller portions, smaller walks, smaller energy. It's all just… less.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Ms. Oitker. It’s helpful to know there haven’t been any changes in your weight or eating habits. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My husband handles all that paperwork, you know? I’ve got… well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they gave me a little pill for it. I take it every morning. Other than that… nothing much that I can recall. I used to be so healthy! All that diving kept me fit as a fiddle. Though it wasn't always easy on the body, to be honest. I've had my share of aches and pains over the years. But nothing… serious, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Oitker. It’s completely reasonable to want to feel like yourself again. And it's good you mentioned the blood pressure medication – that’s important. Do you happen to know the name of the medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking things my husband handles! Let me see… It’s a little white pill, I think. Small one. I take it with my breakfast every morning. As for the name… I honestly haven't the faintest. He fills the little pillbox for me every week, you see. I just take what he gives me. I’m afraid I’m not very good with names and numbers these days. It all blurs together, you know? I’m sure he could tell you, if you need to know. He's very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Oitker. We can certainly ask your husband when he comes. It’s good to know he handles your medications. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That's a bit of a tricky one. My husband is from a very large family, and I’ve never really kept up with all their ailments. I come from a small village in Bhutan, you see, and we haven't been in touch with many of my relatives for a very long time. There was my brother, he had… something with his heart, I think. But he passed away many years ago. Other than that, I honestly couldn’t say. We didn’t have much access to doctors back home, you see. Things were very different then. I don’t think anyone had… these kinds of problems. Mostly just aches and pains from working the land. It's all a bit hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Oitker. Family medical history can be difficult to recall, especially with distance and limited access to information. To complete the picture, could you tell me about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… I don't think I have any. I eat most things, as long as my husband cooks them. He's a very good cook, you know. I had a bit of a rash once, after touching a certain plant in the garden, but it wasn’t serious. And I’ve never had any trouble with medications, as far as I can recall. My husband always checks with the pharmacist before giving me anything new. He’s very cautious, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much help with these details. I just want to feel better. This tiredness is… draining the life out of me.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Ms. Oitker. And I appreciate you sharing what you can. It sounds like your husband is very attentive to your health, which is wonderful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never have, never will. My husband doesn't smoke either. It's a dreadful habit, you know. My mother always said it was bad for your health. We lived a very clean life back in Bhutan, mostly eating food grown on our own land. We didn’t have much access to processed foods or… things like that. It was a simple life, but a healthy one, I think. We didn't need many doctors back then, honestly. It's all changed so much now. I just want to feel like I have some energy again. This is so unlike me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Oitker. A healthy lifestyle is very important. And it sounds like you’ve maintained good habits throughout your life. Finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, very occasionally. Just a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. My husband enjoys a bit of wine, and I'll have a sip with him. It's mostly just a social thing, you know? We don't drink very much at all. It’s not like we sit around and… well, you know. Just a little glass with dinner, sometimes. Nothing more than that, I assure you. It certainly hasn’t been causing any problems, as far as I can tell. I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is… unsettling. It's just not me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My husband always says it's best to get things checked out properly. I just hope you can figure out what's causing this tiredness. It's truly draining. I used to be so active, you know? Gardening, walking… now I struggle to even wash the dishes. Do you think it could be something serious? I don't want to worry my husband, but… it's just not like me. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It can fluctuate, so we’ll monitor it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in your upper right quadrant. It’s not severe, but we'll keep that in mind. Your pulses are good and strong. There’s no noticeable swelling or discoloration in your extremities. Based on this brief examination, and your reported symptoms, I'd like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll check your kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work? All those numbers… I don't understand any of that. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. My husband will be glad to hear you're being thorough. He's always saying it's best to rule things out. Liver function… kidney levels… it all sounds rather serious. Do you think it could be something… bad? I don't want to worry him unnecessarily, but… I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is… draining the life out of me. What will the blood work tell you, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Oitker. It's natural to feel anxious when we don't understand what's happening. The blood work will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any potential underlying causes for your fatigue. Specifically, checking your kidney function will tell us how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Liver function tests will assess the health of your liver. Thyroid levels will help us determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly, as an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue. And the complete blood count will check for any signs of anemia or infection. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s best to be thorough. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I'd like to also order a urinalysis – a simple urine test – just to get a bit more information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a urinalysis too? All these tests… it's a bit overwhelming, Doctor. But if you think it's necessary, then yes, alright. My husband will be glad to hear I’m getting everything checked out. He's a very practical man, you know? He always says it’s best to know what you’re dealing with. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I don’t want to worry him, and I certainly don’t want to become a burden. This tiredness is… it's just so unlike me. I used to be so active, always on the go. Now I struggle to even walk to the shops. What happens if the tests do show something is wrong? Will I have to go to the hospital? I’ve never been a fan of hospitals, you know. They always smell so… sterile. And the beeping noises… it’s enough to make anyone feel worse. Perhaps it's just old age catching up with me. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these tests and what the results might show. Let's address your questions one at a time. Firstly, regarding the tests, we’re doing them to gather information, not to scare you. It's much better to know what’s going on so we can address it effectively. As for what happens if the tests do show something is wrong, it depends on the results. If we find something that needs further investigation, we’ll discuss all your options, including the possibility of seeing a specialist. It might involve further testing, but it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll have to go to the hospital. We'll explore all the least invasive options first. And finally, you mentioned old age. It's true that fatigue can be a natural part of aging, but it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes first. That's what these tests are for. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to get as much rest as possible, drink plenty of fluids, and eat a healthy diet. Avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please contact the clinic immediately. Shall we schedule a follow-up appointment for when the test results are back?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Rest, fluids, healthy diet… my husband will be glad to hear I’m following your advice. He's always telling me to take it easy. But I never listen, you know? I like to keep busy. It keeps my mind active. A follow-up appointment… yes, alright. When will the results be back? A few days, you said? And what if I do experience new symptoms? Should I come to the hospital? I really don’t want to go to the hospital, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is… draining the life out of me. I used to be so strong, so active. Now I struggle to even wash the dishes. It’s just not me. Perhaps it’s just old age catching up with me. Is that possible? I keep telling myself it's just old age, but… I can’t shake this feeling that something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 3 to 5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here’s a contact number for the clinic, and a number to reach me directly if you have any urgent concerns. If you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please contact the clinic immediately. We can assess your symptoms over the phone and determine if you need to be seen. It’s unlikely you’ll need to go to the hospital, but we’ll always err on the side of caution. You’re right to listen to your body, Ms. Oitker. It’s possible this is simply a sign of aging, but it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. That’s what we’re doing with these tests. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. For now, focus on getting rest, drinking fluids, and eating healthy. And remember, I’m here for you. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. My husband will be glad to hear I’m getting everything checked out properly. He's always saying it’s best to be prepared for the worst. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I don’t want to worry him, and I certainly don’t want to become a burden. This tiredness is… draining the life out of me. I used to be so strong, so active. Now I struggle to even wash the dishes. It’s just not me. Perhaps it’s just old age catching up with me. Is that possible? Well, thank you again, Doctor. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. And I’ll wait for your call about the test results. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Oitker. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well, and please give my best to your husband. We’ll be in touch soon.
