DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Results, yeah? I’m Kahrin, by the way. Just want to know what those tests showed, if that’s okay. I don’t really have time for a long chat, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kahrin, no problem. We can definitely get straight to the results. Just to confirm, those were the blood tests and the urine sample we took last week, right?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s the ones. Last Tuesday, I think it was. Look, I've got a pretty tight schedule today, so… just tell me what’s up, good or bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the good news is your complete blood count came back within normal limits – that rules out a lot of things. Your thyroid levels are also stable. However, the urine analysis did show a slightly elevated level of protein, and there were some white blood cells present. It's not dramatically high, but it's enough that we need to look into it a little further. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate, or have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm. Protein, you say? No, no pain or burning. Nothing like that. Color’s normal, as far as I can tell, and… smell? I don’t usually sniff my pee, Dr. Rosanova. Sorry. Is it… serious? What does this mean? I'm trying to figure out if I need to reschedule things.
DOCTOR: I understand, and no need to apologize! It’s good you’re asking. Elevated protein in the urine – we call it proteinuria – can have a lot of causes, most of which aren't emergencies. It could be something as simple as dehydration, strenuous exercise, or even a mild infection. But it can also be a sign of something more going on with your kidneys, so we need to investigate. To get a better idea of what's happening, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you been drinking your usual amount of fluids?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Maybe a little less lately, now that I'm so busy with work. Lots of long days, don’t have much time to stop and… hydrate, I guess. And I've been doing a bit more lifting at the gym, trying to get stronger. Is that probably it, then? Just the exercise and being busy?
DOCTOR: That’s definitely a possibility, Kahrin. Both exercise and dehydration can cause temporary proteinuria. However, to be on the safe side, I’d like to repeat the urine test in a week, just to see if the levels have returned to normal. Also, I’d like to check your blood pressure, and quickly listen to your heart and lungs. It'll only take a minute. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Blood pressure and… the listening stuff. I have a meeting at two, so… hurry it up, if you could?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be quick. Just relax your arm for me. Okay, blood pressure is 128/78, which is good. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, just to rule out anything else, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. I wear sandals pretty much all the time, so I wouldn’t even notice, probably. Look, are you going to give me a lecture about drinking more water? Because I already know I should. Is this test going to show something really bad? I really don’t have time for a kidney thing right now.
DOCTOR: No lecture, I promise. You're right, staying hydrated is important. And no, I'm not assuming anything is seriously wrong. We're just gathering information to rule things out. It's very common to get a slightly elevated protein reading occasionally, especially with increased activity. To be thorough, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Okay. My mom has high blood pressure, I think. And her sister… she had something with her kidneys, a long time ago. Needed a special diet, I remember that. But that was ages ago. Everyone on my dad’s side is pretty healthy, mostly just… island living, I guess. They eat lots of fish. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t really know much about it. We don't really talk about medical stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. The family history of high blood pressure and the kidney issue in your aunt are good things to be aware of. Okay, based on everything we’ve discussed, I think the most likely explanation is either dehydration from your busy schedule, or a temporary increase in protein due to exercise. However, given your aunt’s history, I'd like to be cautious and repeat the urine test next week. In the meantime, try to increase your fluid intake – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day – and try to get a little extra rest if you can. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Eight glasses… okay, I can try. No, I think that’s it. Just… do the test next week and tell me if it’s bad, and I’ll deal with it then. I really need to go. Thanks, Dr. Rosanova.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kahrin. We’ve scheduled you for a repeat urine test next week. If you experience any swelling, changes in urination, or feel unwell, please call the office immediately. Here’s a summary of our visit. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week.
