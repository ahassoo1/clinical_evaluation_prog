DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It’s… the university. The students. They simply don’t appreciate proper cataloging anymore. It's causing a great deal of… unpleasantness. I suppose you deal with… nerves, yes? It’s terribly disruptive to my routine.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it sounds like stress related to your work at the university is the main concern?
PATIENT: “Concern” is rather a strong word, Doctor. It’s… a professional inconvenience. A lowering of standards, really. And it’s been… accumulating. I don’t precisely enjoy feeling… unsettled. Though, I assure you, I've always been a very composed individual. It’s simply… not pleasant. Do you require a detailed list of the Dewey Decimal System errors I’ve observed? Because I could…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schlatterer, I understand. We don’t necessarily need a list of cataloging errors right now. Let’s focus on how this is affecting you personally. When you say “unsettled,” can you describe what that feels like, physically?
PATIENT: Physically? Well, one is… distracted. One doesn’t sleep as soundly. Though I maintain a rigorous schedule, naturally. And… my appetite is not quite what it once was. Though, I suspect that’s due to the sheer lack of intellectual stimulation around me. It's a vicious cycle, you see. Everything is…suboptimal. Honestly, I don’t understand why I’m detailing this to you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty sleeping and a decreased appetite. Anything else?
PATIENT: One finds oneself… short-tempered. Easily irritated by… incompetence. And a certain… tightness in the chest. Though, I assure you, it's nothing… serious. I was a very active hiker, you know. Excellent constitution. It’s simply… exasperation, really. A purely… mental affliction. Are we finished now? I have a rather important manuscript to review.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you been experiencing this tightness in your chest?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It comes and goes. It’s difficult to say precisely. Time loses all meaning when one is surrounded by… disorder. It's not a constant pain, Doctor. Simply… a discomfort. A persistent… annoyance. Honestly, this line of questioning is rather… unhelpful. Is there not something you can prescribe to improve the intellectual capacity of my students?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate your… detailed descriptions, I need to understand if this chest tightness is new or worsening. It’s important to rule out any potential cardiac issues, even if you believe it’s stress-related. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, dizziness, or pain radiating to your arm or jaw?
PATIENT: Cardiac issues? Good heavens! Are you suggesting I have a… heart condition? That’s preposterous! I’ve always been perfectly healthy. I… I may get a little breathless climbing stairs, perhaps, but that’s simply due to the altitude in my garden. And dizziness… well, one occasionally feels a bit lightheaded when correcting egregious errors in bibliographic citations. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite… insulting. I came here for a simple remedy for… professional frustration, not a… a physical examination! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to assess all potential causes for your symptoms. Given your age and the reported chest tightness, I strongly recommend an EKG and a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I'm also going to recommend you consult with a cardiologist. I will write you a referral. I understand you may not believe this is necessary, but it's better to be safe. Do you have any allergies or medications I should be aware of before I proceed with the referral?
