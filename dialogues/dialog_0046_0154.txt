DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… this trouble I’ve been having. With my… waterworks, you see? It keeps coming back. It’s rather unpleasant, and honestly, I just want it over with. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Trouble with your waterworks” – could you elaborate on that for me, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate…? Oh dear. Well, it… hurts when I go to the bathroom. And I have to go often. Very often. And… it doesn't always come out easily, if you understand. It’s just… uncomfortable. A lot. I've been drinking plenty of water, I think. Though, to be honest, I forget things these days. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort with urination – pain, frequency, and difficulty emptying your bladder. Yes, Ms. Wease, changes in memory can be quite common as we get older. We can certainly discuss that further as well. But let’s focus on your waterworks for now. When you say it’s been a while, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough estimate… That’s difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you see. It’ll feel better for a bit, then it comes back again. I can’t rightly say when it started exactly. I just remember feeling poorly. And needing to… well, you know. A lot. Is this… serious, Doctor? I really don't have time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent symptoms for around six months. I understand you're concerned about it being serious and wanting to avoid a lot of fuss, and we’ll certainly work to get to the bottom of this efficiently. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: The pain… well, it’s a burning. A burning sensation when I… go. And sometimes, even after I’ve gone, there’s a little ache. It's not a sharp pain, thankfully, more like a… discomfort. Like something's irritated. And sometimes it feels like… pressure. Low down, you understand? I hope that makes sense. I really don’t like talking about this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Burning with urination, a lingering ache afterwards, and a feeling of pressure. It sounds quite uncomfortable. You've been very brave sharing this with me, and I appreciate it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – like fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don't think so. I haven't felt hot or shivery. My back… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know. And blood…? I haven't… noticed anything like that. No. I’m quite sure. Though… I don’t always look, if you understand. It’s… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, is this something awful?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, back pain is usual for you, and no blood noticed. It's good you've been mindful of these things. It’s still too early to say definitively what’s going on, Ms. Wease, and I understand your anxiety. The symptoms you're describing could be a urinary tract infection, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order a urine test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test…? And an examination…? Oh dear. Well… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. But please be quick, Doctor. I have… things to do. And gentle, if you would be so kind. This all sounds… invasive. Is the test painful? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things as quickly and gently as possible, Ms. Wease. The urine test is a simple sample – you'll just need to provide a cup of urine, and it's not invasive at all. As for the exam, it's mostly external; I’ll listen to your abdomen and gently press on it to check for tenderness. I won’t be doing anything internal today. And I completely understand your concern about needles; we can discuss options if it becomes necessary, but the urine test doesn’t require one. First, let’s go ahead with the urine sample. I’ll show you where the restroom is, and I’ll give you a cup and some instructions.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A simple sample, you say? That sounds… manageable. Lead the way, Doctor. And please, do tell me exactly what I need to do. I wouldn’t want to do it wrong. This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here we are. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup about halfway through. There are instructions posted on the wall, and I can repeat them if you like. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Mid-stream… Right. Oh dear. Here you are. I hope that’s… sufficient. It wasn’t easy, I must say. This whole situation is rather distressing.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, this is perfect. And I apologize again for any distress this has caused you. Now, let’s have you sit back down on the examination table so I can listen to your abdomen. Just lie back comfortably and try to relax. I’ll just be listening for any unusual sounds or tenderness.
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick, Doctor. And gentle, as I said. I really don’t like being prodded and poked. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon appointment later, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long at all, Ms. Wease. Just a few moments. And I will be as gentle as possible. I promise. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Everything sounds normal so far, Ms. Wease. No unusual sounds or significant tenderness. Now, I’m going to send this urine sample to the lab for analysis. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back.
PATIENT: Normal, you say? That’s… reassuring. A couple of days… Well, I suppose that’s acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take longer. And what will you do once you have the results? Will I need… medication? I don’t particularly like taking pills. And are there any… lifestyle changes I should be making? I try to drink plenty of water, but as I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, once we have the results back, we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on. If it is a urinary tract infection, we’ll likely need to prescribe antibiotics. I understand you’re not fond of taking pills, so we can discuss the shortest possible course and explore any potential side effects. Regardless of the results, drinking plenty of fluids is always a good idea, and we can brainstorm strategies to help with your memory – like setting reminders or keeping a water bottle with you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. And it’s important to practice good hygiene – wiping front to back after using the restroom. I’m also going to order a complete blood count, just to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Let me see… I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I used to have a bit of a reaction to cats, but I haven’t been around a cat in years. And I’m fairly certain I’m not allergic to any medications. But… I did have a rather unpleasant experience with some shellfish a few years ago. I broke out in a rash, and my throat felt a little scratchy. But that could have been anything, really. Shellfish… Perhaps you should make a note of that, just in case. Is that all? Can I go now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish allergy noted. Thank you for letting me know. Yes, that’s all for today, Ms. Wease. We’ve covered a lot of ground. I’ve ordered the urine test and the complete blood count. The lab will contact you when the results are available, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s a copy of the lab request and a summary of today’s visit. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Fever, chills… Right. I’ll try to remember. No, I don’t think so. I believe you’ve covered everything. Thank you, Doctor. It’s been… thorough. Though rather unsettling, if I’m honest. I suppose I’ll be going now. I hope the results come quickly. And I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
