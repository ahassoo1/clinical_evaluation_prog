DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I haven't got all day. It's about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up beforehand. Says I'm too old to be making decisions for myself, the nerve. It’s a face lift. Is that what you need to know? Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: I see. A facelift, scheduled procedure. It’s certainly prudent to ensure you’re in optimal health beforehand, and your daughter sounds quite sensible. We'll want to do a thorough assessment to minimize any potential risks. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What does that even mean? I'm eighty-one years old! Things are… creaky. I get tired easily. I used to be strong, a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard work. But that was decades ago. No major illnesses, if that’s what you’re asking. A bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands. And my vision isn't what it used to be. Is that enough details for you? I really don't see what any of this has to do with smoothing out a few wrinkles.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you, Mr. Orwin. It is relevant. We need to understand your baseline health to ensure the procedure—and the recovery—go smoothly. “Creaky” and easily tired are useful descriptions. You mentioned arthritis in your hands. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not constant. It’s worse in the cold, and after I’ve been…using them. Gardening, mostly. My wife used to love her roses. I keep up with them now. But it stiffens up, makes it hard to grip things sometimes. Doesn't stop me, mind you. I'm a practical man. Rub some cream on it and get on with it. Though it does make tying my tie a bit of a struggle these days. Are we almost done here? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, gardening, and some difficulty with fine motor skills due to the arthritis. We'll need to assess your range of motion shortly. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor mentioned something years ago, put me on a pill for a while. Stopped taking it, though. Didn’t feel right. Everything else… no. Never been a sickly man. Just… old. I ate well, worked hard, and didn't bother much with doctors. What’s this all have to do with my face anyway? I want to know if I'm cleared for this or not. Don't need a life story, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s important to determine if that past high blood pressure is still a concern, as it can affect how you respond to anesthesia and healing. Stopping medication without discussing it with your doctor is generally not recommended, but we can assess your current blood pressure now. Do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No! Goodness, no. That was… decades ago. A little white pill. I don't memorize medication names. Honestly, doctor, are you trying to give me a quiz? I came here to see if I'm fit for a face lift, not to relive my medical history from the Carter administration. Just check my blood pressure now and tell me if I can have the surgery or not. I haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Orwin. I don't mean to quiz you, and I understand your impatience. It’s just that knowing your past medical history helps us ensure your safety. Alright, we’ll focus on the present. Let’s take your blood pressure now. Then, I’d like to quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if this takes much longer, I'm leaving. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Not just sitting around letting you poke and prod. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please take a deep breath for me... Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but not drastically so. Breath sounds are a bit diminished bilaterally, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning at this moment. Blood pressure is 142/90. That’s slightly elevated. Now, I'll just take a look at your hands and assess your range of motion. There is some noticeable swelling in the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands, and your grip strength is somewhat diminished. Do you experience any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Pain? A little. Not constant, like I said. It’s more of a…stiffness. And it’s worse when it’s cold. Honestly, doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I've lived a long life, worked hard with these hands. They're not going to be like a young man’s! Does this mean I can't have the surgery? That's what I want to know. Don't tell me about the arthritis. Tell me if I'm cleared or not! This is ridiculous. My daughter is going to hear about this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your impatience and concern. I'm not trying to dismiss your concerns, but it’s my responsibility to thoroughly assess your health to ensure your safety during and after the procedure. Based on the elevated blood pressure and the arthritis in your hands, a facelift does carry some increased risk. The surgery and recovery could exacerbate the arthritis and potentially affect healing. I wouldn't say you are completely unable to have the surgery, but I strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate your blood pressure and a hand specialist to assess your arthritis before proceeding. It's important to optimize your health before undergoing any elective procedure. Would you be open to those referrals?
