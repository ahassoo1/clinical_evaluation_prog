DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... cough, yeah. Been coughing a lot. And tired, always tired. Feels like... sinus also, always block, you know? Like stuffy nose. Been like this... long time already. I forget how long exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. “Long time already” – could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe... six months? Or maybe more? I work, you see. Tire shop. Busy. Don’t really keep track of days. It comes and goes, but mostly it's there, the cough. Sometimes worse, sometimes okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more of intermittent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. That gives us a starting point. When you say "comes and goes," can you describe what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse... when it's cold, I think. And when I’m... lifting heavy tires at work, yeah. Gets worse then. Better... when I rest, a little bit. And... uh... when the weather is hot and dry. Not when it rains. But it never really goes away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, cold weather and exertion at work seem to worsen your symptoms, while rest and hot, dry weather offer some relief, but it's never completely gone. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the cough, such as fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any mucus production when you cough?
PATIENT: Mucus, yeah. Sometimes. Not much, but... greenish. Sometimes clear. Mostly greenish, I think. Fever... not sure. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I don't check. No chills, no pain in chest. Just tired and cough. Sometimes hard to breathe, yeah, when the cough is really bad. Feels like... tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, greenish mucus with your cough, fatigue, and occasional shortness of breath with a tight feeling in your chest. We'll definitely want to investigate that further. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Lung condition... no, I don't think so. Never told by doctor. I go to clinic sometimes for headaches, but they just give me... pills. Asthma… no. My wife, she has asthma, but not me. I work with tires, you see. Lots of dust. Maybe that's why I cough?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. The dust from the tire shop could certainly be a contributing factor. We’ll factor that in. Have you ever had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Major illness... uh... I broke my arm when I was young. Playing. Surgery for that. But nothing else. Just normal… headaches, sometimes. And the cough. Wife said I had high blood pressure once, but I don’t remember. She takes care of all the doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, and a possible history of high blood pressure that your wife manages. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh... just the headache pills. White ones. I buy them from the store. Paracetamol, maybe? I think so. Wife buys them for me. And sometimes I take… uh… cough syrup. Brown bottle. When the cough is really bad. Don't know the name… just cough syrup.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol for headaches and over-the-counter cough syrup as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... no, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes my skin itchy when I touch certain plants at work, but not too bad. Just itchy. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... my father, he had... uh... heart problems, I think. Died when I was young. And my mother… she had diabetes. She’s okay now, but she takes medicine for it. Wife's family... her mother has asthma, like I said. Not much else that I know, really. We don’t talk much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that information with me. Your father with heart problems, your mother with diabetes, and your wife’s mother with asthma. That’s all very helpful. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take your temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just want to stop this cough. It's tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/90. We'll need to monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… I hear some wheezing in your lower lungs, and some crackles as well. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. Finally, I'll check your temperature. Your temperature is normal at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the exam, it appears you may be experiencing bronchitis, possibly with some underlying asthma, and your blood pressure is a bit high. However, we'll need to run some further tests to confirm this and rule out anything more serious. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood test... okay. Sounds good. If you think it will help, do it. Bronchitis... what does that mean? Is it bad? And the asthma... I never knew. My wife will be happy to know. But high blood pressure… is that dangerous?
DOCTOR: Let’s take things one step at a time. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways in your lungs, which causes coughing, often with mucus production, and can cause wheezing and shortness of breath. It’s often caused by a viral infection, but can also be caused by irritants like dust, which, as you mentioned, is present at your workplace. It's usually not dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can sometimes lead to pneumonia. The wheezing I heard suggests the possibility of asthma, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways that makes breathing difficult. It’s often triggered by allergens or irritants. We'll need to do further testing to confirm this, but it's something we can manage effectively with medication. Regarding your blood pressure, 142/90 is considered mildly elevated. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. However, it's very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. We'll discuss these options after we have the results of your tests. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done. Do you have any preferences for where you'd like to have them performed?
PATIENT: Tests... okay. I think the clinic nearby is fine. On Jalan Imbi, you know? Close to my house. I can go tomorrow morning, if that's okay? I need to work, you see. Tires won’t fix themselves. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Jalan Imbi is perfect. I’ll write you a referral for the lab there. They're familiar with our clinic and should be able to accommodate you quickly. Yes, absolutely, I understand you need to work. The lab should be able to get the results back to us within 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse contact you once they're available. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It won't cure the bronchitis, but it should provide some relief from your symptoms. I'll also recommend that you avoid dust and irritants as much as possible, and to stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions about the inhaler, the tests, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Inhaler... okay. How do I use it? And what if the tests show asthma? Will I have to stop working with tires? I don’t know what else I’d do. It’s important work, you see. People need tires.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and a good question. Using the inhaler is quite simple. You’ll take a deep breath, put the inhaler in your mouth, and press down on the canister while slowly inhaling. Hold your breath for about ten seconds, and then exhale slowly. It’s important to rinse your mouth out with water after each use to prevent any irritation. I’ll have the nurse show you again before you leave, and there are also instructional videos online if you'd like. Now, regarding the asthma, if the tests confirm a diagnosis, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to stop working with tires. However, it may require some adjustments. We can work together to develop a plan to manage your asthma effectively so you can continue to work safely. This might include using a mask to protect yourself from dust, taking medication regularly, and monitoring your symptoms closely. We can also discuss whether there are any alternative work arrangements available. The most important thing is to prioritize your health, and to work together to find a solution that allows you to continue working while minimizing your risk of asthma exacerbations. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Mask… yeah, I can wear a mask. So, the tests first, then see what happens. And the nurse will show me the inhaler again. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now. It was worrying, but you explained it nicely. I think that’s all my questions for now. I guess I should go get the tests done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I'm glad I could ease your worries a bit. Yes, getting the tests done is the next step. I'll have the nurse print out the referral and instructions for you. She will also review the inhaler technique with you one last time before you go. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. Do you have any work or school restrictions we need to note for any potential sick leave?
PATIENT: Sick leave... no, I don't think so. I just need to work. My boss, he understands. But long time off, no good. Just need to know what the tests say, then I can plan. Okay?
DOCTOR: Perfect. No restrictions noted. Alright, I'll have the nurse come in and go over the paperwork with you, and show you how to use the inhaler again. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Tati. I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment once the test results are back. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye. .
