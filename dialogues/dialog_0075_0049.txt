DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin' to ya, Doctor. It's... well, it's the ears, I think. They don't work so good anymore. Not like they used to, that's for sure. I'm Betty, by the way. Though folks mostly just call me Schneer. It's a bit of a blur what exactly brought me here today... the lady on the phone, she said somethin' about checkin' 'em?
DOCTOR: Yes, Schneer, that's perfectly alright. And thank you for clarifying – it's good to know what prompted the appointment. So, you've noticed some hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… aye, that sounds right. Things are kinda muffled, y'know? Like talkin' underwater, maybe? It’s hard to make out what people are sayin', especially when there's a bit of noise around. The television's up pretty loud, and my neighbors... well, they complain. Though, I can't always hear 'em complainin', so maybe that's a good thing. It's just… gettin' older, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It can be, Schneer. It's very common with age. And it’s good you’re addressing it. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual over time?
PATIENT: Oh, gradual, definitely gradual. Not like a snap or anything. Seems like it's been gettin' worse… well, for a while now. I can't rightly say when it started, though. Years, I suppose. A good many years. I used to work in a shoe factory, a lot of noise there, clackin' and hummin' all day long. Maybe that had somethin' to do with it? I don't rightly remember when I left the factory, though.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Schneer – prolonged exposure to loud noises can certainly contribute. We'll definitely factor that into things. Now, besides the muffled sounds, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any pain, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, I think so. Like a faint hum, maybe? Or a high-pitched whistle, but only every now and then. Hard to say for sure. I get a bit of a wobble sometimes when I stand up quick, but I just put that down to… well, gettin' old, mostly. No pain, though, no, not in the ears. Just… quiet. Too quiet, maybe? It's hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, occasional ringing, and some dizziness when standing. Thank you for sharing that, Schneer. Now, let's do a quick examination of your ears. I'll just take a look with an otoscope. This won’t hurt a bit. Can you tell me if you have any history of ear infections, or have you ever had any surgery on your ears?
PATIENT: Surgery… ear surgery… goodness. I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I've had a few bumps and bruises in my time, workin' in the factory, but nothin' major. Ear infections… maybe when I was a little fella? A long, long time ago. My mother used to put somethin' warm in my ear… but I can't recall what it was. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see. Sorry I'm not much help with the details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Schneer. Memory can be tricky. Let's just proceed with the examination then. Okay. I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The tympanic membranes look normal, though. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a baseline. It involves putting headphones on and responding to different tones. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Headphones, you say? Aye, I understand. Put somethin' on my ears and listen for noises. Sounds simple enough. Though, I'm not sure I'm very good at hearin' noises these days… but I'll give it a go. Is it gonna be loud? I don't want to startle myself.
DOCTOR: It won’t be loud, Schneer. We'll start very softly and increase the volume gradually. Just let me know when you can hear a tone, and if you can’t hear it at all. It’s quite simple. Okay, I’m going to start now. Please raise your hand when you hear a sound. Let me know if it’s uncomfortable at any point. First ear…
PATIENT: Hmm… nothin'. No, I can't hear a thing. Not a peep. Maybe turn it up a bit, Doctor? Just a little? I don't want to miss nothin', but I really can't hear it. It's just quiet, very quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Schneer. Thank you for your patience. The results indicate you have moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, primarily affecting higher frequencies. This correlates with what you’ve described and the wax buildup we observed. It’s not surprising given your age and history of working in a noisy environment. Now, we have a few options. We can start with wax removal, which might improve your hearing somewhat. We can also discuss the possibility of hearing aids, which would likely provide more significant benefit. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… goodness. I've heard about them. Folks wear 'em, don't they? Seems a bit… drastic. Wax removal sounds alright, though. If gettin' rid of the wax helps, that'd be good. I don't want to go messin' with fancy gadgets if I don't have to. Are they expensive, those hearin' aids? I'm on a fixed income, you see. I just want to be able to hear the television, and maybe understand what folks are sayin' without askin' 'em to repeat themselves all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Schneer. Hearing aids can seem daunting, but they've come a long way. And we certainly don't have to rush into anything. Wax removal is a good first step. It's a relatively simple procedure, and often provides immediate improvement. As for the cost of hearing aids, it can vary depending on the technology and features. Medicare does cover some of the cost of a hearing evaluation and fitting, and we can explore different options to fit your budget. I can also provide you with information about financial assistance programs. Let’s start with the wax removal, and then we can discuss the possibility of hearing aids further if you’re interested. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Wax removal first, see if that helps. Then we’ll talk about… well, those little gadgets. If I need ‘em, I need ‘em, I suppose. You've been very patient with an old fella like me, Doctor. Thank you. When can we get this wax removed, then? And is it… painful? I don't like pain.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Schneer. It's my pleasure. Now, the wax removal is typically a very quick and painless procedure. We can do it right here in the office today. I'll use a special solution to soften the wax, and then gently remove it with a small instrument. It might feel a little bit of pressure or a slight tickling sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. It takes about 15-20 minutes. Would you like to proceed with that now?
PATIENT: Aye, let's get it done then. The sooner the better, I reckon. Fifteen minutes… I can manage fifteen minutes. Just promise me it won’t hurt too much, Doctor. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to things like that. Alright then. Let's get this wax outta my ears.
DOCTOR: Alright, Schneer. We’ll take it slowly. I'll explain each step as I go. First, I'm going to put a few drops of this solution in each ear. It might feel a little bit cool. Just relax and keep your head tilted to the side for a few minutes. Now, we'll let this sit for about five minutes to soften the wax. Is that comfortable?
PATIENT: Aye, that's alright. A bit cool, as you said. Not unpleasant, though. I'm just layin' here, relaxin'… tryin' to, anyway. It's a nice office you have, Doctor. Bright and clean. Helps to keep a fella calm, I reckon. Five minutes, you said? I can manage five minutes. Just let me know when it's time for the wax to come out.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Schneer. I'm glad you find it comfortable. Just a few more minutes. Okay, the wax should be softened now. I’m going to gently irrigate your ears with warm water to flush out the wax. This might feel a little bit strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. How does that feel, Schneer?
PATIENT: It's a bit… strange, you're right. Like water in my ear, which isn't surprising, I suppose. It's not painful, though. A bit ticklish, maybe? And a little bit of pressure. But alright. Not too bad. I can feel somethin' movin' around in there. Is that the wax?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s likely the wax being flushed out. Okay, I think we’ve removed most of the wax. Let me take a look. There’s definitely less wax now, and your ear canals look much clearer. We might need to repeat the procedure in a few days if there’s still some remaining, but for now, this should provide some improvement. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… it does feel different. Not muffled like before. A bit… clearer. Like a weight has been lifted, maybe? I can't say I hear a great deal better, but it's… less quiet. It's a good start, I reckon. Thank you, Doctor. You've done a good job. Now, about them hearin' aids… perhaps we should talk about that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Schneer. I’m glad you’re noticing some improvement. And yes, let's talk about hearing aids. There are many different types and styles available, ranging from discreet in-the-ear models to behind-the-ear options. They all work by amplifying sounds, making it easier to hear conversations, television, and other noises. The best option for you will depend on your specific hearing loss, lifestyle, and preferences. Would you like me to explain some of the different types and features?
PATIENT: Aye, please do, Doctor. Explain it to me like I'm a… well, like I'm an old fella who doesn't understand all that fancy technology. I just want to be able to hear better, that's all. Discreet sounds good, though. Don't want everyone knowin' I'm wearin' somethin' in my ears. And I don't need all the bells and whistles. Just somethin' simple that'll help me hear the television and understand what folks are sayin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Schneer. We can definitely find something simple and discreet. There are two main types we’ll focus on. The first are In-the-Ear models. These are custom-made to fit snugly inside your ear canal. They're relatively easy to insert and remove, and they're fairly discreet, though you will see them if you look closely. The second are Behind-the-Ear models. These sit behind your ear and connect to a small earmold that fits inside your ear canal. They’re a bit more visible, but they often have better battery life and more powerful amplification. Both types come with different features, like volume control and noise reduction. But we can start with a basic model without a lot of bells and whistles. The most important thing is to find something that’s comfortable and meets your needs. We'd need to do a more detailed hearing test to determine the best fit and amplification level for you. Would you be interested in scheduling an appointment for that?
PATIENT: Hmm… those In-the-Ear ones sound alright, though. If they're not too visible, that'd be good. Don't want everyone starin' at me, you see. But what about the cost? Are they expensive? I'm on a fixed income, as I said before. And what about the batteries? Do I have to keep buyin' batteries all the time? That'd add up, wouldn't it? I just want to know all the costs involved before I commit to anything. It's a bit overwhelming, all this technology.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Schneer. It's important to know all the costs upfront. In-the-Ear models are generally a bit more discreet, as you said, and they can range in price from about $1,500 to $3,000 per pair, depending on the features. Medicare does cover a portion of the cost of a hearing test and fitting, and we can help you navigate the paperwork. As for the batteries, In-the-Ear models use disposable batteries, typically size 10, which can last anywhere from 3 to 7 days depending on usage. They’re relatively inexpensive, costing around $10 for a pack of 60. However, there are also rechargeable options available, which eliminate the need for disposable batteries altogether. Those tend to be a bit more expensive upfront, but they can save you money in the long run. We can discuss all the different options and find something that fits your budget and lifestyle. We can also explore some financial assistance programs if needed. Would you like me to schedule a more detailed hearing test to determine the best fit and amplification level for you?
PATIENT: Aye, a more detailed test sounds sensible. See what’s what, I suppose. And get an idea of the cost. If it's gonna cost a fortune, I might have to think about it. But I’m willin' to give it a try. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. Thank you. When can we schedule this test? And will it take long? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Schneer. I’m glad to hear you’re willing to give it a try. We can schedule the test for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. It will take about an hour, which includes the test itself and a discussion of the results. We’ll also take impressions of your ears to custom-fit the hearing aids if you decide to move forward. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, Tuesday at 10:00 AM sounds fine. An hour… I can manage an hour. I suppose I should cancel my bingo game. But I’m willin' to sacrifice bingo for the chance to hear better. You’ve got yourself a deal, Doctor. Thank you again for all your help. Now, is there anything else I need to know before Tuesday? Or am I good to go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Schneer. And that's wonderful to hear! No, there’s nothing else you need to do before Tuesday. Just come in at 10:00 AM, and we’ll get started. And don’t worry about bingo – we’ll do our best to get you hearing better so you can enjoy it even more! It was a pleasure meeting you, Schneer. I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day, and try not to strain yourself cancelling that bingo game!
