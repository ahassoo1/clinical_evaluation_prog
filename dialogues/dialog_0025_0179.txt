DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you too, Doctor… Fourney, is it? It is… the words. They do not come so easy now. It is… difficult finding them. I know what I want to say, but… it feels like they are stuck.
DOCTOR: Stuck, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… a jam, perhaps? Not a painful thing, just… frustrating. It happens more and more often, you see. Especially when I am… trying to explain things. My work… it requires clear speaking. I do compensation… and benefits… and job analysis. Or, did require. It is hard to say now.
DOCTOR: Okay. So this difficulty finding words… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, that is a good question. A long time, I think. It started… slowly. A little forgetfulness, maybe. But it has grown. Perhaps… six months? Or longer. It is difficult to be certain. Things… blur. My wife… she always remembered everything.
DOCTOR: Six months is… significant. And you said it impacts your work?
PATIENT: Yes, very much so. I… used to be very good at explaining the details of insurance plans. Very precise. Now… now I stumble. I have to ask people to repeat themselves. It is embarrassing, Doctor. And… I do not want to be a burden to my colleagues. They are good people.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it's primarily affecting your verbal communication. Are you having any difficulty with writing?
PATIENT: Writing… that is a good question. I do not write as much anymore. Mostly emails, quick things. I believe… I believe I can still write well enough. It is slower, perhaps. And I check it very carefully. Much more carefully than before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the difficulty with words, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, I tire more easily, I think. A little more forgetful than usual, but then… perhaps that is just my age. I am not as quick as I once was. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… lost. Like I am not quite here. But that could be… sadness, perhaps.
DOCTOR: "Lost," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It is difficult to explain. Not lost in a… a frightening way. More like… disconnected. Like I am watching things happen to me, rather than with me. It happens mostly in the evenings, I think. When it is quiet. And… I do not sleep as well as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… I had… the usual things, I suppose. A cold, the flu… high blood pressure, a few years ago. The doctor put me on medication for that. I stopped taking it a while back, though. Felt… unwell on it. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she took care of most of the appointments. I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: You stopped taking your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes. It made me feel… dizzy. And unwell. My wife… she said it was a side effect. She spoke to the doctor, and he said we could try a lower dose. But… before we did, I just… stopped taking it altogether. It was some time ago, I assure you. I felt better without it, though my wife did worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I had a small operation on my knee, a few years back. Just a little arthroscopic thing. Nothing serious. Do you need to know more details, Doctor? I don’t recall much about either one.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother, she had… problems with her memory, towards the end. Not a formal diagnosis, you understand. Just… forgetful. And my father… he was very strong, very healthy. He lived a long life. My wife’s side… they mostly had heart trouble, I think. It is difficult to recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and… there were many of them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I am widowed, as you know. My wife, Elfriede, she passed away two years ago. We… we lived a quiet life. I used to enjoy gardening, and reading. Now… I mostly stay at home. I have a few friends, but I do not see them often. I worked for many years in compensation and benefits. It was a good job, very challenging. Now… I am retired.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I have never had a severe reaction to anything. Perhaps a little sniffle when the pollen is high, but nothing serious. My wife… she was allergic to cats. But I have never been fond of cats, so it was never a problem.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, Doctor. As I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure medication some time ago. And… I don’t take anything else. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. But that is all. My wife… she always managed my medications. I am not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your reflexes, coordination, and blood pressure. It seems you've been a bit… lax about monitoring that last one.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. I… I suppose I have been neglecting things. It is just… difficult, you see. Without my wife… it all feels a bit overwhelming. Please, do what you need to do. I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just follow me. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Now, just relax, and breathe normally… Hmm. 160 over 95. That is quite high. And your pulse is a little fast. Sounds… normal, but definitely elevated. We need to address this, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, let's check your reflexes… Extend your arms, please. A little diminished. And let's see your gait... stand up and walk a few steps. A little unsteady. Overall, your neurological exam is… within normal limits, but there are some concerning signs. Now, let's do a brief cognitive assessment… I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date…? Oh dear. Let me see… it is August… is it the 1st? No… wait. My wife always remembered the dates. Is it the 2nd? I believe it is the 2nd of August, 2025. But I am not certain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Very well. Please, go ahead. I will do my best. It is… sometimes difficult to hold things in my mind, you see.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… …um… chair? No… I… I seem to be forgetting. Apple… table… It’s on the tip of my tongue… I'm sorry, Doctor. I cannot recall the third word.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, your history, and the results of this brief examination, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. Now, I need to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, and I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It is important to get this checked out promptly.
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment…? Is it… serious, Doctor? What does that mean? My wife… she would have known what to do. A neurologist…? It all sounds very… frightening.
DOCTOR: It simply means we need to investigate what's causing your memory and cognitive difficulties, Mr. Gyamfi. It could be a number of things, and it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. A neurologist is a specialist in brain health, and they will be able to perform the necessary tests to determine the cause. It's a standard procedure, and frankly, you need it. I will give you a referral, and I strongly suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I will order a complete blood panel to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential causes. I also want you to start monitoring your blood pressure at home. I will have the nurse show you how. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… My wife always handled these things. What if… what if it is serious, Doctor? What if… I don’t know what I would do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I understand this is unsettling. But worrying won’t help. We need to gather information, and that’s what we’re doing. It’s better to know what we’re dealing with so we can develop a plan. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of your blood work and the neurologist's findings. For now, focus on monitoring your blood pressure and trying to stay calm. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your appointments.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Stop.
