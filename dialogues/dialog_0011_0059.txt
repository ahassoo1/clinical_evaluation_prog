DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my speech. It hasn’t been… quite right, lately. It feels… slurred, sometimes. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. Things have been a bit… busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Busy” can certainly make it difficult to pinpoint when something begins. Could you describe what you mean by “not quite right” and “slurred”?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's like… the words don't always come out clearly. Like I’m trying to say something, but it sounds… muffled, maybe? And sometimes, I stumble over the words a bit. It’s not all the time, though. It comes and goes. I… honestly, it’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Swaby. It’s helpful to hear how you describe it. When you say it comes and goes, could you tell me about the times when it’s most noticeable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It seems worse when I’m tired, definitely. After a long day at the construction site. And… sometimes after I’ve been talking for a while. Like, if I’m chatting with my husband, or giving instructions to the crew… it gets harder as I go on. I don't remember if that was always the case, though. Everything’s a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s very helpful. The fact that it worsens with fatigue or prolonged speech is notable. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… my medical history. Um… well, I don’t… I haven’t really had much of one, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to, but I don’t have any… big illnesses or anything. I think I had the flu once, a few years back. And… I think I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly helpful, Ms. Swaby. It’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And no need to apologize; it’s quite common to not have a detailed medical history readily available. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had any surgeries. Just the arm when I was little, and that wasn’t a… big one, I don’t think. It just needed a cast. I remember my mother being very worried, but… that’s about it. I really don’t have much recollection of it. Do you want me to ask my husband? He might remember more.
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite alright. We can always gather more information later if needed. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – anything like stroke, neurological disorders, or speech problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tough one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and she… well, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he’s still alive, but he’s… getting on in years. He has arthritis, mostly. I don't… I don't really remember anyone in my family having speech problems or… neurological issues. It’s possible, but I honestly can’t say for certain. Everyone kept to themselves a bit. I’m sorry I’m not more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s about it. Definitely no recreational drugs. I work hard, and I need my wits about me, you see. I’m a construction manager, and I have a lot of responsibility.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to stay away from medication if I can help it. Just… a multivitamin now and then, but that’s about it. I prefer to just rest when I’m feeling unwell. I’m not a fan of taking pills, if I can avoid it. I just don’t like the idea of putting things into my body that aren't… food, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Swaby. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions. I can eat anything, thankfully. I do get bitten by mosquitoes a lot, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… annoying. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. My husband might know better, actually. He remembers things better than I do.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Ms. Swaby, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination to assess your speech and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you see. If you think an examination will help, then please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll have a seat here, please. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll check your cranial nerves – that means I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, smile, and assess your reflexes. I’ll also have you say a few sentences and repeat some words to evaluate your speech. Finally, I’ll assess your coordination and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. It all sounds very sensible. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a bit clumsy sometimes, you see. But I’ll do my best. Go ahead whenever you’re ready. I’m trusting you to figure out what’s going on with my speech.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Am I doing alright? It’s a bit hard to keep my head perfectly still, you see. I get a bit dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Ms. Swaby. Just focus on the tip of my finger. Now, could you smile for me, please?
PATIENT: Is that alright, Doctor? It feels a bit… funny, actually. My face feels a bit… stiff on one side. I don’t normally notice it, but now that you’ve asked… it’s a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Swaby. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask you to say a few sentences for me. Can you tell me what day it is today?
PATIENT: Today…? Um… let me think. It’s… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, that’s right. August 2nd. But… it took me a moment to remember, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And my speech feels… a bit slurred, again. I hope you can understand me.
DOCTOR: Could you please repeat after me: “The sky is blue”?
PATIENT: “Theh… skyh… is… bloo.” It’s… hard to say, Doctor. It feels like my tongue is… heavy. And the words just… don’t come out right. I’m sorry, I’m trying my best. Is it very noticeable?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Swaby. It’s helpful for me to hear what you’re experiencing. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Can you hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? They’re a bit shaky, you see. I’ve been doing a lot of heavy lifting at the construction site lately. Perhaps that’s why they’re trembling? It’s hard work, you see. They feel… weak, actually. Especially my left arm.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, I’m going to gently test your reflexes. Please relax your arm. And on this side… Now, I’d like you to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Um… like this, Doctor? It’s a bit hard, you see. My hand doesn’t seem to want to cooperate. And… I almost missed your finger that time. Sorry, it feels like my coordination is… off. Especially on this side.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on what I’ve observed during the examination – the slight asymmetry in your face, the slurred speech, the diminished reflex on your left side, and the difficulty with coordination – I’m concerned about a possible neurological event. While it’s too early to say definitively, these symptoms could be indicative of a stroke or a transient ischemic attack – a TIA. It’s crucial that we investigate this further immediately. I want to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any bleeding or structural abnormalities. We will also need to perform blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: A… a stroke, Doctor? Oh… goodness. I… I don’t… I don’t know what to say. Is it… serious? Will I… will I be alright? I just want to go back to work, and be with my husband. I... What does this mean? Is it something I did? Will I… lose my speech? Will I be able to work again?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel panicked and overwhelmed, Ms. Swaby. It’s good that you’re expressing your concerns. A stroke is a serious condition, but it’s also treatable, especially if caught early. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms to decide the best course of action. The CT scan will give us valuable information. It's possible this could be a TIA, which is often referred to as a “mini-stroke,” and may resolve on its own, but it is still very important to investigate. It’s too early to say definitively what the long-term effects will be. The severity of the stroke, if it is indeed a stroke, will determine the extent of any lasting impairments. We have excellent rehabilitation programs available if needed, and many people do recover well. Regarding whether it’s something you did, it’s often caused by underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. It’s not necessarily something you did or didn’t do. We will do thorough testing to identify any underlying causes. Right now, the most important thing is to get the CT scan and start the diagnostic process. I’m going to page the radiology department to expedite the scan. A nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure and draw some blood samples. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps with you. Do you have anyone you’d like me to call?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Could you call my husband, please? His name is… Marcus Swaby. The number is… 555-123-4567. He needs to know. I… I don’t want to be alone right now. He’ll know what to do. He always does. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… for explaining everything. I’m just… very scared. And… what about work? Will I lose my job? I have responsibilities. I have a crew to manage.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Swaby. Let me speak to Marcus first and explain the situation. I will assure him that we are doing everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms. We will discuss the work situation once we have a better understanding of your condition and the potential long-term effects. “Hello?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Please tell him I’m at the clinic. And… and tell him I think something is wrong with my speech. And… that the doctor wants to run some tests. Please, just tell him to come as quickly as he can. I… I don't want to be alone right now. Just… tell him.
DOCTOR: “Marcus, this is Dr. Neppl from the clinic. I’m speaking with Adyn right now. She came in today with concerns about her speech. She’s experiencing some slurring and difficulty articulating her words. I’ve performed a preliminary examination and, based on my findings, I’m concerned about a possible neurological event. I’m ordering a CT scan and blood tests to determine the cause. I recommend you come to the clinic as soon as possible. Adyn is understandably anxious, and it would be best if you were here to support her. The clinic address is… [clinic address]. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… please hurry. She needs me. And… and I need him. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… for everything. I’m just… so scared. Is it bad? Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It’s natural to be scared, Ms. Swaby. I understand. I want to be honest with you. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s “bad.” We need the results of the CT scan and blood tests to understand what we’re dealing with. But, as I mentioned, we're taking this very seriously, and we're taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause and provide the best possible care. The sooner we have those results, the sooner we can develop a plan. In the meantime, a nurse will be in shortly to check your vital signs and make you as comfortable as possible. Try to relax as much as you can. Focus on your breathing. We’re here to support you every step of the way. I'll be back as soon as I hear from radiology.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… for not dismissing me. And for… for explaining everything. I just… I feel so lost. And scared. Just… let me know when you hear something, please. Anything. I need to know. I just… I need to know. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Swaby. You have my word. I will be back as soon as I have any information. In the meantime, please try to rest. And remember, you’re not alone. We’re here for you. .
