DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a few weeks now, and it’s…well, it’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. A few weeks. Alright. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are we talking?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… kind of in the middle, a little bit to the left of my belly button, I think. It’s not right on my belly button, but that’s the closest I can describe it. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s definitely…there.
DOCTOR: “Kind of in the middle.” Right. And is it a soft lump, or firm?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It feels…firm, I would say. Not rock hard, but definitely not squishy. Like… a tough grape, maybe? I'm not sure if that makes sense. It's not painful to the touch, but pressing on it just…feels solid.
DOCTOR: A “tough grape.” I see. And has the size changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I think it has grown a little bit. Not dramatically, but when I first noticed it, it was… smaller. Maybe the size of a large olive? Now… it’s closer to a small plum, I’d say. I haven't measured it or anything, but that's my best guess. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Well, any new growth is something we need to investigate. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No pain, like I said. No fever, no changes in my bowel habits… no weight loss. I feel… normal, other than noticing the lump. Maybe a little tired lately, but I just figured that’s from work. I’m a choreographer, and we’ve been rehearsing a lot. But no other… noticeable changes, no.
DOCTOR: A choreographer. Interesting. And any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I've been eating normally, and I haven't felt sick at all. Honestly, Doctor, that's why I was a bit hesitant to come in, because everything else feels perfectly fine. But the growth… that just didn't seem right. I figured it was best to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Prudence is always advisable. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, thankfully. No known allergies to any medications. I haven’t had to take much in the past, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, nothing serious. I’m generally healthy, Doctor. It’s just… this lump.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just…regular food, I suppose. I try to eat healthy, but I’m not on any specific diet or anything like that. No vitamins, no supplements… nothing. I really don’t take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been quite lucky, actually. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles… but nothing since. I haven't even broken a bone. I try to stay active, and I guess I’ve just been fortunate to stay healthy. Does that matter, Doctor? The fact that I haven't had any major medical issues before?
DOCTOR: It's…relevant. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had…diabetes, I think. Nothing else that I’m aware of. No history of cancer in the immediate family – grandparents, parents, siblings. My mother’s side is Palestinian, and I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. They haven't lived here long, and communication is…difficult. So, mostly just my parents' health issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a month, but I don’t drink regularly. And definitely no drugs. I’m a dancer, Doctor – I need to keep my body healthy and clear. That’s important for my profession. I hope that helps?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Alright. Now, if you'll excuse me, I’m going to need to examine you. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with palpating your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at any time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie flat, please. Hmm. Yes, I do feel a firm mass, approximately…3 centimeters in diameter. Located slightly to the left of the midline, as you described. It is not particularly tender to the touch. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. It’s not a particularly large mass, but its presence is…concerning. We will need to order some imaging to get a better look.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…serious. What kind of imaging? And what are you thinking it could be, Doctor? I know you haven't examined me properly yet, but… it's just a lot to take in. I’m a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. A lipoma, a hernia, or—less likely, but we cannot rule it out—something more serious. I'm ordering a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. That will give us a much clearer picture. Do not panic. We're being thorough. The scan will determine what we’re dealing with. We also need some blood work, a complete blood count and a metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Okay. A CT scan and blood work… that sounds… comprehensive. I understand you need to be thorough, Doctor. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to do anything special to prepare for the CT scan? I’m a little claustrophobic, by the way… is it a closed machine?
DOCTOR: The CT scan results usually take 24 to 48 hours, depending on the radiologist’s workload. As for the claustrophobia, yes, it is a closed machine, but you can request medication to help you relax. The technician will discuss that option with you. I will also order a referral to a general surgeon for consultation. We will need their input once we have the scan results. It’s best to have a specialist evaluate this. Do you have any questions right now, or shall we proceed with the lab orders?
PATIENT: Okay, a surgeon… that doesn't sound good. But I suppose it’s best to be prepared. Just…what does the surgeon do exactly? Will they automatically want to operate? And… can you tell me a little bit more about what the scan is looking for specifically? It’s just… I like to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: The surgeon will evaluate the mass, based on the scan results. They will determine if intervention—potentially surgery—is necessary. It's premature to discuss that now. The CT scan is looking for size, shape, location, and characteristics of the mass. We need to determine if it’s solid or fluid-filled, if it’s contained within the abdominal wall, or if it’s invading surrounding structures. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Size, shape, location, solid or fluid… and whether it’s invading other structures. It's just…a lot to process. Okay, so I need to get the CT scan and blood work done, and then wait for the results. And then I'll see the surgeon. Is there anything I should avoid doing while I’m waiting? Any activities I should limit? Should I be monitoring anything specifically?
DOCTOR: No, there’s no need to alter your activities at this point. Avoid strenuous exercise for the next 24 hours. Otherwise, just…monitor for any new or worsening symptoms. Fever, pain, nausea, vomiting. If anything changes, contact the office immediately. I have already sent the orders to the lab and imaging center. The receptionist will schedule your appointments. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that's everything for now. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s… a bit worrying. I'll schedule the appointments with the receptionist.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is aware of the situation. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available.
