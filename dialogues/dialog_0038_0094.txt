DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I'm Neeraj Auelua, it's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning. I… think it’s just… the paper said something about learning stuff? My husband, he filled out a lot of things. I don't really remember why I’m here, to be honest. It’s not like anything hurts.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, that happens quite a bit. It sounds like this might have been a general check-up scheduled, but we can certainly figure out what’s going on. Perhaps we can go through a few things to see if anything stands out, even if it’s not a specific pain. To start, are you generally feeling okay?
PATIENT: Okay… feeling okay… I guess so. I work, right? Sheet metal. It’s… hard work. My back gets tired, sometimes. But everyone’s back gets tired, doesn’t it? I don’t… fall apart or anything. I eat, I sleep… mostly. My husband makes sure of that. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It sounds like you’re pretty active with your job. And it’s wonderful to hear you have support at home. Let's talk a little bit more about this tiredness in your back. When does it bother you the most – at work, after work, or all the time?
PATIENT: Ugh, at work, obviously! When you’re bending metal all day, it’s going to get tired. What kind of question is that? It’s not like it’s bad when I'm sitting around, watching TV. That’s… common sense. And my husband gives me… rubs. Sometimes. When I complain enough. Is this going somewhere? I have things to do today, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam, and I apologize if my questions seem obvious. I just need to gather as much detail as possible to understand what’s going on, even with things that seem common sense. We want to make sure there isn’t something more going on than just typical work fatigue. So, when you say 'tired,' can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Describe… It feels tired. Like… heavy. Achy. You know, like when you’ve used your muscles all day. It's not… sharp. It's just… there. Everyone gets aches and pains, Doctor. I don’t need a whole explanation about it. And I told you, my husband rubs it. That usually helps enough. Is this really necessary? I don’t usually complain to… strangers.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, aches and pains are common. And it's perfectly reasonable to not want to spend time discussing things that don't feel urgent. Just to cover all bases, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, or any weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Weakness? No. Why would I be weak? I lift metal all day. I don't… fall down. My husband would be very upset if I fell down. He worries a lot. Honestly, I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing. It's just my back. Everyone's back gets tired. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. It sounds like you’re quite active and generally feeling okay despite some expected fatigue from your work. I understand your feeling that this might be a lot of fuss over nothing. Just to be thorough, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Honestly, I don't even know why I came here. My husband said something about… being sure. He always worries. Just hurry up. I have groceries to buy. And dinner to make. He likes things on time.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick check. Relax your arm for me. It won't take long. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Everything sounds within normal limits so far. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your range of motion in your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Ouch. See? This is why I didn't want to do this. It's sore! Metal, you know? Heavy stuff. I can touch them… sort of. But it’s not… comfortable. I told you, it’s just my back! My husband… he used to be a construction worker, he understands these things. He said it's probably just… strain. Does that sound right? I don't need a fancy examination. I just need to get home.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, and it sounds like your husband has a good understanding of this kind of strain. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and there's some tenderness when I palpate your lower back muscles. It does sound consistent with muscle strain. I'm not finding any red flags that would suggest something more serious, like a nerve issue or fracture. However, because your work is physically demanding, I want to recommend a few things to help manage the pain and prevent it from getting worse. Would you be open to discussing some simple stretches and exercises, and possibly an over-the-counter pain reliever if needed?
PATIENT: Stretches? Exercises? I work all day, Doctor. I don't have time for… exercises! And I don't like taking pills. My husband doesn't like it when I take pills. He says they make me… sleepy. I just want to know if I need to go to the hospital or something? Is this serious? If it's not serious, I want to go home. I have things to do. Dinner. Groceries. He gets upset when things are late. Just tell me straight. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Airam, I understand your frustration, and I want to be very clear. Based on my examination, this does not seem like a serious condition requiring a hospital visit. It sounds like a muscle strain, likely related to the physical demands of your job. However, because you're experiencing discomfort, and your work is so physically intensive, ignoring it could lead to it becoming worse. So, while it’s not an emergency, it’s something we should address. Would you be willing to try some simple over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and I can show you a couple of very easy stretches you can do at home to help loosen up those muscles?
PATIENT: Fine. But easy. And only if my husband says it’s okay. He knows best. Ibuprofen… is that one of those pills that makes you sleepy? And I don't want to spend all day doing… stretches. Just a few. And quick. I have a lot to do. If it doesn’t get better… then what? Will I need to go to the hospital then? Don’t tell me to do anything complicated. He’ll be very angry if I fall down. Just simple. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. Simple is key, and we'll only do what feels comfortable. Ibuprofen usually doesn't cause drowsiness at the recommended dose, but if you experience any side effects, stop taking it and let me know. Here's what I recommend. Take 200-400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. And I'll show you two very gentle stretches you can do a few times a day. These stretches should help loosen up those muscles and improve your range of motion. Try to do them slowly and gently, and stop if you feel any pain. If your pain doesn’t improve after a week, or if it gets worse, then we’ll need to re-evaluate. That might involve some imaging, like an X-ray, to rule out anything more serious. And if you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please come back immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Ibuprofen… stretches. Simple. Don't make me come back. And don’t tell me to do anything complicated. My husband will be very upset if I hurt myself. Can I go now? I really need to get home. Dinner. He likes it on time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's everything written down for you. Please don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. And I hope you feel better soon. Thank you for coming in today, Airam. Have a good evening, and please give my best to your husband.
