DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it's about this…fuss. All this poking and prodding. Honestly, I don’t see what the point is. I’ve lived a long life, you know. A long life. And I’ve always managed just fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a long life doesn't necessarily mean everything is still functioning as it should be, does it?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you start with that nonsense. My feet…they’re feet. They get me where I need to go. Mostly. And that's good enough for me. I don’t need a young woman telling me what’s wrong with them.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I’m not trying to tell you what’s wrong with them. I’m simply trying to understand why you’ve come in today. Is there a specific problem with your feet that’s brought you here?
PATIENT: A problem? No, not really. My daughter, bless her heart, she worries too much. She read something online about…podiatrists, I think it was? And said I needed to get checked. Honestly, it's all a waste of perfectly good time. And Medicare's money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: So, your daughter is the primary reason for this visit. I see. And you haven’t noticed any changes or discomfort in your feet that prompted you to seek medical attention yourself?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Well…sometimes they ache. But everyone’s feet ache when they’re old! It’s just…old age. And I don't go running marathons, if that's what you're asking. I mostly sit. Read. Knit. Perfectly good things to do. Why make a fuss over a little ache?
DOCTOR: I understand. And when would you say these aches started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Years, I suppose. A long time ago. Before…before Harold left. Yes, definitely before Harold left. He always said I had cold feet. A joke, you know. A terrible joke.
DOCTOR: Right. And is the aching constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Like everything else, I suppose. Some days they’re fine. Some days…a bit more bothersome. It’s never enough to stop me from doing things, though. I still manage my garden, you know. Small garden, but lovely. Roses, mostly.
DOCTOR: Roses, that's nice. And when they are bothersome, where exactly do you feel the ache?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. Just…all over. The tops, the bottoms, the sides…you know. Feet are funny things. They’re all bunched up in there. I don't have a map of my feet, young lady.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to pinpoint, then. Now, have you noticed any changes in the appearance of your feet?
PATIENT: Appearance? Well, they're not pretty, if that's what you're asking. They've seen a lot of years. Bumps, maybe. A little…swelling, on occasion. But that's just age, I tell you. And wearing shoes, sometimes. Not all shoes are made for comfortable living, you know.
DOCTOR: Bumps and occasional swelling. Alright. And do these changes…the swelling, the bumps…have they been getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. I don't know about worse. Just…there. Always there, really. I stopped noticing, if that makes sense. It’s like a favorite armchair. You don't notice the wear and tear after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. If you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your feet. Just a brief examination, to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After all this questioning? Honestly, I don’t see what good it will do. But…fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect any miracles. And be gentle, young lady. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be as gentle as possible. Please, sit back and relax. If you could just lift your left foot for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Don't go digging around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently feel around. I do note some mild swelling, and a bit of a bump here, on the side of your foot. This is a bunion, quite common with age. And the skin feels a little bit…cool to the touch. Pulses are present, but a little weak. Anything feel particularly tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there. That’s a bit sore. Always has been, really. My mother had one just like it. Said it was a sign of good breeding. I never did figure that one out. And cool? Well, I am old, you know. My circulation isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Tenderness noted on the first metatarsophalangeal joint, patient reports bunion history. Cool to the touch, likely related to age and circulation. Now, let me just take a look at your other foot.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all rather unnecessary. But go ahead, get it over with. Just be careful. I don't want you breaking anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. The findings are fairly similar on this foot. Some mild swelling, a bunion here as well… and the pulses are also a little weak. Now, have you ever had any problems with numbness or tingling in your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? Hmm. Sometimes, maybe. At night, mostly. I thought it was just…old age creeping in. Or maybe the way I sit. I do like to cross my legs, you know. It's comfortable. But no, nothing terrible. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Intermittent numbness at night, patient attributes to age or sitting position. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it sounds like you may have some mild peripheral neuropathy, likely related to age and possibly some decreased circulation. The bunions are a separate issue, though likely contributing to some discomfort. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Neu-ro-what-y? Honestly, young lady, you’re losing me. All these fancy words. It sounds awful. Is it serious? Am I going to lose my feet? I need my feet, you know. For my garden.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not serious in that way. Peripheral neuropathy simply means there’s some decreased sensation in your feet. It’s common with age, and often manageable. It doesn't mean you're going to lose your feet. Think of it like…a little bit of fading. Your feet still work, they just might not feel everything as strongly as they used to. The decreased circulation could contribute to this, and also to some swelling. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it’s something we should address.
PATIENT: Fading? Like an old photograph? That’s not very reassuring, you know. And what does "address" mean? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I came here because my daughter worried, not because I thought anything was wrong. I just want to get back to my knitting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. And I assure you, I'm not trying to alarm you. "Address" simply means we can try to manage the symptoms. We could start with some simple things. I recommend wearing comfortable, well-fitting shoes, avoiding prolonged pressure on your feet, and checking your feet daily for any cuts or blisters. Also, it's important to keep your blood sugar under control, if that's applicable, and I recommend a referral to a podiatrist for further evaluation and possible orthotics. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ortho-what-ics? More fancy words! And blood sugar? I eat perfectly well! A little chocolate now and then, mind you. But perfectly well. Look, young lady, I'm eighty-three years old. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t need a lot of fuss. Just tell me if I’m going to die or not, and let me get on with my life.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, you are not going to die from this. And I understand you don’t want a lot of fuss. However, even at eighty-three, it’s important to take care of yourself, to maintain your quality of life. The referral to a podiatrist is simply to get their expertise on managing the discomfort and preventing any complications, such as ulcers. I’m not suggesting anything drastic. Just a check-up, and perhaps some inserts for your shoes. Would you be willing to consider that, for your daughter’s peace of mind, if nothing else?
PATIENT: My daughter…always worrying. Fine. Fine, send me to your…podiatrist. But if he tries to put me in those awful sandals, I’m walking right out. And tell him to be gentle! Very gentle. I’m not made of iron, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a podiatrist in town. She’s very good, and I’ll note on the referral that you’d prefer a gentle approach. As for the sandals, I’m sure you can discuss your preferences with her. I’ll also give you a handout on foot care for seniors, with some tips on daily checks and proper footwear. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough fuss for one day. Just get me out of here. And remind your podiatrist to be on time. I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ve made a note of that. I’ll have the nurse escort you to the exit. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. Take care, and enjoy your knitting.
