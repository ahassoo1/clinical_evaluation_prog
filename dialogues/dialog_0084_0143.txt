DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My… someone I care about, she’s thinking about… having a baby. And I thought it was… good to check things first? Before anything happens. I don’t… I don't really know what all needs to be done, honestly. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and get things checked out. So, you’re wanting to ensure you're healthy, should your partner become pregnant?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Me, mostly. I… I want to be sure I am okay. I don't want to… cause any problems. Is that… does that make sense? I’m not… the youngest anymore, you see. And I… well, I haven’t really thought about this in… many years.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It’s very thoughtful of you, and it’s definitely a good idea to get a check-up before starting a family, especially after some time has passed. We’ll want to review your medical history, do a physical exam, and likely some bloodwork. To start, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. That’s… difficult. I’ve seen doctors, of course, over the years. Usual things, colds, flu… broke my arm once, when I was a boy. But… big illnesses? Not really. I… I don’t recall anything serious. I worked as a Sales Engineer for many years, traveling a lot. Didn’t have much time for… being sick, if you know what I mean. Does that help? I’m sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We can work through it. So, no major illnesses like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. I… I don’t think so. Doctor’s always said I was… strong. Healthy enough. I always ate… mostly okay. Not a lot of sweets, I suppose. But traveling… sometimes you eat what you can get. Is there… a list of things I should be thinking about? Maybe that would help me remember. I feel bad I can’t be more… precise.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. It’s common to forget details over time. Let’s see… have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. The broken arm, when I was a child. That was a hospital stay, yes. A few nights. But… after that? No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major. A few times for… stitches, maybe? Little things. Nothing serious enough to… to keep me overnight, I don’t think. I really can't recall. It was a long time ago. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Nothing… cut open, or anything like that. My teeth, maybe? I had some fillings when I was younger, but I wouldn't call that a surgery, would I? No… I’m pretty sure I haven’t had any real surgeries. I’d remember that, wouldn’t I? It’s… a big thing, a surgery.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, fillings aren’t considered surgeries. Okay, good. How about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… tricky. My family is… scattered. I haven’t seen most of them in many years. I know my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He… he passed away when I was young. And my mother… she lived to be quite old, but I don’t remember if she had any… problems. We didn’t really talk about those things. It wasn’t… common, back then. Is knowing about family history… important? I’m sorry, I feel like I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Verrall, but we can work with what you remember. Knowing about heart problems in your father is helpful. It doesn’t mean you’ll have the same issues, but it's good to be aware. Okay. How about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that mean, exactly? Do you mean… what I like to do? I used to enjoy… hiking, when I was younger. And reading. Traveling, of course, with my job. But I don’t… I don’t do much of that anymore. I mostly… stay home now. I don’t drink… much. And I’ve never… smoked. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. That's very helpful. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and you’re generally sedentary now. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat… most things. Sometimes my stomach gets a little upset, but that’s usually from eating too much, or something rich. But no serious allergies, no. I’m pretty lucky, in that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to… let my body handle things on its own. Maybe a pain reliever now and then, for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I'm not a fan of… all those chemicals. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Okay, Mr. Verrall, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. It’s just… been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor. I hope I don’t… make things difficult. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs after this. It'll just take a few moments. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs. That could be due to a number of things, and we'll likely want to get a chest X-ray to get a better look. Finally, I'll just gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I feel a slight enlargement of your liver. Again, we'll need some further testing to determine the cause. Everything else feels normal. Alright, Mr. Verrall, I'm going to order some bloodwork and a chest X-ray. The bloodwork will give us a good overview of your general health, and the X-ray will help us assess your lungs. We'll also do a liver function test to check the enlargement I felt. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… a lot. But alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just… hope it’s not anything serious. All this… testing. It’s a bit overwhelming. Liver, lungs… What does all this mean? I suppose I should just… trust you to figure it out?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Verrall. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’re just being thorough, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re just gathering information. The elevated blood pressure is common, and often manageable with lifestyle changes, or medication if needed. The crackling in your lungs could be a sign of a minor infection, or simply some fluid buildup. And the enlarged liver could be due to a number of factors, including diet, or even some mild inflammation. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and I’ll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your stress levels and eat a healthy diet. I can provide you with some resources on both of those things. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Resources… that would be helpful, yes. Stress… I suppose I am a bit stressed now, thinking about all this. I don’t know… about healthy eating. I used to eat pretty well, I think. But it's hard to keep track of things these days. Um… what about… what about the baby? Is all this… is this going to make it hard to… to have a baby? Is that what you’re thinking?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Verrall. It’s good that you asked. Right now, it’s too early to say whether any of this will affect your ability to have a baby. We need the test results first to get a better understanding of your overall health. However, generally speaking, having good health is important for both partners when trying to conceive. If we find any issues, we can address them with lifestyle changes, medication, or referrals to specialists if needed. Right now, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Let’s focus on getting these tests done and then we’ll have a clearer picture. I'm going to order these tests, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex or… alcohol wipes. Just… get it over with, if you don't mind. I don't like needles much. And… thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. It helps a little, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I understand your apprehension about the needle. It's quick, and the nurse is very good at what she does. I’ll let her know you’re a bit anxious, and she’ll take extra care. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork for the blood draw and to explain the process. Once that's done, you can go home and relax. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please call me, as soon as you know something. I don’t want to be… waiting around. And… thank you again. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I understand your anxiety, and I will definitely call you as soon as the results are in. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
