DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I've been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It's just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all – these things are very common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty initiating urination, and it's taking longer than usual to empty your bladder. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. It feels like I have to… push a little, and then it comes, but it’s not a strong stream, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for maybe a month now, I think. Perhaps a little longer? I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of difficulty starting, needing to strain, and a weaker stream. That gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned you try not to think about it too much – that's understandable! Have you noticed any other changes – like feeling like you haven't completely emptied your bladder, or any urgency, or frequency of needing to go?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes, after I think I'm finished, I'll get up and have to go back a few minutes later. Not every time, but often enough that I noticed it. And… well, I've been getting up at night more too. Maybe once or twice a night. It’s not terrible, but it wasn’t happening before. I don't drink a lot before bed, so I was a bit surprised.
DOCTOR: Okay, so incomplete emptying and needing to get up at night more frequently – that's helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Not at all. It doesn't hurt to go, just… difficult to start and then not feeling quite empty afterwards. It's more frustrating than painful, really. And no fever or chills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, burning, fever, or chills – good to know. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor back home, Dr. Vaitkevicius, always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he kept it under control with a small pill. I take that every morning. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy many years ago, maybe 30 years? Something like that. Everything went well, I don’t think it’s ever bothered me since. Nothing else that I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, managed with medication, and a hysterectomy about 30 years ago. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it in my purse. Ah, here it is. It's Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take it every morning with my breakfast. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, I don't know. A long time. Maybe ten years? More than five, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for approximately ten years. That's very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. The regular kind, nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I'll take an ibuprofen. But not very often, maybe once or twice a month. I try to avoid it if I can. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. And I haven't had any problems with any medicines in the past. Dr. Vaitkevicius always checked, and I’ve never had to worry. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, bladder cancer, kidney disease, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My father… he had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older, I think. He needed dialysis for a while before he passed away. And my brother, he had some sort of cancer, but it wasn’t bladder cancer. Something with his lungs, I believe. My mother was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in her life. Nothing else that I can readily recall, really. It's been a long time, you know. And my family wasn’t much for talking about these things, even when they were sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of kidney issues in your father and cancer in your brother. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. My mother didn’t approve, and I just never got into the habit. And certainly no recreational drugs! I’m a simple woman, Doctor. I enjoy knitting and gardening, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s very good to know. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological exam. Then, I'd like to do a simple urine test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so I'm glad you're being thorough. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I worry a bit about needles, but I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here, and I’ll start with your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back, and relax. I'm going to listen and gently press on your abdomen. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Your bowel sounds are normal. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Now, we'll just need a urine sample. I'll give you a container, and I'll leave you a few minutes of privacy to collect it. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample about halfway through. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds alright. A midstream sample, yes. I think I remember how to do that. It's just… a bit awkward, isn’t it? But I understand why you need it. Thank you for explaining. Just let me know when I'm finished.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It is a little awkward, but it’s an important part of the process. Take your time, and I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy. Alright, the urine test shows no sign of infection, which is good. There’s also no blood in the urine. Your kidney function appears normal, but there is a small amount of protein present. It's not a large amount, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Based on everything we've discussed – your symptoms, your medical history, and the urine test results – it sounds like you may be experiencing an overactive bladder and some incomplete emptying. The small amount of protein in your urine could be contributing to this, or it could be a separate issue. It is possible this is simply a consequence of aging. We can start with some conservative measures, such as timed voiding – that means going to the bathroom on a schedule, even if you don't feel the urge – and bladder training exercises, which help strengthen your bladder muscles. We can also discuss medications to help relax your bladder, if those measures aren’t enough. What are your thoughts on that approach?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I’d rather not take medication if I can avoid it, so I'm happy to try the exercises and the schedule. Timed voiding, yes. It sounds a bit… regimented, but if it helps, I’m willing to give it a try. Bladder training, too. I suppose strengthening the muscles makes sense. Is there anything I need to do now? Any special drinks to avoid, or anything? I don't want to make things worse. And… what if it doesn’t work? Will I need to come back? What happens then?
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Starting with conservative measures is a very sensible approach. As for special drinks, it's best to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Reduce your fluid intake in the evening to minimize nighttime trips to the bathroom, but make sure you are drinking enough fluids throughout the day – about six to eight glasses – to stay hydrated. Regarding what happens if it doesn’t work, we will schedule a follow-up appointment in about four to six weeks to see how you're progressing. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they worsen, we can discuss further testing, such as a urodynamic study, which measures bladder function, or consider medication. We can also refer you to a urologist if needed. To begin, I’ll give you a handout with instructions on timed voiding and bladder exercises. I'll also make a note in your chart to schedule that follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That sounds… comprehensive, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And the handout is a good idea – I forget things easily, so having it in writing will be helpful. Thank you. I feel… a bit less anxious now, if that makes sense. It’s nice to have a plan. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. It's always good to have a plan, and remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you need anything. .
