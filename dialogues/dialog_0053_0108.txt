DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, mind you, but enough to worry a man. Started a couple days ago. Honestly, I haven't been feeling right for a while now, but this... this is new.
DOCTOR: Right. Vomiting blood is… certainly something we need to investigate. A couple of days, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two days now. And it’s not like a fountain, if that makes sense. More like… streaks. Dark, almost black streaks in it. And it smells… different. Metallic, I guess. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know it ain’t right. Been a lot of stress lately, too. Lost my wife last year, and things just haven't been the same.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly manifest in… various ways. The metallic smell does suggest blood, and the dark color is… concerning. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s get a bit more detail. Now, have you noticed any pain associated with the vomiting?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, doc. More like… a burning. A real uncomfortable burning in my chest, right after I… you know. And my stomach feels all twisted up, like a knot. It’s not sharp, it's just… awful. And I get lightheaded pretty easy now, too. Especially after, well, everything. It’s a mess.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning in the chest and a knotted stomach… lightheadedness after these episodes. Have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Food feels like it’s… sticking sometimes. Not with everything, just certain things. Like tougher meats, or anything dry. It’s not a full blockage, I can still get it down, but it feels like I gotta work at it. It's probably nothing, though. I’ve always been a fast eater, maybe it’s just that.
DOCTOR: "Always been a fast eater" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Gentz. We need to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… Well, they’ve been… darker. Much darker than usual. Almost black, like tar. And… look, I don’t mean to be crude, but they smell different too. A real… strong, unpleasant smell. Definitely not normal. I haven't been sleeping well, if that makes a difference. Too much on my mind.
DOCTOR: Black, tarry stools are… significant, Mr. Gentz. And combined with the vomiting blood, chest discomfort, and difficulty swallowing… this is painting a concerning picture. We need to run some tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis. We’ll also need to do an endoscopy to directly visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Do you understand what an endoscopy involves?
PATIENT: An… endo-what-now? Look, doc, you’re throwin’ a lot of fancy words at me. I just know I’m sick. You stickin’ a camera down my throat? Is that what you’re tellin’ me? Because frankly, that sounds awful. And… expensive. I don’t even have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, an endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached to visualize your digestive tract. It’s the most reliable way to determine the cause of your symptoms. I understand your concerns about cost. We can discuss options for financial assistance at the billing office. However, delaying diagnosis could have… serious consequences. We need to find out what’s causing this bleeding. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much in the way of medication since… well, since my wife passed. Maybe a painkiller here and there for a bad back, but nothing regularly. And even then, I just toughed it out. Honestly, doc, I’m not a fan of poking and prodding. This whole thing feels… unnecessary. Is there anything else we can do? A pill? A shot? Something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with respect, "something" isn’t a medical plan. Based on your symptoms – the vomiting blood, dark stools, difficulty swallowing, chest discomfort – and without a clear diagnosis, a pill or a shot would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. We need to rule out serious conditions like ulcers, gastritis, or even something more concerning. I am going to order the endoscopy, and I strongly recommend you allow us to proceed. Do you take any vitamins or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Herbal supplements… Well, old man Youssef, down the street, gave me some stuff… for my stomach. Said it would help with the… discomfort. Some kind of powder, smelled like dirt and spices. Been taking it for a couple of weeks now, maybe a teaspoon a day. Said it was a family recipe, good for all sorts of things. I figured it couldn't hurt. It hasn't helped, exactly, but...
DOCTOR: “Some kind of powder” from “old man Youssef.” That is… concerning, Mr. Gentz. Many herbal supplements can interact with medications or even cause internal bleeding. I need to know exactly what that powder was. Do you still have any of it?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I finished it a couple of days ago. It was just a small bag, really. Didn’t think much of it. He said it was… a blend of Yemeni herbs, passed down through generations. Something about soothing the gut and… restoring balance. Look, I trusted the man, okay? He’s been a healer in this town for years. Everyone goes to him for something. I didn’t think it was going to… this. It's just a powder, doc. A little dirt and spices. Can we just get on with this already? I’ve been sitting here for ages.
DOCTOR: “A little dirt and spices” can be extremely harmful, Mr. Gentz. And your insistence on self-treating with unknown substances is… frankly, baffling. I have ordered the endoscopy, and I will also be consulting with a gastroenterologist. We need a specialist’s opinion on this. I’m going to give you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor to temporarily reduce stomach acid production. It won’t solve the problem, but it may alleviate some of the discomfort. I strongly advise you to refrain from taking any herbal supplements or unregulated remedies going forward. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, whatever. A pill is better than nothin’, I guess. Though I still think this whole thing is a waste of time and money. And what about the endoscopy? What exactly does that involve? I want details, doc. And I mean details. Don’t sugarcoat it. I need to know what I’m getting myself into. And how much this is gonna cost. Stop avoiding the question.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. This form details the endoscopy procedure. You will be sedated, so you won't feel any pain. A thin, flexible tube with a camera will be inserted through your mouth, down your esophagus, into your stomach and duodenum. The gastroenterologist will visually inspect these areas for any abnormalities. Samples may be taken for biopsy. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You will need someone to drive you home, as you will be drowsy. As for cost… I cannot give you a precise figure without knowing the extent of the testing and the specialist’s fees. However, the billing office can provide you with an estimate. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Sedated, huh? So I'll be knocked out? And samples? Biopsies? What if they find something… bad? Look, doc, I'm not a young man. I’ve lived a long life. If it’s somethin' serious… I don't know if I want to know. What are the chances it’s… nothin’? Just a bad stomach? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, while I understand your apprehension, it is irresponsible for me to speculate on the outcome of a test that has not yet been performed. "Something bad" is a vague term. The endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure – it will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The chances of "just a bad stomach" are… difficult to quantify without further investigation. I've scheduled your endoscopy for August 9th. I strongly recommend you attend. I will provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist and contact information for the billing office. Are you prepared to schedule a follow-up appointment for after the procedure?
