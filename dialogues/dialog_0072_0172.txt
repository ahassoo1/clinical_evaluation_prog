DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s a… a social visit, I believe. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Honestly, I don't recall precisely why he felt a doctor's visit was necessary. It’s all rather… disruptive, if you must know.
DOCTOR: A social visit, you say. While I appreciate your husband’s concern for your well-being, it’s rather unusual to schedule an appointment without a specific medical reason. Perhaps we can use this time to do a general check-up, just to ensure everything is as it should be?
PATIENT: A “general check-up”? Honestly, at my age, what good would that do? I assure you, doctor, I’m quite aware of what’s “as it should be” and what isn’t. It's mostly just… things slowing down. It’s perfectly natural. I haven't been ill, if that’s what you’re asking. This is all a waste of perfectly good time, really.
DOCTOR: While I understand your perspective, Ms. Engelhaupt, preventative care is still valuable at any age. Even in the absence of specific illness, a routine assessment can identify potential issues early on, allowing for timely intervention. It also provides an opportunity to discuss any concerns you may have, regardless of how minor they seem. To begin, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. That would take days. Honestly, I’ve lived a long life, doctor. A very long life. There have been bumps and bruises, naturally. A touch of the flu here and there. But nothing… significant. I wouldn’t even know where to begin. It’s all a blur, you see. A very, very long blur. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall details from a long life, Ms. Engelhaupt. We don’t need an exhaustive account. Perhaps we can start with any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had. If you can't recall specifics, that's alright – we can move on. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm. Well, there was that time… oh, decades ago. A broken wrist, I believe. A foolish fall while gardening. My husband insisted I go. He always overreacts. And… was there something else? It’s all so… hazy. Honestly, I think it was just the wrist. A perfectly simple matter. I assure you, I’m not one for… dramatics.
DOCTOR: A broken wrist, decades ago. Alright. And have you had any significant surgeries, beyond the treatment of the broken wrist?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, no. Absolutely not. I’ve always prided myself on my… robustness. I’ve never required anything so… invasive. Honestly, the thought of it! No, definitely no surgeries. I’d remember something like that. It’s quite a… ordeal, I imagine. A perfectly unnecessary ordeal, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness, no. I prefer… natural remedies. A bit of chamomile tea when I’m feeling… unsettled. My husband keeps trying to get me to take something for my… joints, he says. But I refuse. All those chemicals! No, I assure you, doctor, I’m perfectly capable of managing my… well-being without resorting to such… artificial measures. A perfectly sensible approach, if you ask me. .
DOCTOR: No medications, relying on natural remedies. Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
