DOCTOR: Hi Louine, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. Honestly, I don’t know why they bother asking me to explain things. It’s obvious when something hurts, isn’t it? But, alright. It's a sore, and it won’t heal. Been like this for weeks now. A very annoying sore, I must say.
DOCTOR: Yes, it absolutely is obvious when something hurts! And you’re right to get it checked out if it’s not healing. Weeks is a long time for a sore. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me, dear. I am a scientist, you know. I’ve spent a lifetime observing things. But alright, fine. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, just a little red spot, really. Now…well, it’s quite deep. And it smells. Not pleasant, I assure you. I keep it wrapped, but it still…persists. And it’s painful to walk, naturally. I haven’t been able to get to my garden like I used to. Honestly, it’s a terrible inconvenience.
DOCTOR: A scientist! That's wonderful. My apologies, I didn't realize. And a garden is very important, I agree. So, it started as a small red spot on the bottom of your foot, near the toes, and has gotten deeper and is now painful to walk on and has an odor… Have you noticed any drainage from it?
PATIENT: Drainage? Honestly, do you think I’d be enjoying this? Of course, there’s drainage. It’s a sore, isn’t it? It weeps. A bit yellowish, sometimes brownish. And it stains my socks, terribly. I have to throw perfectly good socks away! Really, it's quite wasteful. I keep it covered, as I said, but the bandages don’t seem to help much. It’s…damp. And the smell lingers, even after I change them. Honestly, it's dreadful. You’re asking me to recall unpleasant details.
DOCTOR: You're right, that does sound dreadful, and I apologize for making you recall unpleasant details. It’s good you’re keeping it covered, even if the bandages aren’t fully effective. Yellowish-brownish drainage… Alright. And when did you first notice this sore starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was…after I stubbed my toe, I believe. Yes, that’s it. Last month, sometime. July, definitely. I was walking barefoot in the house – foolish, I know, but the floor was cool – and I bumped into the leg of the coffee table. Didn't think much of it at first. Just a little bruise. But then it started to…well, not heal. And then it got worse. It wasn't a big stub, mind you, but enough to cause trouble, apparently. July the 10th, I’d wager. I remember because that was the day the hibiscus bloomed. I’m very particular about my garden.
DOCTOR: July 10th, after bumping your toe on the coffee table…and you noticed it wasn’t healing. That’s very helpful, thank you. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself since then?
PATIENT: Oh, naturally. I’m not completely helpless, you know. I cleaned it with antiseptic – hydrogen peroxide, mostly. And I put a bandage on it, as I said. And I tried some ointment, a cream my niece gave me for cuts. Some sort of healing balm, with…beeswax, I think? Didn’t seem to do much good. I elevated my foot a few times, but it's difficult to rest when you have things to do. And I've been trying to keep pressure off of it, but it's hard to hobble around all the time. Honestly, it’s a nuisance. I'm starting to think this foot is conspiring against me.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve tried quite a few things already, which is good. Hydrogen peroxide, a healing balm, elevation…Alright. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or redness spreading around the sore?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I don't get fevers. I have a very strong constitution. Chills…well, it gets a bit cool in the house sometimes, but that's just the air conditioning. Redness spreading? Hmm. There's a bit of redness around the edge, yes. Not a lot, but it's definitely not the same color as the rest of my skin. It's…pinkish, I suppose. And the skin around it feels a bit…warm. Not hot, just…not as cool as it should be. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. But I thought I should mention it. You seem very concerned about these details. Are you implying I’ve neglected this?
DOCTOR: Oh, not at all! I’m absolutely not implying you’ve neglected anything. It’s my job to be concerned about details – and you’re right to point things out. Pinkish redness and warmth around the sore are good things to know. Now, do you have diabetes, or any other medical conditions that affect your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh. That. Well, yes. I do. Type 2, the doctor told me. Years ago now. I try to manage it with diet, mostly. Not much sugar, you know. And I take pills, occasionally. When I remember. Honestly, it’s not something I dwell on. And I’ve always had poor circulation in my feet, even before the diabetes. My ankles swell sometimes, especially in the summer. It’s just…part of getting old, I suppose. And truthfully, I don’t always listen to the doctors. They’re always telling me what I can’t do. Honestly, I find them rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for telling me. Diabetes and poor circulation are important to know. It sounds like you've been managing things for a while. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot if that's alright. Can you please sit back and elevate it onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't see why you need to look at it. I’ve already told you everything. But alright, fine. If you insist. It's just…I don't like anyone touching my feet. They’re very sensitive, you know. Be gentle. And don't poke.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. And no poking, I promise. I just need to get a good look and assess the situation. Alright. The sore is located on the bottom of your foot, near your toes, and it appears to be quite deep. There is redness and warmth surrounding it, and it is tender to the touch. Your pulses are present, but they are a bit weak. I also notice some dryness and scaling on the skin of your foot. It appears there is some loss of protective sensation. This is concerning.
PATIENT: Loss of protective sensation? What does that mean? Are you saying I can’t feel my foot properly? Honestly, this is dreadful. Is it serious? Is it going to have to be…amputated? My niece, Beatrice, had a friend who lost a toe to diabetes. It was awful. She was in terrible pain for months afterwards. Are you saying this is as bad as that? Honestly, you’re frightening me. And all this touching! I knew I shouldn't have let you near my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I apologize for frightening you. Let me explain. “Loss of protective sensation” means that you might not be able to feel pain or temperature changes in your foot as well as you used to. This is a common complication of diabetes, and it can make it easier to develop sores that don’t heal. And no, I am absolutely not saying this is as bad as that, or that you are going to need an amputation. That is a very extreme outcome, and we are nowhere near that point. But because of the diabetes and the loss of sensation, this sore needs to be treated very carefully to prevent infection and ensure it heals properly. I would like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. Based on the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An X-ray? Honestly, this is becoming quite an ordeal. I came in about a sore, and now you want to poke and prod and take all sorts of samples. It's…excessive. And expensive, I presume? My Medicare…well, it doesn’t cover everything, you know. But alright, fine. If you insist. But I want everything explained to me, thoroughly. And I want to know how much it's going to cost. And I want it to be over quickly. I don't have all day. And please, no more touching. Honestly, this is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand your concerns. We’ll explain everything in detail before we do anything. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and check for any signs of infection. The X-ray will allow us to see if the infection has spread to the bone. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples now, and then we’ll get the X-ray done. I’ll also discuss the costs with you, and we can review what Medicare will cover. The nurse will be in shortly. And I promise, no more unnecessary touching. I just need to make sure we get a clear picture of what’s going on so we can get this sore healed properly. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Well…will it hurt? The blood tests, I mean. I don’t like needles. And will I be able to walk afterwards? I have a gardening club meeting tomorrow, and I promised to bring hibiscus cuttings. It would be dreadful to miss it. And is there anything I can do? Besides sit here and wait for you to poke and prod? Honestly, I’m a scientist, you know. I like to be proactive. Perhaps I can clean the sore myself more frequently? Or…something?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. The blood test will be a quick pinch, and it shouldn't hurt for very long. It’s usually over before you know it. You'll be able to walk afterwards, though it might be a little uncomfortable. You should be fine for your gardening club meeting tomorrow. And absolutely, there are things you can do. Keeping the sore clean and dry is very important. I recommend gently washing it with mild soap and water once a day, and then patting it dry carefully. I also advise avoiding putting any creams or ointments on it unless I specifically tell you to. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests and X-ray done, and then we can develop a comprehensive plan to get this sore healed. It's wonderful that you want to be proactive. It's good to be informed and involved in your care. The nurse should be here any minute now. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm…I don’t think so. I’ve never had any problems with gloves or anything. But my skin is rather sensitive, as I mentioned. I react easily to certain soaps and lotions. It gets quite red and itchy. Perhaps you should use a gentle cleanser when you…examine my foot. If you absolutely must. Honestly, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. But alright, proceed. Just be careful. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be very careful, and we’ll use a gentle, hypoallergenic cleanser. I'll also make sure to wear gloves. I understand your apprehension, and we’ll go at your pace. Nurse, could you come in and draw Louine’s blood, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, the fuss. A simple sore… Fine. Let's get it over with. But if I faint, I expect you to catch me. I’m not as young as I used to be. And I want a hibiscus cutting for my trouble. It's only fair.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I’ll catch you if you need me, and a hibiscus cutting is absolutely fair. It’s the least I can do. Here's the nurse, Louine. She's very skilled and gentle. She’ll just need a small sample of blood for the tests.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And be quick about it. I have a garden to tend. Honestly, the indignity of it all. .
