DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… delicate, really. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things… progress. One simply doesn’t want to be caught unawares, does one?
DOCTOR: Prudent, yes. A sensible approach, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, one would expect a certain… awareness. Nevertheless. Let's begin with a detailed history. When you say 'progress,' can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we be so blunt? It means… intimacy. Physical closeness. And frankly, I’d prefer not to delve into the particulars with a… a professional, if you understand my meaning. I simply want to ensure I’m… fit for it. Is that too much to ask? I've always been quite healthy, you know. Regular check-ups and all.
DOCTOR: Very well. “Fit for it.” We’ll ascertain that. Though a complete medical history is still required, regardless of… discretion. Let’s start with your past medical history. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? Really, Doctor. I’ve had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, nothing a sensible mother couldn't handle. And a bout of the flu a few years back, but that barely counts. I assure you, I am not a fragile woman. I’ve always been remarkably robust. Though… my mother did have high blood pressure, if that’s relevant. It ran in the family, you see.
DOCTOR: Measles, mumps… acceptable. And your mother's hypertension is noted. Family history is pertinent. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, naturally. And… a rather unpleasant bunion operation some years ago. It was a nuisance, really. All the fuss. But thankfully, it was quite successful. No lingering problems, I assure you. Though the recovery was terribly boring.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, bunionectomy… noted. Any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm not one of those delicate types who reacts to everything. Though… I do find certain perfumes give me a headache. Especially those overly floral ones. Dreadfully common, these days. But an allergy? No. I eat everything, take everything. I'm quite… adaptable, you see. It's a useful trait.
DOCTOR: Adaptable is… good. However, perfume sensitivities are noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Do I look like the sort of person who relies on medications? I maintain my health through sensible living, proper diet, and a bit of exercise. No, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing. I find relying on pills is simply… uncouth. And often unnecessary. One should be able to manage things oneself, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Very well. No current medications. Let's move on to a physical examination then. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Pandolfi, even for those who pride themselves on “sensible living.” Please step up onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Oh. That. Must we? I mean, surely my general demeanor is indicative enough of good health. Is a number truly necessary, Doctor? It's terribly… vulgar, you know. But if you insist…
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 1.66 meters. That places your BMI at 33.9, classifying you as obese. Now, please step onto the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s all quite routine, Ms. Pandolfi. Try to relax. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Obese? Really, Doctor. That's rather… strong language. I'm… generously proportioned, perhaps. A womanly figure, one might say. But obese? I assure you, I'm perfectly comfortable in my own skin. And I find this examination rather… intrusive, if I may say so. But proceed, I suppose. Though do try to be gentle.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal, albeit slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though breathing is somewhat labored. Now, I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… rather firm, Doctor. And yes, a little… sensitive, actually. It’s probably nothing. I had a rather… robust appetite during the holidays, you see. Perhaps it’s just a bit of… fullness. But please, do be careful. It’s quite tender around… here.
DOCTOR: Tenderness is significant, Ms. Pandolfi. And the fullness you describe, combined with your BMI… I’m going to need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a glucose test. We also need to rule out any underlying gynecological issues. I’ll also need a urine sample. This is standard procedure, given your… condition.
PATIENT: Gynecological issues? Doctor, are you implying… I assure you, my personal life is perfectly… regulated. This is all rather unnecessary, don't you think? Blood work, glucose tests… it all seems rather extreme. Is this truly necessary, given that I simply wanted a check-up before… progressing? I came here for reassurance, not a complete medical overhaul.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, “progressing” – as you put it – can exacerbate underlying health conditions. Your BMI places you at risk for a number of complications. It's my professional responsibility to ensure your well-being, and that requires a thorough evaluation. The blood work and urine sample are not optional. Furthermore, a pelvic exam is necessary to rule out any potential issues that could impact your… activities. I understand your discomfort, but this is for your own safety. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect the urine sample. Then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for the pelvic exam and to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Doctor, I am… appalled. Absolutely appalled. I came here seeking a simple medical opinion, and I am being subjected to… an inquisition. I think I’ve heard enough. I will be seeking a second opinion, from a physician who understands… discretion. Good day.
