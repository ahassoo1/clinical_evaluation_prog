DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble, you see. Going to the toilet isn’t as easy as it used to be. It takes me a while to start, and then…well, it's not a strong stream, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination. That can be really frustrating. Let's talk a little more about that. First, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been…let me think. It started maybe three months ago, I’d say? At first, I didn’t think much of it, just old age, you know? But it hasn’t gotten better, and now it’s starting to bother me more and more. I find myself having to go more often, even if I don't need to, just to be sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it's been about three months, and you've noticed both difficulty starting and a weaker stream, and an increased frequency, even when you don't have a strong urge. Okay. And when you do feel like you need to go, do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no pain or burning. It’s not uncomfortable, exactly, just…effortful. Like I have to push a little more than I used to. And sometimes, after I finish, it doesn’t feel like I’ve emptied my bladder completely, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left in there. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound strange at all. It's good to know there's no pain or burning, that rules out a few things. And feeling like you haven't fully emptied your bladder is definitely something we need to investigate. Okay, let's move on to some other questions, just to get a better picture. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine? Hmm…let me think. I haven’t noticed any blood, definitely. It looks normal, I suppose. Maybe a bit darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it. I haven’t noticed any smell either, not that I’ve checked particularly, but nothing stands out. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Darker urine could be from the tea, as you said. And you're right to be mindful of changes in color or smell – those can be important clues. Alright, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me see. I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been managed with a little pill every day. Nothing else, really. My knees aren’t what they used to be, but that’s just old age, I think. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, but that was no trouble. Do you need a list? I’m quite organized, you know. I keep everything in a folder.
DOCTOR: That's good that your blood pressure is managed. And no need for a list right now, unless you prefer. Knowing about the gallbladder removal is helpful, thank you. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, yes. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. One every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really acting up, I take a little bit of ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. I don't like taking too many pills, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, children—had any problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… that’s a good question. My mother… she had a bit of a weak bladder when she got older, I remember that. Always rushing to the toilet! But I don’t think she ever saw a doctor about it. My father was healthy as an ox, never a day’s illness in his life. And I don’t have any siblings, and never had children, so…I suppose just my mother, then. But it wasn’t a serious thing, just a bit of an annoyance.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. A family history of bladder issues is helpful to be aware of. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I don't smoke. Never have. My husband… well, he smoked for a while, but he passed away a long time ago. And I don’t drink alcohol either, not really. Maybe a little glass of wine with Christmas dinner, but that’s about it. I prefer tea, as I mentioned. Lots and lots of tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. No smoking or regular alcohol use. Lots of tea, noted. Alright, Kandy, that gives me a pretty good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your abdomen and do a simple neurological exam. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Physical exam is fine. I haven’t had one in…well, I can’t even remember when! I just hope it doesn’t involve anything…uncomfortable. I'm a bit sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It won't be uncomfortable at all. Mostly just listening and feeling. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, let’s start with your abdomen. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Any pain anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of pressure, but no pain. It feels…normal, I think. Like you said, just pressure. I’ve had a bit of a tummy, you see, all my life. But no sharp pain or anything like that. It feels…familiar, if that makes sense. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. "Familiar" is good. No sharp pain is good. I’m just checking the size and shape of your bladder. It doesn't feel significantly enlarged at this point, but it’s a bit difficult to tell definitively without further testing. Now, I just want to check your reflexes. This is just to make sure the nerves that control your bladder are functioning properly. Could you sit on the edge of the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Nerves, you say? I hope everything’s alright with my nerves. I’m a bit wobbly, you see. Old age, again. Do I just sit here? What do I need to do? I always worry I’ll do something wrong.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine! You don't need to worry at all. Just relax. I’m just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It’s a very quick tap, and it just checks your reflexes. This is completely normal. Okay. Your reflexes are present, but a little bit diminished, which can be common with age. It’s not a cause for immediate concern, but we’ll take that into consideration. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Everything looks generally okay, but based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I’d like to order a couple of tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. Tests, you say? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I don’t really like going to the hospital, but I trust your judgement. What kind of tests are we talking about? Will they be…uncomfortable? I do have a low pain threshold, you see. And will they take long? I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. We'll keep everything as comfortable as possible. The first test I'd like to order is a urinalysis – a simple urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities. That's very straightforward, and you can do that at the clinic. The second test is a post-void residual volume – this measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. It's a non-invasive test done with an ultrasound. It won't be uncomfortable at all, just a little cool gel on your abdomen. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Do those sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…much better than I expected, actually. A simple urine sample, I can manage that! And the ultrasound…no needles, you say? Just gel? Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable. And it won’t take too long, you said? I wouldn't want to miss my bridge club! Thursday is my best day, you see. So, how do we go about doing these tests? Do I need to make an appointment? Or can I do them right away?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad they sound manageable. No needles at all, just gel for the ultrasound. Yes, we can get these scheduled for you right away. The nurse can collect a urine sample for the urinalysis now, and we can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow afternoon. That would give the lab time to process the urine sample and the radiologist time to review the ultrasound. Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon sounds fine, yes. As long as it doesn’t clash with my…well, I do have a bit of a commitment tomorrow, but I think I can reschedule it. What time are we talking about? And will I need to do anything special to prepare for the ultrasound? Like drink lots of water or…empty my bladder beforehand? I always worry about these things, you see. I’m a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… we have an opening at 2:00 PM tomorrow. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: 2:00 PM sounds perfect! Yes, that gives me plenty of time to…well, I usually have a little nap after lunch, but I can skip it if I have to. And you said something about emptying my bladder beforehand? Should I drink lots of water before the test, or…not drink anything at all? I don’t want to mess anything up. I always worry about following instructions correctly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine – skip the nap if you need to! And no need to worry about following instructions – you’re doing great! For the ultrasound, we actually want you to drink a normal amount of water beforehand – not too much, not too little. Just what you’d normally drink. And do empty your bladder about 30 minutes before the appointment. That’s the most important thing. So, just to recap: urine sample today, ultrasound tomorrow at 2:00 PM, drink a normal amount of water, and empty your bladder 30 minutes beforehand. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly clear! Urine sample today, ultrasound tomorrow at 2:00 PM, drink normally, empty bladder 30 minutes before. I think I can remember that. Just to be safe, you see. I'm a bit forgetful sometimes, even though I do have a good memory for details, it's the simple things I forget! Oh, and thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I always worry about bothering doctors with all my questions, but you explained everything so nicely. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. That's what I'm here for! Please don't hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way, even if they seem small. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or questions I can address before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what needs to be done. I’ll see you tomorrow, then!
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you, Kandy. We’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00 PM. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. Have a good afternoon!
