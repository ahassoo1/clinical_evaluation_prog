DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Al Corta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…adequate to meet you as well, I suppose. I’m here regarding my vision. It’s been…declining. Not suddenly, mind you, but gradually. It's becoming quite inconvenient, truthfully. I find myself needing things…closer to my face to read, and even then, it’s not as crisp as it once was.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Al Corta. It sounds like you're experiencing a progressive difficulty with your vision, specifically with near sight. “Declining” and needing things closer to read are certainly things we want to investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately how long you’ve been noticing this change?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. I don't precisely keep track of such things. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t something that happened overnight, certainly. More of a… creeping realization, if that makes sense. I suppose I ignored it for a while, hoping it would resolve itself. One doesn’t typically rush to the doctor for… normal aging, does one?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to delay seeking medical attention for gradual changes. Six months is a helpful starting point. And you are right, many changes do occur with age, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. When you say “not as crisp,” can you describe that further?
PATIENT: Well… it's as if looking through a slightly…smudged window. Things aren’t blurry, exactly. More…faded. The edges aren't as defined. Details are…lost. For instance, reading the newspaper—the print doesn’t seem as sharp as it used to be. It requires more…effort, shall we say, to focus. It's irritating, really. I used to be able to scan an article and absorb it quickly. Now… it’s a chore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Al Corta. "Smudged window" and "faded edges" are very helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with visual acuity and perhaps some loss of detail. Now, has this vision change been affecting other activities besides reading?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. Driving, for one. Not at night, thankfully—I avoid that whenever possible. But during the day, judging distances is…more challenging. And recognizing faces—particularly from a distance—is becoming harder. I recently mistook a neighbor for someone else entirely. Most embarrassing, really. It’s not a matter of not seeing them, it’s more… a difficulty in identifying who they are. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s affecting both near and distance vision, and causing some issues with facial recognition as well. That’s important information. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses currently?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I always prided myself on having excellent eyesight. Always top row on the eye chart, you see. It’s…disconcerting to think it’s finally failing me. It feels… unnatural, if you will. A bit of a blow to the ego, to be honest. I always considered it a…gift, having such clear vision. Now… well, now it appears to be a diminishing asset.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be frustrating, especially having relied on good vision for so long. It’s not uncommon for vision to change as we age, even for those who haven't needed corrective lenses previously. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. I've always been remarkably healthy, thank you very much. A bit…thin, perhaps. My weight has always been…a challenge. But no significant illnesses. I used to be quite active, hiking and the like. Though, admittedly, that's slowed down considerably in recent years. I attribute that more to… a lack of motivation than any physical ailment. My father had some heart trouble, eventually, but I don’t believe I’ve inherited that predisposition. I’ve always taken good care of myself, generally.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Being generally healthy is certainly a positive. And thank you for mentioning your father’s heart trouble; we'll keep that in mind. You mentioned you're a bit thin. Approximately, what is your current weight and height?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Must you discuss my physique? Very well. I'm… approximately 133 pounds. And I stand six feet tall. Yes, six feet even. I’ve always been…slenderly built, shall we say. It’s a family trait, mostly. My mother was quite petite herself. It's not a matter of unhealthy habits, I assure you. I simply… don’t have a large appetite. It's always been that way. It's rather inconvenient, actually. Maintaining energy levels can be…challenging.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Al Corta. 133 pounds and six feet tall gives us a BMI of approximately 18.5, which is considered underweight. We'll want to consider that in the context of your vision changes. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not a single one. I’ve always been… exceptionally fortunate in that regard. A few minor ailments, of course—the occasional cold, a bout of the flu—but nothing requiring…intervention. I’ve always prided myself on avoiding doctors whenever possible. Which, I suppose, is rather ironic, considering I’m here now. But this…this vision issue is rather persistent, wouldn’t you agree? It’s not something one can simply…ignore.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, it is persistent, and good on you for addressing it. No surgeries or hospitalizations is excellent. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of vision problems – such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataracts – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother's side of the family... they weren't particularly forthcoming about such things. A rather… reserved bunch, you see. I believe my grandmother had some… difficulty seeing later in life, but it wasn’t discussed openly. They weren't ones for sharing personal ailments. My father's side… he had a brother who wore glasses, I believe, but beyond that, I don’t recall any significant vision problems. It’s possible there were instances I’m unaware of. They weren’t ones for detailed medical records, shall we say. It's a bit of a… hazy recollection, truthfully. A bit of a… family secret, perhaps. They didn't discuss such things openly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you recall. It's not uncommon for family medical history to be incomplete. We'll proceed with that in mind. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I find such habits… deplorable. A complete lack of self-discipline, if you ask me. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and my alcohol consumption is…negligible. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion—a very rare occasion, mind you—but nothing beyond that. And recreational drugs? The very thought is…repulsive. I maintain a rather… disciplined lifestyle, generally. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book—or, rather, used to prefer a quiet evening with a good book—to… such excesses. It's a matter of personal principle, you see. Maintaining one’s health is paramount.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear. A healthy lifestyle is certainly beneficial. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard as well. I can tolerate most foods without issue, and I’ve never experienced any adverse reactions to medications. I’ve always been rather… cautious about what I ingest, generally. One doesn't want to introduce unnecessary complications, you see. It's a matter of… prudence, I suppose. A healthy constitution, generally. Though, I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of shellfish. But that’s a matter of taste, not allergy. A rather… peculiar texture, if you ask me. It's more of a… personal aversion than a medical concern.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Al Corta. No known allergies is good. So, to summarize, you’re a 52-year-old male with a gradual decline in near and distance vision, no significant medical history, no surgeries, a possible family history of vision problems, no unhealthy habits, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to perform a brief eye exam to assess your vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… acceptable, I suppose. Though I confess, I’ve always been rather… apprehensive about such examinations. The bright lights, the strange instruments… It’s all rather unsettling, frankly. But I understand it’s necessary, given the circumstances. Proceed, I suppose. But please, be gentle. And try to explain what you’re doing, if you wouldn’t mind. One doesn’t want to be… taken by surprise.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Al Corta. I understand your apprehension, and I’ll explain everything as we go. We’ll start with a visual acuity test. I’m going to have you read letters on a chart, starting with larger ones and getting smaller. It’s very straightforward. Just read the smallest line you can comfortably see. First, can you cover your left eye with your hand?
PATIENT: Very well. Though this is… rather awkward, isn't it? I'm hardly accustomed to blocking out perfectly good vision. Proceed, I suppose. I'm… prepared to be disappointed, I suspect. It's rather disheartening to think my eyesight is failing me. It was, after all, one of my… finer attributes. Is this… is this the Snellen chart, by chance? I recall something about that from… somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the Snellen chart. And you're quite right to recognize it. Now, just read the letters starting with the top row, and continue as far down as you can comfortably see. Don’t strain your eyes; just tell me when the letters become blurry or indistinct. Okay, starting with the top line…
PATIENT: Right… U… V… J… T… Oh… that one is… difficult. P… Z… The next line… Oh, dear. That one is… considerably more challenging. I can make out… F… H… but the others are… indistinct. Rather smudged, actually. Like looking through… a dirty windowpane, as I mentioned earlier. I can see something, but not with any clarity. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. Is this… is this a sign of something serious?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Al Corta. That’s very helpful. Based on that, your visual acuity in your right eye is approximately 20/70. Now, let’s test your left eye. Please cover your right eye. And again, just read the letters starting with the top row and tell me when they become blurry.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I confess, this is… rather unsettling. It feels… rather strange, relying on only one eye. And already, I suspect the results will be… less than favorable. As I mentioned, my vision has been… deteriorating gradually. Oh… this is… even more indistinct than the other eye, I fear. I can make out the top few letters… E… F… but beyond that… it’s simply a blur. Like looking through… fog, perhaps. A rather… disheartening experience, to be honest. Is there… anything that can be done? Is this… irreversible?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Al Corta. Based on that, your visual acuity in your left eye is approximately 20/100. Now, I’m going to shine a light in your eyes and check your pupils’ reaction. This won’t be uncomfortable, just look straight ahead. Looking straight ahead… excellent. Now, I’m going to check the movement of your eyes. Follow my finger with your eyes, but keep your head still. Follow my finger… good. Now, I’m going to use a small instrument to check your peripheral vision. Just focus on the center point and tell me when you can see something in your side vision. Focus on this point… and tell me when you see my finger…
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must confess, this is… rather disconcerting. It feels… rather intrusive, I suppose. And I'm not particularly fond of having bright lights shone in my eyes. It's… unsettling, to say the least. And I'm not entirely certain I'm following your instructions correctly. It's… difficult to concentrate, frankly. And my peripheral vision… it feels… rather limited, actually. I'm not entirely certain when I'm seeing your finger, and when I'm simply… guessing. Is this… is this normal? Is this… a cause for concern? I confess, I'm growing increasingly anxious. Perhaps I should have simply… resigned myself to accepting my fate. It's not as if I have much to lose, after all. A quiet evening with a good book… that was always enough. Though even that is… becoming increasingly difficult. What… what are your preliminary findings? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Al Corta, that’s enough for now. You’re doing very well, and I appreciate your patience. I understand you’re feeling anxious, and I want to assure you we'll figure this out together. Based on the initial examination, your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. The pupillary and extraocular movement tests were normal, which is good. However, your peripheral vision is somewhat limited. These findings suggest a possible need for further investigation. It could be due to a number of factors, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, or other conditions. I don’t want to jump to conclusions without further testing. I’d like to order a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They will perform specialized tests to determine the exact cause of your vision loss. I’ll also order a visual field test, which will assess your peripheral vision in more detail. It’s important to remember that many vision problems are treatable, even if they can’t be completely cured. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Glaucoma? Cataracts? Those… those sound rather ominous, don’t they? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of specialized tests. The thought of… further intrusions is rather unsettling. And “treatable” doesn’t necessarily equate to “curable,” does it? What… what are the implications of these conditions? Will I… will I go blind? Is that… a possibility? I confess, the thought is… rather terrifying. A quiet evening with a good book… that is all I ask. To be deprived of even that… it’s… unthinkable. And who… who is this ophthalmologist? Are they… reputable? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of entrusting my eyesight to… strangers. And what… what will these tests entail? Will they be… painful? I confess, I’m growing increasingly anxious. Perhaps I should have simply… resigned myself to accepting my fate. It's not as if I have much to lose, after all. Though even that… is becoming increasingly difficult. What… what are my options? Is there… anything I can do to… slow down the progression? I confess, I’m growing increasingly desperate.
DOCTOR: Mr. Al Corta, I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed by this information. Let’s take things one step at a time. First, let me assure you that going blind is not necessarily the outcome. Many people with macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataracts maintain useful vision with treatment. We’re simply gathering information to determine the best course of action for you. Macular degeneration affects central vision, making it difficult to read and see fine details. Glaucoma affects peripheral vision. Cataracts cause clouding of the lens, resulting in blurred vision. The tests the ophthalmologist will perform are not painful. They may involve dilating your pupils with eye drops, which can cause temporary blurry vision and sensitivity to light. They may also involve taking images of your retina and measuring the pressure in your eye. These tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis. Treatment options vary depending on the specific condition. They may include eye drops, laser therapy, injections, or surgery. I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance at the Coastal Eye Center. She is a highly respected ophthalmologist with extensive experience in treating these conditions. I’ll provide you with her contact information and a referral form. While we can’t always prevent vision loss, certain lifestyle factors can help slow the progression of these conditions. These include wearing sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays, maintaining a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking. I understand this is a lot to take in. I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance, you say? I… suppose that’s… acceptable. Though I confess, I'm not particularly fond of entrusting my eyesight to… specialists. It feels… rather impersonal, doesn't it? And these… lifestyle factors. Wearing sunglasses? Maintaining a healthy diet? I’ve never been particularly… disciplined in such matters. It feels… rather futile, doesn't it? To think that such… minor adjustments can make a difference. What… what are the chances of… successful treatment? Is there… any hope of… reversing the damage? I confess, the thought of… permanent vision loss is… rather terrifying. A quiet evening with a good book… that is all I ask. To be deprived of even that… it’s… unthinkable. And what… what if… if the tests reveal… something… more serious? Is there… any possibility of… complete blindness? I confess, the thought is… unbearable. Perhaps I should have simply… resigned myself to accepting my fate. It's not as if I have much to lose, after all. Though even that… is becoming increasingly difficult. And what… what are the costs involved? I confess, I'm not particularly… well-off. Perhaps… perhaps I should simply… give up. It's not as if… it's not as if I have much to lose, after all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Al Corta, I understand your fears and anxieties, and it's completely natural to feel overwhelmed. You're not alone in feeling this way. The chances of successful treatment vary depending on the specific condition and how early it’s diagnosed. For some conditions, treatment can significantly slow the progression of vision loss and even improve vision. For others, treatment can help maintain existing vision and prevent further deterioration. Dr. Vance will be able to provide you with a more accurate prognosis after a thorough examination. Reversing the damage completely isn't always possible, but in some cases, treatment can restore some lost vision. Again, Dr. Vance will be able to provide you with a more accurate assessment of your individual situation. While the possibility of complete blindness exists, it’s relatively rare with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We’re being proactive by ordering these tests so we can develop a plan to protect your vision. I understand your financial concerns, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to help. Coastal Eye Center has a financial assistance program for patients who qualify. My office can also assist you in exploring other options for financial assistance. We'll figure something out. Don’t worry about that right now. Please, don't give up hope. We’re going to work together to figure this out. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Vance, and my office will schedule an appointment for you. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Very well. I… suppose there’s nothing else to be said. I confess, I'm not particularly optimistic. But… thank you, Doctor. For… for trying. I’ll… I’ll schedule an appointment with this… Dr. Vance. And I’ll… I’ll see what I can do about the financial assistance. I confess, I'm growing increasingly weary. Perhaps… perhaps it's time to simply… accept my fate. It's not as if… it's not as if I have much to lose, after all. Though even that… is becoming increasingly difficult. Thank you again, Doctor. For… for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Al Corta. Please remember that I’m here if you have any further questions or concerns. Don't hesitate to reach out. We’ll do everything we can to help you navigate this. Wishing you all the best, and please take care of yourself. Goodbye, Mr. Al Corta.
