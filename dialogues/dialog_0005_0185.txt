DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's my breath. It smells. Bad. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my ex-husband… well, he made a point of mentioning it before he left. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, it’s good you’re addressing it. Even if it is just because of him. Let's not minimize things just because of the source. "Smells bad" is pretty vague, though. Can you describe the smell?
PATIENT: Ugh, describe it? How am I supposed to describe a bad smell? It smells… rotten? Like, old food, maybe? I don’t know. It’s just… unpleasant. I brush my teeth, okay? Twice a day. Sometimes more if I have something… garlicky. Is that what you need to know? What kind of doctor asks someone to describe a smell? It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve been doing this for seventeen years. Everything smells eventually. It helps me narrow down the possibilities. Rotten…okay. And has this been going on for a long time, or is it recent?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. Like, the last few months. Before that, it was fine. Look, I really don’t have time for a whole investigation, alright? I work on the highway. It's not like I can just…sit around sniffing my breath all day. It’s probably just stress, okay? He really got to me. It’s probably just… a nervous thing.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute, certainly. But it’s still worth checking. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this…odor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what? I don't get sick often. I mean, I had a cold last winter, but everyone gets those. No… no sore throats, no weird tastes in my mouth, no… I don’t know. Look, I feel perfectly healthy, aside from the obvious. I just want something to make it stop, alright? Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask. Let’s do a quick exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Open wide, please. And don't worry, I've seen…worse.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly. It’s probably nothing. Just…do it quickly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Tongue looks normal, no obvious lesions. Gums are a little inflamed, but not terribly so. You do seem to have some tartar buildup. And I do notice a bit of postnasal drip. Any congestion, or a feeling like something’s running down the back of your throat?
PATIENT: Postnasal drip? Maybe. I mean, sometimes my nose feels a little stuffy, but it’s just… allergies, probably. The pollen's been awful this year. I don't usually bother with anything for it, honestly. I just…deal with it. Is that relevant? Are you going to tell me I need to take allergy medicine now? Because I really don't have the time for that.
DOCTOR: It could be related. Allergies can definitely cause postnasal drip, and that can contribute to bad breath. But we can't rule out other things. Have you noticed any fever, or pain in your sinuses?
PATIENT: No fever. And no pain. Look, I told you, I feel fine. I work outside all day. I’m perfectly healthy. It’s just…the breath. It’s probably stress. Or, like you said, allergies. Can we just agree on that and be done with it? I have a shift starting in three hours.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you’re busy. But I’m not comfortable just dismissing this without a little more information. While stress and allergies are possible causes, bad breath can also be a sign of other issues – things like an infection, even something dental. I’m going to recommend a basic blood test, just to rule out anything serious. And I’d like you to see a dentist, if you haven’t been in the last six months. It’s a simple checkup. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Seriously? For breath? Look, I'm not paying for a blood test. And I haven't been to the dentist in… a while, okay? I don’t have insurance, and it’s expensive. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just wanted something to mask the smell. Like, a mouthwash or something. Can you just give me a recommendation for a really strong mouthwash? I’m not doing any tests. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I understand your concerns about cost and time. But I have a responsibility to ensure you're properly evaluated. I'm not trying to waste your time, I’m trying to rule things out. Since you’re declining the blood test and dental visit… I’ll recommend a chlorhexidine mouthwash. It's a strong antiseptic and may help temporarily. But if the problem persists, or gets worse, you really need to see a dentist. And please, consider a basic checkup when you're able. Here’s a prescription for the mouthwash. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. .
