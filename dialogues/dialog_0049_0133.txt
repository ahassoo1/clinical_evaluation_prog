DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these forms. I need them notarized, I guess? They're for… some health things. I just don't want to mess anything up, and I thought a doctor's office would be the best place to get them done right. It's all a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Notarization isn't quite what we do here, Ms. Tippens. We provide medical care. These forms… are they related to a current health issue?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, yes, sort of. I’ve been having… trouble sleeping. And some dizziness. Nothing terrible, but it's enough that they sent me these forms to fill out. I assumed getting them verified here would be helpful. I don't understand why they'd send me to fill them out if they weren't for a doctor to look at, though. Are you saying you can’t just… sign them?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, simply signing legal documents without assessing your health situation is… inappropriate, and frankly, unethical. We need to understand why you’re being asked to fill out these forms. Let’s focus on the sleeping and dizziness. How long have you been having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I didn’t mean to cause trouble, dear. It's been… a few months, I suppose. Maybe three? It comes and goes. Some nights I’m fine, others I’m up half the night. And the dizziness… not all the time, just when I stand up too fast, usually. It’s not… scary, just annoying, you know? Is this what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Three months of intermittent sleep disturbance and dizziness upon standing. Okay. And is anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, isn't everyone? And my appetite hasn’t been great, but that comes and goes too. I don't really feel sick, just… worn out. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: "Worn out" is rather vague, Ms. Tippens. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I think I've lost a little. Not much, but my clothes feel looser. I haven't weighed myself in a while, to be honest. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, no. Not regularly, anyway. I have some aspirin for headaches, but I hardly ever use it. And allergies… well, I used to be allergic to bee stings, but that was a long time ago. I haven't been stung in years. I don’t think I have any current allergies, no. Is that everything? I’m starting to feel a bit silly listing everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss possible causes. Please sit up and let me listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, perhaps, we can rule out the most obvious issues.
PATIENT: Okay, dear. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I'll try to be still. Is this going to take long? I have a lunch date with my niece later.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… rather low. 108/62. And pulse is weak and a little fast – 88. This is… concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning? What does that mean? Is it something serious? I haven’t been feeling that bad, honestly. Just a bit tired, like I said. Maybe I just need more rest. Could it be the heat? It's been awfully warm lately. I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, low blood pressure and a weak pulse, combined with your reported weight loss and fatigue, could indicate a number of issues. We need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Also, I would like you to have an EKG to check your heart rhythm. We need to rule out anemia, dehydration, and potential thyroid problems.
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Oh, my. That sounds… serious. How much is all of that going to cost? I don't… I don’t have insurance, you see. I really hadn't planned on all this. Is it… is it something really bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your concern. The cost… will depend on the lab. I can have the office staff look into the prices for you. As for the seriousness… it’s too early to say. That’s why we need these tests. We are simply gathering information at this point. But, given your symptoms, it’s prudent to investigate. I’m also concerned about your weight loss; that’s rarely benign. We need to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. Will I be able to drive myself home after all this? I live a bit far out, and my niece… she’s relying on me. And what if it is something bad, Doctor? What then?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, let’s not jump to conclusions. We haven't even done the tests yet. As for driving… it depends on how you feel after the blood work. If you feel dizzy or weak, I'll advise you to have someone drive you home. And if, as you say, it is something serious… we will discuss treatment options. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. I’m going to write you a lab order and a referral for the EKG. The staff will schedule those for you. Then, we’ll follow up next week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please let it not be anything too serious. I really don't want to be a bother. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I think I'll just… wait for the staff, then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The staff will be with you shortly. .
