DOCTOR: Hello, Stephane. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite simple. I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of one ear. And my face… well, it feels a bit droopy on one side. It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least. I expect a quick diagnosis and a faster solution.
DOCTOR: Hmm. One ear, you say, and facial drooping… alright. And this happened this morning?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. Before breakfast, actually. I was reaching for the orange juice and noticed it felt… different. I didn’t bump my head or anything. It just is. Do you need a detailed timeline of my breakfast? Because I assure you, it wasn't particularly eventful.
DOCTOR: No, no breakfast details are necessary, thank you. It's just… important to get a clear picture. Can you tell me exactly how it feels different?
PATIENT: Different… well, it feels like there's cotton in my ear. A very thick cotton. And when I try to smile, the left side of my face doesn’t quite… cooperate. It's subtle, but I know my face. I've looked at it for 59 years. Are you going to do something or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: I am doing something. I'm gathering information. It's… rather crucial before I start prescribing things, don't you think?
PATIENT: Crucial? It feels more like stalling to me. Look, I’m a busy woman. I have things to do. Is this something serious or can I just take some pills and get on with my life? I don't have time for extensive investigations. It's either fixable or it isn’t.
DOCTOR: "Fixable" isn't really how medicine works, Stephane. But I understand you're concerned, and I'll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with a quick exam. I need to check your reflexes, maybe look in your ears… standard things. Can you follow my gaze?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Look in my ears? Honestly. I suppose I have little choice. Just… be quick about it. And please, don't poke around unnecessarily. I have a very low tolerance for discomfort. Follow your gaze? Fine. But don’t expect me to hold perfectly still if it's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just follow the light with your eyes. Don't blink, if you can help it. Okay. Now, smile for me. Yes, I see what you mean. And stick your tongue out.
PATIENT: . There. Is that satisfactory? It’s rather undignified, you know. All this poking and prodding… Is it Bell’s palsy, or something equally dramatic? My late husband had something similar once, though his was less… sudden. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening. And yes, the asymmetry is quite noticeable. Your ear canal appears clear, no obvious infection. The tongue… also some deviation to the left. This could be Bell’s Palsy, as you suggest. But given the sudden onset and the possibility of other causes… we really need to rule things out. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or headache alongside this?
PATIENT: Headache? No. Dizzy? Occasionally, but that’s just my blood pressure. It fluctuates. I'm not a young woman anymore. Nausea… no. Look, I eat a very sensible diet. It's unlikely to be nausea. Honestly, it all points to Bell’s Palsy, doesn't it? Can’t you just prescribe something for that and be done with it? I really don't have time for a battery of tests. I have a book club meeting this evening. A very important book club meeting.
DOCTOR: Stephane, I appreciate your… eagerness. But prescribing medication without knowing the cause could be… unwise. There are other possibilities, rarer, but serious. We need to consider stroke, a tumor… I'm going to order a stat CT scan of your head, just to be sure. And I want you to get a blood test to rule out any infections. This isn’t about delaying treatment, it's about ensuring the right treatment. .
PATIENT: A CT scan? Blood tests? This is ridiculous! I told you it was Bell’s palsy. My late husband… well, never mind. Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. And I expect a full explanation when the results are in. And if it is Bell’s palsy, I expect a strong dose of whatever will fix this immediately. Now, where do I go for these tests? And will they interfere with my book club? .
