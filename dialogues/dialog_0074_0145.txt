DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here… well, to see if my mother is able to receive care at home. She is getting older, and it is becoming… difficult. I believe you said something about checking if she qualifies for help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, Mr. Bahta. We do offer in-home care services and assess patients for eligibility. To best determine if your mother qualifies, and what level of care might be appropriate, I’ll need to gather some information about her current health situation. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your mother that’s making things difficult?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… complicated. She has been falling more often, you see. Not hard falls, but enough to be concerning. And she… forgets things. Important things, like taking her medicine. My sister and I try to help, but we both have jobs, families… it is hard to be everywhere at once. She lives alone, you understand. It worries me greatly. She used to be so independent.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bahta. It’s very common for families to face these challenges as their loved ones age, and it's admirable that you and your sister are so involved. Falls and memory issues are certainly things we need to explore. To get a clearer picture, let's start with the falls. About how often would you say she’s been falling in the last six months?
PATIENT: Hmm… six months. Let me think. There was one in January, I recall very clearly because she bruised her arm. And then another in March, a small trip over a rug. And… yes, one just last month, in July. So, three times, I believe. Not many, but enough to make me anxious. She insists they are minor, but… she doesn't always remember falling, you see. That is the troubling part.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. The fact that she doesn’t always remember the falls is concerning, as it could indicate more than just simple clumsiness. Now, regarding her memory, could you describe what you mean by "forgetting things?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… varied. Sometimes it is just names. She will be speaking to someone she’s known for years and struggle to recall their name. Other times, it’s more serious. She’s forgotten appointments, left the stove on… little things like that. She also repeats herself, often asking the same question several times in a short period. It is not constant, but it is… frequent enough to be worrying. She seems confused sometimes, like she is… not quite present.
DOCTOR: I see. Those are all signs that warrant further investigation, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like her memory issues are progressively impacting her daily life. Do you know if she has been formally diagnosed with any cognitive impairment, like dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, she has not. She… resisted going to the doctor for a long time. Stubborn woman, my mother. She always said she was “just getting old.” We finally convinced her to see a general practitioner last year, but he didn’t seem too concerned. He just said to monitor things. He did not do any… specific tests, I don’t believe. Just a general check-up. She refused to see a specialist.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A general check-up is a start, but often doesn't fully assess for cognitive issues. Now, let’s talk about her medical history. Do you know if she has any significant past medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has high blood pressure, she's been taking medication for that for… oh, at least ten years, I think. And she had a mild heart attack about five years ago, but she recovered well. The doctor put her on a statin, and she’s been taking that regularly. She also has arthritis in her knees, which makes it difficult for her to get around. She complains of pain constantly, I’m afraid. I believe that is all, if I recall correctly. My sister handles most of her appointments and paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, a past heart attack, and arthritis. That's helpful information. Do you know what medications she is currently taking, specifically the names and dosages?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. She has many medications. Let me see… there’s the lisinopril for her blood pressure, I believe 20 milligrams daily. And the atorvastatin, 40 milligrams. For her arthritis, she takes ibuprofen, usually 600 milligrams, but she takes it as needed, so it varies. And she also has something for her knees, a pain cream, but I don’t recall the name. She also takes a daily vitamin, but that is all I can think of at the moment. I apologize for not being more precise. It is a great deal to keep track of.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. It is a lot to keep track of, and it's understandable you don't have all the specifics. We can access her records if she has been to other physicians, or we can work with her to get an accurate list. Now, are there any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. She has never mentioned any allergies. She eats just about anything, to be honest. She is not a fussy eater. She enjoys her food very much. I do not recall her ever having a reaction to anything. My sister would likely know for certain, but she is at work at the moment.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And finally, let’s talk a little about her social history. Does she live alone currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, she lives alone in her own home. She has lived there for over fifty years, ever since she and my father bought it. She is very independent, or was very independent. She used to enjoy gardening, and she would have friends over for tea. But she doesn’t see many people now. She gets lonely, I think. I visit her several times a week, and my sister visits when she can, but it is not the same. She misses my father greatly. He passed away ten years ago. It changed her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bahta. Losing a spouse is a significant life event, and it's understandable that it has affected her. Okay, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It gives me a much clearer picture of your mother’s situation. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical and cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of her current abilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary to help her, I am agreeable. She may not be pleased, she dislikes being fussed over, but I will explain it is for her own good. Is there anything I should prepare beforehand? Or anything she should avoid doing today?
DOCTOR: That's very considerate of you, Mr. Bahta. No, nothing specific needs to be done beforehand. It's best if she takes her medications as usual. Just let her know we’re going to do a few simple checks to see how she’s doing. If you don't mind, could you please have her sit comfortably in the chair?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Mother? Could you come with me, please? The doctor would like to ask you a few questions. It will not take long. She is a bit… stubborn, as I mentioned, but she will cooperate… eventually. She is just worried about losing her independence.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Bahta. It's very common to feel that way. We'll do our best to make her comfortable. Let's begin when she's ready. We'll start with a few basic questions about her day-to-day life, and then we’ll proceed with a quick physical assessment.
PATIENT: .
