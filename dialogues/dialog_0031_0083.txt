DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? Yes, well. It’s… a small thing, really. Not a real sickness. More of… a need for a little boost. My daughter, she thinks I need a… a card. A “get well” card. Even though I am well. Mostly. She worries too much, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling generally healthy, but perhaps experiencing some fatigue or a lack of energy that has your daughter concerned. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by needing a “boost”?
PATIENT: “Boost”… well, she said something about… encouragement. Like I’m down in the dumps. Which is ridiculous. I’m a stationary engineer, Doctor. I run things. Boilers, generators… big important things. A little tired, maybe. It’s the heat, you know? This summer is… something else. But not “down”. I just thought… a card from you might… satisfy her. She's very insistent.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're feeling a bit more tired than usual, possibly related to the heat, and your daughter is understandably concerned. It's good of you to come in to address her worries. Let's explore this a bit further. When you say “tired,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Well, it's… not like I can't do things. I went fishing last weekend. Hauled in a nice snapper, I did. But… afterwards. I needed to sit. Longer than usual. And the next day, a little ache in my bones. Nothing a little liniment didn't fix, but still. It's not pain, Doctor. Just… a heaviness. Like everything takes a little more effort. Like winding a clock that needs oil, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A heaviness, requiring more effort than usual, and some post-exertional fatigue with a slight ache afterward. That’s helpful. Have you noticed this fatigue and heaviness consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Worse when it’s real humid, like it's been. And… when I think about things too much. My ex-wife… always complaining. Always needing something fixed. Makes a man… weary, you know? But no, not every day. Some days I feel fine. Strong as an ox. Other days… I prefer to just sit and read the paper. It’s just… she gets anxious. Wants me to get checked for… things. Silly things.
DOCTOR: It sounds like stress can certainly play a role, Mr. Kammer. And it’s good that you’re aware of that connection. Just to get a more complete picture, let’s briefly review some other areas. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, Doctor. Not at all. I check my temperature sometimes, when I feel a little… off. Always normal. Chills… no. This heat, you don’t get chills. And night sweats… well, I sleep with the fan on high. It’s a warm bed, you understand? Always has been. No, none of that. Just… tired. And my daughter.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… no, not really. I still eat a good breakfast. Eggs, toast, coffee. And I like a nice piece of fish for dinner. Maybe I haven't been as hungry for the big portions like I used to, but that's probably just getting older, right? Weight… I haven't stepped on the scale in a while. Always avoided scales, to be honest. They just make a man feel bad.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Many people prefer not to focus on the scale. Let’s move on. Have you been experiencing any difficulty breathing, coughing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Breathing…? No, Doctor. I sing in the church choir, you know. I need good lungs for that. Coughing… a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing serious. Chest pain…? No, no chest pain. I'm a strong man, Doctor. I work with heavy machinery all day. If I had chest pain, I’d know about it.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function?
PATIENT: Now you’re asking personal questions, Doctor. Is this necessary? I came in for a card, remember? I mean, everything’s… regular. As regular as it’s ever been. Look, I’m not a delicate flower. I eat good food, drink plenty of water. Everything goes in, everything comes out. As it should.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if those questions felt too personal. I understand you came in initially at your daughter’s request, and I respect that. I am simply trying to gather a complete picture of your health. It’s standard procedure to ask about these things. However, if you’re uncomfortable, we can certainly focus on your primary concerns. Would you prefer we skip those questions and discuss your fatigue and what might be contributing to it?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Skip the… the examinations. I just want her to stop worrying. A card from a doctor… that’s all she wants. A little piece of paper to make her feel better. Maybe you can write something about… taking it easy? And getting enough rest? That's what she tells me all the time, anyway. Rest. Like I've got nothing better to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. We can absolutely do that. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you are experiencing some fatigue, likely exacerbated by the heat and potentially stress. While a thorough examination would be ideal, I respect your wishes. Given your strong history, absence of red flag symptoms like fever, chest pain, or significant weight loss, and your desire to avoid extensive testing, I believe a conservative approach is reasonable at this time. I'll document your symptoms and write a note for your daughter reassuring her that you've been evaluated and we are focusing on supportive care. I can recommend prioritizing adequate hydration, getting sufficient rest, and managing stress levels. Perhaps some gentle exercise when you're feeling up to it, and avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day. Would you like me to write that specifically in the note?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfect. Hydration, rest, gentle exercise. All the things she tells me. Put that in there. And maybe… maybe something about me being a strong man? Just a little something. She likes to hear that. And thank you. For… understanding. It’s nice to have a doctor who listens, instead of just… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I'm happy to help. I’ll be sure to include that you're a strong and active individual, and that we're focusing on maintaining your well-being with hydration, rest, and gentle exercise as needed. Just a moment while I finalize this. Here you go. This is for your daughter. I hope it provides her with some reassurance. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… that’s everything. Thank you again. For the card, and for listening. It was… a pleasant visit, all things considered. I think I’ll be going now. And thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Kammer. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. And do take care of yourself. Have a good day, and give your daughter my best. .
PATIENT: .
