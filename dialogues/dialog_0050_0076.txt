DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's these bumps on my legs... my shins, mostly. They're kinda painful, and red. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I see. “Bumps on the legs, primarily the shins, with associated pain and redness.” And by “a little while,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... a couple of months now? It started with just one, I think, and then more kept showing up. Not all at once, you know? Just slowly, over time. It's hard to say exactly when though, honestly. I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse, or better?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I don't think so... not really. I work outside a lot, moving things around, so maybe when it's really hot? But even when it's cooler, they still bother me. Nothing I've tried seems to help much, either. Just regular lotion, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, outdoor work, some association with heat, but persistent regardless. Lotion has not provided significant relief. And are these bumps... itchy, painful, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly painful, Doctor. Not so much itchy. Like... a deep ache, you know? Especially if I bump them on something. They get really sore then. Sometimes they feel a little warm, too. Not feverish, just... warm.
DOCTOR: Painful, deep ache aggravated by trauma, with some associated warmth. I’d like to take a look at them directly, if you wouldn’t mind. Please, have a seat on the examination table and we'll get started.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds good. Here we go. Hope these aren't too bad to look at.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Several erythematous, firm nodules, approximately 0.5 to 1 centimeter in diameter, located on the anterior aspect of both tibias. No signs of open ulceration or drainage at this time. Palpable, but no significant warmth to the touch beyond what you’ve described. No regional lymphadenopathy detected. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... not really. I'm a little tired sometimes, but that's just from the work, I think. My knees bother me a bit, but that's old age, probably. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just these bumps on my legs. And the ache, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. No systemic symptoms, just localized pain and the nodules. Given the appearance and your history of outdoor work, my initial thought is that these could be stasis dermatitis or, possibly, some form of localized trauma-induced inflammation. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lower extremity ultrasound to rule out any deeper venous insufficiency. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. A lot of tests. I don’t know… is that really necessary? I just want these bumps to go away, Doctor. Are they… serious? I just don’t like going to the hospital and all that. I'm a simple man, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Aluia. It is a few tests, but they are necessary to rule out more serious conditions and ensure we arrive at the correct diagnosis. While they may appear benign, it's crucial to determine the underlying cause. Venous insufficiency, for instance, can lead to complications if left untreated. The tests will give us a clearer picture and allow for appropriate management. We can start with the blood work here in the office, and the ultrasound can be scheduled at a convenient imaging center nearby. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. If it's to make sure it's not serious, I guess. Blood work here is okay. I don't want to run all over town for an ultrasound if I can help it. Just get this over with, right? What do I need to do for the blood work? Do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Very good. No, you do not need to fast for the blood work. I'll have my nurse draw the samples now. It will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and avoiding any activities that aggravate the pain. We'll discuss the ultrasound scheduling after the blood work is drawn. I'll step out to prepare the orders and my nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good, Doctor. Thank you.
