DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I'm not sure where to even begin, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “stuck” is a good way to describe it, and it’s perfectly alright not to know where to begin. We can figure this out together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about what “stuck” feels like?
PATIENT: It's…a lack of energy, mostly. Not constantly tired, but just…not having energy. And things that used to be easy feel harder. I used to enjoy gardening, walking…now, I just feel…less motivated. It’s been going on for a few months, I think. Not getting worse, just…persistent. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, definitely. A persistent lack of motivation and low energy for a few months is something we should explore. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say things feel “harder”, can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Well, my garden... I used to be out there for hours, weeding, planting, just enjoying it. Now, if I spend fifteen minutes out there, I’m completely drained. And it’s not physical exhaustion, exactly. It’s more…mental. Like it takes all my effort just to start, and then it feels like a huge accomplishment to do a little bit. And then I just…stop. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it's impacting your enjoyment of activities you used to find fulfilling. Okay. Now, outside of gardening, are there any other areas of your life where you’re experiencing this difficulty with motivation or energy?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit with socializing. I enjoy seeing my friends, but I find myself making excuses more often. “Too busy,” or “not feeling up to it.” And even little things around the house…keeping things tidy, cooking…it all feels like a chore now. My husband, he’s very understanding, but I feel bad. I used to enjoy taking care of things, and now…it’s just a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it sounds like this is affecting several aspects of your life. Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like thyroid problems, diabetes, or depression?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I did have some issues with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a while now. Other than that…no, nothing that I’ve been formally diagnosed with. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. That’s what’s so strange about this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, and ibuprofen as needed. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I do get seasonal allergies – a little bit of pollen in the spring – but nothing serious. Just a runny nose and some sneezing, easily managed with over-the-counter antihistamines.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she developed some heart problems later in life. My father was healthy for most of his life, but he was eventually diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. And my sister has always struggled with anxiety. That’s about it, really. No major illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your mother, type 2 diabetes in your father, anxiety in your sister. That's good information. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m married, as you know. My husband and I have been married for twenty-five years. We both used to be very active, but he retired a few years ago and we've slowed down a bit. I used to work full time, but now I do some freelance work, mostly casting for local theater productions. It’s not very demanding physically, mostly administrative tasks. I eat a fairly healthy diet, I think – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good sense of things. So, to recap: you’re experiencing persistent low energy and decreased motivation for several months, affecting your gardening, socializing, and household tasks. You have a history of well-controlled high blood pressure, and a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and anxiety. You have a healthy lifestyle overall. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s routine, and will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please proceed. I appreciate you being so thorough. I just want to figure out what's going on, and get back to feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's what we're here for. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m also going to check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. I'll also check your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. Reflexes are normal, coordination is good. Everything seems within normal limits on the physical exam. Now, given your symptoms and the normal physical exam, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, or anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good next step. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get some answers. What exactly will the blood work involve? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood work will be a pretty standard panel. We’ll check a complete blood count – that looks at your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We’ll also check a comprehensive metabolic panel – that looks at your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And we'll check your thyroid stimulating hormone – TSH – to rule out any thyroid issues. We'll also check Vitamin D and B12 levels, as deficiencies can sometimes cause fatigue and low energy. It will just be a routine blood draw, and it should only take a few minutes. The results usually come back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. All of those tests make sense. A few days is fine; I’m not in any immediate distress, thankfully. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So, where do we go from here? Do I need to schedule an appointment to get the blood drawn, or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll write you a lab order, and you can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. There should be a few conveniently located labs around here. The lab will schedule the appointment for you. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you again for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. I'll get the lab order and schedule the blood work as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
