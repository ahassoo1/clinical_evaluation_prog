DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, have a seat. Seventy years young, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Seventy. Or close to it. Time… time goes quick, you know? My wife, she always reminds me. We… we want to maybe have a baby. It’s… a long story.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… not me have baby, directly. My wife… she is younger. Much younger. And… we thinking about it. Is possible? It's… a bit complicated, I think. I don't… I don't really know all the things.
DOCTOR: Right. Complicated is… one word for it. Well, let’s start with the basics. You’re 70, and your wife is… significantly younger. That brings up a few things. Now, I’m a family doctor, so I can cover the general health aspects, but this situation… it’s not exactly standard. Do you mind if I ask how old your wife is?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, yes, of course. She… she is forty-two. Forty-two, this year. Is… a good age, right? For… trying? I don’t… I forget things sometimes. My wife does all the remembering. She said we need to talk to someone… about… chances. And… what happens.
DOCTOR: Forty-two… alright. That’s… still within childbearing years, yes, but it does introduce some considerations. And you’re right to ask about chances. The older a woman is, the lower the chance of conception, and the higher the risk of complications during pregnancy. Now, let's talk about your health first, Mr. Carlotta. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Hmm. Not… recently. Maybe five years ago? Doctor checked… heart and things. I’m usually… okay. I make things. Little models. Metal and plastic. Keeps my hands busy. No big problems. Except… sometimes my memory. But my wife says it’s just my age. Is that… important? For… the baby?
DOCTOR: Well, everything is important, Mr. Carlotta. We need to establish a baseline. Five years is a long time. We need to check your overall health, make sure there are no underlying issues that could affect… things. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My wife does all the remembering, you know. I… I don’t think so. The doctor, five years ago, said my blood pressure was a little high, maybe? But he gave me… pills. I took them for a while. I think. I… I can’t really remember. Is it okay if I ask my wife? She knows all this. She keeps the papers. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, it's perfectly alright to ask your wife. In fact, it would be very helpful. We need a clear medical history, Mr. Carlotta. Do you happen to know the name of those pills you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No, I don’t. Small white pills, maybe? Or… yellowish? I really can’t remember. My wife, she… she handles all the medicine. She has a special box for everything. I just… take them when she tells me to. Is this… a problem? Is it bad that I don't remember? I’m sorry. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, this is a problem. We are discussing the possibility of bringing a child into the world. This requires careful consideration and a thorough understanding of both your and your wife’s health. Not knowing your medication history, or even basic details about your past health, is… concerning. I’m going to need your wife here to provide that information. Otherwise, I’m not sure how much further we can proceed. Do you think she could come in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, yes, I understand. You are right. It’s… it’s important. I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it was so… serious. She can come. Yes. She’s… just getting some groceries. She won’t be long. Is… is everything okay? Is it… is it impossible?
DOCTOR: I’m not saying it’s impossible, Mr. Carlotta. But it is… high-risk. And we need accurate information before we can even begin to assess that risk. We'll need to discuss potential complications, fertility treatments, and the long-term implications for both of you. Let’s just focus on getting your wife in here so we can get a clear picture of everything. Do you have her contact information, in case she needs to be reached?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Her name is Aaliyah. Aaliyah Mohamed. And her number… Is… 555-123-4567. She always tells me to remember it. She says it's important. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Aaliyah Mohamed, 555-123-4567. I'll have the receptionist contact her. In the meantime, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? Oh. What does that mean? I… I used to live in Somalia, a long time ago. But I’ve been here… in the United States… for many years now. I make models. That's… that's what I do. I don’t… I don’t drink or smoke. My wife… she does a little gardening. Is that… what you mean?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Carlotta, that’s not quite what I mean. By social history, I mean things like your occupation, your level of physical activity, your diet... Do you live with your wife?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes. I live with my wife. We have a small house… in the suburbs. I make models… in the garage. And I… I try to walk a little bit. Not much. My wife… she cooks. Very healthy food. Lots of vegetables. And fish. She is very good cook. Is… is this important for the baby too?
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Mr. Carlotta. A healthy lifestyle is important for any pregnancy. But frankly, right now, I need more concrete information. I'm going to need your wife here to clarify a lot of things. We'll discuss your diet and activity level in more detail when she arrives. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a problem. But… my wife always checks. She reads the labels on everything. She’s very careful. I… I trust her to know. I get a little… fuzzy sometimes. But she remembers everything. Is… is she almost here? I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Carlotta. I've sent the receptionist to get your wife. In the meantime, let’s see if I can get a basic understanding of your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… I… I think so. A long time ago. When I first came to this country. I… I was very sick. But it was… many years ago. I don’t remember exactly what it was. Just… very sick. They gave me… medicine. And I got better. My wife… she probably knows more. She keeps all the papers. Is this… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I'm going to be frank with you. This is… complicated. We are discussing a potential pregnancy with a significant age gap and with limited information regarding your medical history. It's crucial that we have a complete picture of your health before proceeding. A past hospitalization, without knowing the reason, is… concerning. I need your wife here. I’m going to ask the receptionist again. Please try to remain calm.
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Of course. You are right. My wife… she’s usually very prompt. Maybe… maybe she’s having trouble finding parking? She doesn't like to rush. She says it’s bad for her blood pressure. Is… is it still possible? Is there still a chance? Even if I… forget things?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I'm not going to discuss the possibility of a successful pregnancy until I have a clear understanding of both your and your wife's health. It's irresponsible to offer false hope without proper assessment. I need your wife here so we can gather the necessary information. Please, try to relax. I understand this is stressful, but right now, the best thing you can do is let me speak with her.
