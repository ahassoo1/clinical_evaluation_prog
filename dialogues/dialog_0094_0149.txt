DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. I see you’re 83 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, hello dear. Dr… Gegan, was it? It’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Look, I don’t really do all this doctor business. All these tests and poking… honestly. I just… I want to be left alone, really. I’m not sick. Not really. Just… old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit frustrated with having to come to the doctor, and that’s perfectly alright. Many people feel that way. I promise I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible for you. When you say “just old,” could you tell me a little bit more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, comfortable... That’s a good one. They never are, are they? Honestly, it’s my feet. They ache, mostly. Always have, really. My mother’s feet were the same. Terrible bunions, she had. Horrible. I had them fixed years ago, but they just… bother me. And now this new doctor wants to do more tests. What for? I’ve lived this long, haven’t I? Seems to me that’s proof enough.
DOCTOR: You’ve certainly lived a long life, Wynell, and that is something to be proud of. It’s good you mentioned your mother’s bunions – that can sometimes give us clues. So, it sounds like the main concern is the pain in your feet, even after having them fixed some time ago. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly goes, if I’m honest. I just… don’t want a fuss. Young doctors these days, always wanting to do something. Back in my day, you just wrapped it up and got on with it! Constant? No, not constant. Just… annoying. Especially when it’s damp. Makes 'em ache something fierce. And I don't want any of those fancy shoes, either. They're all so ugly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It sounds like the damp weather definitely makes things worse, and you'd prefer to avoid unnecessary interventions. We definitely don't want to give you ugly shoes! So, the pain is worse in damp weather, and otherwise it’s manageable. Besides the damp weather triggering it, are there any other times or activities that make the pain worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well... standing for too long. Always has been. I used to be a dancer, you know. Podiatrists, they call us. Fancy name for someone who fixes feet. But all that standing... ruined 'em, really. And sitting with 'em crossed is just awful. Makes 'em numb. As for better… nothing much, really. A hot soak sometimes. But honestly, I just try to ignore it. Is that so wrong? I’ve lived eighty-three years. A little foot pain isn't going to kill me.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not wrong at all, Wynell. Ignoring it has gotten you this far, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to continue that if possible. Your history as a dancer is very helpful information, though – it explains a lot. So, standing for long periods makes it worse, sitting crossed makes them numb, and a hot soak helps a little. Is there any swelling or redness in your feet, besides the pain?
PATIENT: Swelling? Sometimes. After a long day, maybe. Not always. And redness… no, not usually. They just… feel old, is all. Like they’ve done too much. Which they have, I suppose. All those years dancing… foolish, really. Shouldn’t have pushed myself so hard. But you're young, you wouldn't understand. A hot soak and a good sit down... that's all they need. Not more poking and prodding. Honestly, I don’t know why they even bother asking.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Wynell. And you’re right, I may be too young to fully appreciate all you’ve experienced. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full life, and it’s understandable you're hesitant to revisit old injuries. Just to be thorough, and to make sure there isn’t anything else going on, would you mind if I just took a quick look at your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Quick? They always say quick. It never is, is it? Fine. But don’t go poking around too much. And don’t tell me I need to lose weight. I know my weight. And it's my business. Just a quick look, you say? I suppose… but gently now. I bruise easily, you know. Old age, it does things to you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. A quick look, and I promise to be very gentle. And no, I won’t mention your weight. That’s completely your business. Okay. I’m just feeling around now. It looks like you have some calluses on the soles of your feet, which is common with dancing, and some mild swelling around the ankles. I’m checking your range of motion… a little stiffness, but nothing too concerning. Are you feeling any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: A little stiffness, you say? That's putting it mildly. They feel like tree trunks! And no, not much pain right now. Just… discomfort. Honestly, I've had more comfortable nights sleeping on a bed of nails. And please, stop poking. It's just… unnerving. I've never liked anyone touching my feet. Especially doctors. It's a personal thing, you understand. Now, are we done? Can I go now? I have a very important appointment with my television.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Wynell. We’re done. I apologize if the examination was uncomfortable or unnerving. I completely understand that having your feet touched isn’t pleasant, and I should have been more sensitive to that. Based on what you've told me and the quick look I took, it sounds like you’re dealing with some age-related changes in your feet, likely exacerbated by your history as a dancer. The stiffness and discomfort are common. I'm not seeing anything alarming that requires immediate intervention. However, to rule out anything else and to discuss ways to manage the pain and stiffness, I would recommend a simple X-ray of both feet. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh, goodness. More tests. Honestly, it never ends, does it? Look, I appreciate you not finding anything alarming. That’s good enough for me. I don’t want any more poking and prodding. I’m eighty-three years old. Let me live out my days in peace, with my television, thank you very much. I think I’ll just stick to the hot soaks. And maybe a new pair of slippers. Comfortable slippers. That’s all I need. No X-rays. No fuss. Please.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Wynell. Your comfort and peace of mind are the most important things. If you’d prefer to skip the X-ray and stick with the hot soaks and comfortable slippers, that’s perfectly fine. So, we’ll just focus on managing the pain with conservative measures – hot soaks, comfortable footwear, and avoiding prolonged standing. If the pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. Here's a little handout with some tips for foot care and comfortable footwear. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
