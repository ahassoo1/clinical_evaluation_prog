DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Regurgitation, the lady on the phone called it. It happens mostly after I eat, and it’s… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And frankly, at my age, I don’t need any more unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. I appreciate you being direct. “Regurgitation” is a good way to describe it. It is unpleasant, and we'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say after you eat, could you tell me a bit more about how long after eating this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, don't need a lecture on the body, Doctor. It's usually… within an hour, maybe two. Sometimes sooner. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, steak, a sandwich… it all seems to end up trying to come back up. Though, to be honest, I mostly eat good food. Not one of those people who lives on junk. You understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Altine. It’s helpful to know it happens regardless of the food you’re consuming, and within that one to two hour window. That narrows things down a bit. Could you describe what this “coming up” is like?
PATIENT: Like I said, unpleasant. It's… warm. And acidic. Burns a bit. Not like violent vomiting, thankfully. More like… a bad aftertaste trying to revisit. And it leaves a sour feeling in my throat. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. A man my age shouldn't be dealing with this. Do you need me to draw you a picture? Because I’m not going into more detail than that.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, a picture isn’t necessary at all. You’ve described it very clearly – warm, acidic, burning sensation, and a sour taste lingering in your throat. And I certainly understand your discomfort and frustration. Now, has this been a recent development, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe six months now? Started slow, just a little heartburn, you know? Then it got… bolder. More frequent. Now it’s almost every other meal. And it’s not getting better, that’s for sure. I tried some antacids, the kind they advertise on TV, but they barely touch it. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual worsening, starting with heartburn and progressing to this regurgitation almost every other meal, and antacids haven’t provided much relief. That's helpful information. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this – perhaps a burning sensation in your chest, difficulty swallowing, or a feeling of something being stuck in your throat?
PATIENT: A burning sensation? Yes, sometimes. Right here, in my chest. Not constant, but after I eat, often. And… yes, actually. Difficulty swallowing. Not terrible, but I do feel like… something’s blocking it, sometimes. Like the food doesn’t go down as easily. I just drink more water with my meal. Solves the problem, mostly. But it shouldn’t need solving, you know? A man shouldn't have to engineer his meals.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It certainly shouldn't come to that. The burning sensation in your chest and the occasional difficulty swallowing are important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a healthy man. Always have been. Played soccer until I was fifty. Don't smoke, don't drink much anymore. High blood pressure, maybe, years ago, but the doctor put me on a little pill and it's been fine ever since. That's about it. Nothing major. I'm not one of those people who’s always at the doctor's office. And frankly, I'd like to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Altine. A history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, is helpful to know. And it's good that you were active for so long. Do you currently take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Don't want to be deficient in anything. And sometimes, if I’m really bothered, I take a little something for indigestion. The kind you get over the counter. But that's it. Honestly, I think all these pills people take these days is ridiculous. Weakens the body, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and occasional over-the-counter indigestion relief. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My mother had… stomach problems, I think. Something with ulcers, maybe? A lot of pain. She was always complaining. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. That’s about all I know. They weren’t ones for sharing details. Always very… stoic, you could say. Not like me, complaining to a doctor about regurgitation. Though, this is quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. A history of stomach problems in your mother is worth noting. Now, one last thing, and it’s a bit personal. Could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I eat. I sleep. I watch the news. It's not exactly a glamorous life, Doctor. I’m an Emergency Management Director, so I'm usually stressed. A lot of responsibility. Always preparing for the worst. Not a lot of time for… hobbies, you could say. And I’m married, if that’s what you were asking. Wife's name is Helena. Good woman. Doesn't understand why I'm here wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Altine. That gives me a good sense of your overall situation. Being an Emergency Management Director certainly explains the stress. Okay, based on everything you’ve told me – the regurgitation, the burning sensation, the difficulty swallowing, the history of stomach problems in your mother, and your stress levels – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or GERD. It's quite common, and often manageable. However, to be sure, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. A physical exam? Look, I told you, I don't have all day. And frankly, I don't like being poked and prodded. But… fine. If you insist. Just get it over with quickly, alright? I have things to do. Important things. This regurgitation is disrupting my schedule, and I need to get back to work. So, let's hurry this up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. First, if you could just take a few deep breaths for me... Everything sounds clear there. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. Right… there. Yes. It’s not sharp pain, more like… discomfort. Like something’s swollen. But don’t go poking around too much, alright? I'm not made of iron. And frankly, I don't like being touched. It’s a personal thing. Just tell me what you find, and let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand. Tenderness in the upper abdomen is noted. There doesn't seem to be any significant distension, and I don't feel any masses. However, there is some mild discomfort when I press in that area. Based on this exam, and your history, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of GERD, likely exacerbated by stress. However, to rule out other possibilities – such as a hiatal hernia or esophagitis – I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to undergo an upper endoscopy, and a pH monitoring study?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You’re going to stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No way. I have important things to do, Doctor. I don’t have time for invasive procedures. And a pH monitoring study? What does that even involve? Sounds unpleasant. Look, can’t you just give me something for the heartburn? A stronger pill? Something to stop the regurgitation? I’m a busy man, Doctor. I don't need to be poked, prodded, and have cameras shoved down my throat. Frankly, this is ridiculous. I’m starting to regret coming here. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. An endoscopy and pH monitoring would give us the most accurate diagnosis, but I respect your decision. In that case, we can try a course of medication and lifestyle modifications. I’m going to prescribe you a Proton Pump Inhibitor, or PPI, which will reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. We’ll start with a standard dose, and see how you respond. I also recommend elevating the head of your bed, avoiding large meals before bedtime, and limiting caffeine and alcohol. If your symptoms don't improve within four to six weeks, then we can discuss revisiting the possibility of further testing. Does that sound acceptable to you?
