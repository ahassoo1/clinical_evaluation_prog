DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi, good to see you… I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osga, thank you for seeing me. It’s about my weight, really. I’ve been… carrying a little extra for a while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I was hoping to talk about maybe some medicine that could help. I’m not getting any younger, you know? It’s harder to do things these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weight. Right. And how long has this been… bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been gradual, Doctor. Probably… five, maybe six years now? It didn't used to bother me much, but lately… walking up the stairs is a chore, and I can’t keep up with my grandkids when they visit. It's more about being able to do things, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Five or six years… and you're just now coming in?
PATIENT: Well, I… I didn’t want to bother the doctor over something like this. I figured it was just part of getting older. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I was a big man. But now… it’s more than that, I think. It’s affecting my life. I just don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's not get dramatic. “Affecting your life.” Okay. Have you tried… anything at all to lose weight?
PATIENT: I try to walk a little, Doctor. Not as much as I should, I admit. And I try to eat a little less rice… my wife always made the best rice, so that’s hard. But nothing… really works, you know? It feels like it just keeps creeping up. I’m not very good with diets or exercise plans, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: So, minimal effort. Right. And what exactly do you eat in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Breakfast, usually just toast and coffee. Lunch is often leftovers, whatever my daughter brings over. Dinner… well, that depends. Sometimes fish, sometimes chicken. Rice is usually involved, I’m afraid. And a little bit of dessert if my daughter makes it. I’m not one to refuse a good piece of cake, Doctor. It’s not a bad diet, just… a lot of it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Toast, leftovers, rice… fantastic. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… just my blood pressure, Doctor. The doctor told me it’s a little high, so I take a pill for that every morning. Nothing else, really. I was pretty healthy, up until… well, up until my wife passed. It’s been harder to take care of myself since then, I’ll admit. She always looked after everything.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure. And what’s the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill. I believe… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. My daughter helps me with the refills, so I don’t always pay close attention to the name. She’s a good girl. Very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with that. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife used to tease me about my appetite. She said I could eat a horse! But no allergies, no sensitivities. Just… a bit of extra weight, these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Osumi. Let's have a quick look at your vitals, and then we can discuss options. I'm not promising miracles, you understand. This isn't going to be easy.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. I just… I want to feel better. Anything you think might help, I’m willing to try. Thank you. Let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have a dinner appointment with my daughter later.
DOCTOR: Step on the scale, please. And then we’ll do your blood pressure again, just to confirm. Don't get your hopes up.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As you say. Here we go. I haven't weighed myself in a while… probably for the best.
DOCTOR: Eighty kilograms. And your blood pressure is 140 over 90. Still elevated, despite the Lisinopril. We'll need to address both of these issues. Honestly, Mr. Osumi, lifestyle changes are crucial. This isn't something a pill can fix.
PATIENT: Eighty kilograms… that’s… a lot, isn’t it? I figured it was higher. And the blood pressure… well, I try my best with the pill. What kind of lifestyle changes are you thinking, Doctor? I’m not very good at… changing things, if I’m honest. Maybe just a smaller plate?
DOCTOR: A smaller plate isn’t going to cut it. We’re talking diet – significantly reduced carbohydrates and fats. And exercise. At least thirty minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. Walking is a start, but we need to be realistic. This will require discipline, Mr. Osumi. And commitment. I can prescribe a medication to assist with weight loss, but it won’t work without effort on your part. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: Discipline… commitment… it’s been a long time since I had to think about those things. I… I suppose I could try. Walking more, eating less rice… it won’t be easy, but… for my grandkids, maybe. And to feel better. But honestly, Doctor, it sounds… overwhelming. What kind of medication are we talking about? And what if I… fail?
DOCTOR: We can start with Orlistat. It reduces the absorption of fat. It comes with… side effects. Digestive issues, mostly. And it requires a low-fat diet to be effective. As for failing… Failure is always an option, Mr. Osumi. But we won't dwell on that. We'll monitor your progress, adjust the medication if necessary, and… hope for the best. Honestly, I've seen patients with far less motivation achieve success. It's all about willpower. I’ll write you a prescription. And I want to see you back here in one month for a follow-up. Don’t just come in here for the refills. I want to hear about your diet, your exercise… everything. Are there any questions?
PATIENT: Orlistat… side effects… I see. So, it’s not a magic pill, then. And I have to actually do things. No, I suppose not. One month… I’ll try my best, Doctor. What kind of diet should I be aiming for, exactly? Just… less rice? And what if I have a bad day? Will the medication still work if I slip up? It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m an old man, Doctor. It’s harder to change habits these days.
DOCTOR: Look, just cut back on the processed foods, the sweets, the rice. Lean protein, vegetables, fruits. The basics. And yes, one slip-up won’t ruin everything, but consistently poor diet will render the medication useless. It’s not rocket science. I’m printing out a dietary guideline now. And honestly, Mr. Osumi, if you’re not committed to this, there’s no point. Don’t waste my time or yours. Here. Now, do you have any other questions, or can we be done with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. I’ll… I’ll try my best. I suppose… I’ll see you in a month. .
DOCTOR: Good riddance. .
