DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you see? Been happening on and off for a few weeks now. Not terrible, but… bothersome. I just want to get it checked out, if that makes sense. I don’t want it getting worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tingling in your hands and feet… okay. And you said it’s been happening on and off for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe… six? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, other days it’s… more prominent. It's not constant pain, just… like pins and needles, you know? Mostly when I'm resting, I think. Or maybe just when I notice it, since I'm usually busy. I deliver the mail, you see. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, mostly a pins-and-needles sensation, and you’ve noticed it more when you’re resting. And you deliver mail, which keeps you quite active. That’s good to know. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, I haven't really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it feels a bit worse when it's cold, maybe? But even when it’s warm, it still happens. I wish I could pinpoint something! It's just… there. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, haven’t started any new medications… nothing like that. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No specific triggers, no changes in routine or medications… We’ll try to figure it out. Do you experience any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not really. I mean, I'm 63, Doctor, so things aren’t exactly like they used to be, but I can still do my job. Carrying the mail is pretty physical, you know? I haven’t dropped anything, or had trouble gripping things… no. No weakness, just the tingling. It’s just… worrying, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable weakness. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color, temperature, or any swelling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. I haven’t looked that closely, to be honest. I get home tired, you see, and usually just want to put my feet up. I don't think my skin looks different, but I wouldn’t be sure. No swelling that I've noticed, either. I do get cold feet sometimes, but I always have, even when I was younger. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in skin color or swelling. And the cold feet are something you’ve experienced for a long time. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other parts of your body. Have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps any dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: No dizziness. My vision is… well, it's getting a little blurry, but that's just age, I think. I have an appointment with the eye doctor next month for that. And my balance is… okay. I haven't fallen or anything. I'm pretty steady on my feet, considering. No, nothing like that. Just the tingling. It's really just that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness, blurry vision is being addressed with your eye doctor, and balance is stable. Okay. Now, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. Just for check-ups, nothing serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot with my job. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no problem. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and a gallbladder removal in the past. And you generally consider yourself healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing that I know of, anyway. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I can take most things, I think. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t think I am. No, no allergies. Just… this tingling. It’s getting me worried, that's all. I just want to know what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. And you aren’t currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications. Just… a lot of walking! I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to just… keep moving. So, no, no medications at all. Is there anything else you need to know? I’d really like to get this figured out and get back to work. It’s starting to feel a little harder to concentrate when I'm worried about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications. Alright, Teretha, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Let’s just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I have a route to finish today, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs, and I’m just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. This is perfectly normal. Both reflexes are present and equal, two plus bilaterally. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. There. Is that alright? It feels a little weaker than it used to, maybe? I’ve been carrying heavy mailbags, you know. It’s pretty physical work.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Strength is five out of five bilaterally. That’s good. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton ball. Please tell me when you feel it. Sensation is intact to light touch in all extremities. Now, can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. There. Am I doing it right? It’s a little hard to relax when I’m worried about what you’re going to find. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. Sensation to light touch is intact bilaterally. Okay, Teretha, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears neurologically intact at this time. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, several things could be causing this tingling. It could be related to nerve compression, possibly from your work, or it could be something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help rule out vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work? Is it… serious? I mean, I just have some tingling. I didn’t think it would come to blood work. What kind of conditions are you looking for? I don't want to be a bother, you know. I just want to get back to work. Is it going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Teretha. Think of it as gathering information. We’re just trying to rule out common causes. The blood work will check for things like vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid issues, and diabetes, all of which can sometimes cause tingling in the hands and feet. It's a routine test, and relatively inexpensive. I’ll order it through the lab downstairs, and they’ll bill you directly. It shouldn't be a huge expense. And while we wait for the results, I recommend trying to avoid repetitive hand movements as much as possible and making sure you’re getting enough rest. If the tingling worsens or you develop any new symptoms, like weakness or numbness, please let me know immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that sounds… okay. If it’s just routine, then I guess it’s alright. And I will try to rest more. It’s hard, you know, with the mail route. But I will try. And I’ll let you know if anything gets worse. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a little better. Where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. The lab is just downstairs, to the left of the reception desk. You’ll need to give them your insurance information, and they’ll take it from there. They're used to patients coming from the clinic. Here’s the information. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can call me with any questions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they come back. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I’ll go downstairs and get the blood work done right away. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I’ll see you soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: .
