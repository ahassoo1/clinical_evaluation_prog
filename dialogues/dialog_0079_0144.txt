DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with Medicare, and we're located in a rural setting... perfectly alright. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Pleasure’s all yours, I’m sure. Honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. I was feeling alright, really, but I thought I should probably get checked out. You know, just to make sure. My Harold always said preventative care was important. He was a very sensible man, Harold. Though, goodness knows what he'd think of all this… rural setting indeed. It’s… different.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is advisable, certainly. Though arriving with no specific complaint… well, it makes a focused examination rather difficult. It’s good to be thorough, of course, but we must be efficient with our time. Perhaps you could elaborate on why you felt a check-up was warranted, even though you currently feel “alright”?
PATIENT: Oh, efficient, yes, very important. Harold always said the same thing. Now, let me think… well, it was my neighbor, Agnes. She was telling me about her bunions, dreadful things, and how the doctor found something else while looking at those. Something about her cholesterol, I think. And then Beatrice mentioned a friend who discovered… well, it wasn’t anything nice. So I thought, well, better safe than sorry, you know? It’s just… you never know. Things can sneak up on you.
DOCTOR: Right. So, prompted by anecdotal evidence from acquaintances. I see. While it’s… understandable to be concerned, Ms. Calvery, we shouldn’t base medical decisions on hearsay. However, a general check-up is not unreasonable. To begin, let’s cover some basic history. Have you been experiencing any changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, well, changes… everything changes, doesn’t it? I suppose I’ve lost a little weight. Not much. The heat, you know. Doesn't make you want to eat. And energy… honestly, at my age, what energy? It's not like when I was a surgical tech, running around all day. Though, that was a long time ago. Harold always said I had a good constitution, though. Strong stock, he called it. Korean, you know. We’re a resilient people.
DOCTOR: “A little weight loss” can be significant, Ms. Calvery. Could you give me a rough estimate of how much weight you’ve lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. Let me think… maybe five pounds? Perhaps ten? It's been… a few months, I suppose. Not all at once, you understand. Just… gradually. I haven't been keeping a strict tally. I mostly just notice my clothes fitting a bit looser. Harold used to say I was getting too thin, but I always told him I was just maintaining a healthy figure. He was a worrier, that man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weight loss?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. Well, my knees ache a bit more than usual, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? And sometimes I feel a little… tired. But who doesn’t feel tired? Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m just fine. Maybe Agnes and Beatrice are just hypochondriacs. Though Beatrice did say it was something serious… something with her… I can’t quite recall.
DOCTOR: “A little tired” and aching knees could indicate a number of things. I’m going to need a more comprehensive picture, Ms. Calvery. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a personal question, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor. I mean, really. Bowel habits… Well, everything is… regular enough, I suppose. Not particularly exciting, if that’s what you’re asking. A little… different sometimes. Harder, maybe? But I blame the diet. Not enough fiber, probably. Harold always made sure I had plenty of prunes…
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not bad, exactly. Just… not as strong as it used to be. The heat, you know? It really takes your appetite away. I find myself not wanting to eat as much. I used to love a good bibimbap, but lately, even that doesn’t appeal to me. Harold used to make the best bibimbap. He had a special way of preparing the gochujang… Oh, never mind. I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s focus, Ms. Calvery. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss besides the five to ten pounds you mentioned?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, no, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed. Though, sometimes I feel a little warm, but that’s just from the heat. And chills… no, no chills. And night sweats? Oh, goodness, no. I always sleep quite comfortably. Though, I did wake up a little damp last week, but I think the air conditioning was acting up. Harold always said a good night's sleep was the best medicine. He was a practical man, Harold.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I take a little calcium for my bones, you know, old age. And sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And there was that herbal tea Agnes gave me for my arthritis… something with ginger, I think. And Harold used to give me ginseng… for energy. Oh, and sometimes I take a little antacid after dinner, if I've had something spicy.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications or foods, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, no, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the dust. Harold always said I had sensitive skin. Though, I did have a reaction to some shellfish once, many years ago. A little rash, nothing serious. But other than that, I can eat pretty much anything. I love a good kimchi stew, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I think a brief physical examination is in order, Ms. Calvery. Perhaps it will help us to clarify some of these… vague symptoms. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. Though I do hope it won't take too long. I have a bridge game later this afternoon. And frankly, I’m not a fan of doctors’ offices. They always smell so… clinical. Harold used to say I was a bit of a hypochondriac, but I think I’m just sensible.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, if you’ll please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths… in and out. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Slightly diminished bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid.
PATIENT: Oh, alright Doctor. You're very thorough, I’ll give you that. My thyroid… is that the one that controls your weight? Harold always said I had a slow metabolism. He used to tease me about it, said I could eat anything and never gain an ounce. Though, that was before I started losing weight, of course. He'd be very concerned if he were here. A sensible man, Harold. Always looking out for my well-being.
DOCTOR: Thyroid is palpable, but not significantly enlarged. No nodules appreciated. Now, let’s take a look at your throat. Oropharynx is clear. No signs of infection or inflammation. Physical exam is largely unremarkable. However, the reported weight loss, despite a normal appetite, is concerning. And the diminished bowel sounds… we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, investigate? Goodness. What do you think it is, Doctor? Don’t tell me it's something serious. I’m not one for worrying, you understand, but… I do have that bridge game this afternoon. And Beatrice is bringing her famous lemon bars. Though, she did mention her friend’s… well, never mind. Is it my digestion, do you think? Harold always said I had a sensitive stomach.
DOCTOR: While a sensitive stomach is possible, Ms. Calvery, unexplained weight loss warrants a more thorough investigation. We need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. We’ll also need a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. And I'm going to recommend a colonoscopy. I understand this may be… unpleasant, but it’s essential to rule out any underlying issues in the colon. We’ll discuss the results once they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bleeding, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact me immediately.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A colonoscopy? Goodness gracious. That sounds… invasive. And a stool sample? Well, I never. Harold would be turning in his grave. I thought you said my exam was unremarkable? Now you're talking about… procedures. And tests. And graves. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? I just came in for a little check-up, you know. Curiosity, that's all. And I have that bridge game. Beatrice’s lemon bars are very good.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns. However, while your physical exam didn’t reveal any obvious abnormalities, the reported weight loss is a significant finding. It’s our responsibility to investigate the underlying cause, even if it means ordering further tests. The blood work and stool sample are relatively non-invasive. The colonoscopy is more involved, but it’s the most effective way to rule out any serious conditions, such as colon cancer. I’m not trying to alarm you, but it’s always better to be proactive when it comes to your health. I understand you have a bridge game this afternoon, and I would never ask you to do anything that isn’t necessary. However, I strongly recommend scheduling these tests as soon as possible. We can discuss the preparation for the colonoscopy in detail, and I’ll do everything I can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose not. If you think it’s absolutely necessary. Harold always said I was a bit of a worrier, but he also said it was better to be safe than sorry. Though, he never had to have a… a colonoscopy. Honestly, Doctor, it sounds dreadful. And I do have that bridge game. Beatrice gets quite upset if I’m late. Alright. Fine. But… can you explain exactly what’s involved? And… will it hurt? And… will I be able to eat Beatrice’s lemon bars afterwards? Harold always said lemon bars were my favorite.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me explain the process in detail. The colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum. This allows us to visualize the entire colon and look for any abnormalities, such as polyps or tumors. You'll be given medication to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most patients report feeling little to no pain during the procedure. You may experience some bloating or cramping afterwards, but this is usually mild and temporary. As for your diet, you’ll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure. After the colonoscopy, you can gradually reintroduce solid foods. And yes, you should be able to enjoy Beatrice’s lemon bars afterwards, as long as you tolerate the procedure well. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the colonoscopy, and we’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll also discuss the results of the tests and develop a plan of care based on your individual needs. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose that doesn’t sound too awful. As long as I can have my lemon bars afterwards. Harold always said a little treat now and then was good for the soul. And… what about the stool sample? Is it… complicated? I haven’t had to… do one of those in years. Honestly, Doctor, you're asking an old woman to do a lot. And… will it hurt? Everything seems to involve some sort of discomfort.
DOCTOR: The stool sample is quite straightforward, Ms. Calvery. We’ll provide you with a collection kit and detailed instructions on how to collect the sample at home. It simply involves collecting a small amount of stool in a container and bringing it to the lab for analysis. It shouldn't be painful or uncomfortable. The lab will test the sample for any signs of infection, inflammation, or blood. It’s a simple test that can provide valuable information about your digestive health. I understand you’re concerned about discomfort, Ms. Calvery, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this process as comfortable as possible. We’ll provide you with clear instructions, answer any questions you may have, and be with you every step of the way. And yes, you should be able to enjoy Beatrice’s lemon bars afterwards, as long as you tolerate the tests well. So, shall we schedule the blood work and the stool sample collection today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright Doctor. If you insist. It’s just… a lot for an old woman, you understand. And I really don’t want to miss Beatrice’s lemon bars. Harold always said a little bit of sweetness brightens the day. Yes, fine. Schedule the tests. But… can you make sure the lab technician is… gentle? And can you please remind me again about the clear liquid diet? I tend to forget things these days. Harold used to say I had the memory of a goldfish.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I’ll make a note to ensure the lab technician is gentle. And I'll provide you with a detailed handout outlining the clear liquid diet. It includes a list of acceptable foods and beverages, such as broth, juice, gelatin, and water. You’ll need to avoid solid foods, dairy products, and anything with red dye for 24 hours before the colonoscopy. I’m scheduling the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. And I’m giving you the stool sample collection kit to take home with you. The lab needs the sample within 72 hours. I’m also scheduling a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the test results and develop a plan of care. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Just… remind me about the fasting again? Eight hours before the blood work, you said? And… is there anything else I need to bring with me tomorrow? Besides my insurance card, of course. Harold always said it was best to be prepared. Though, he also said worrying too much was bad for your health. And… can you please make sure the lab technician is… nice? I don’t do well with… gruff people.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery. Eight hours of fasting before the blood work tomorrow. That means no food or drinks after midnight tonight. You can drink water, of course, but no coffee, tea, or juice. And besides your insurance card, please bring a list of any medications you’re currently taking, as well as any allergies you may have. It’s also helpful to wear comfortable clothing with sleeves that can be easily rolled up. I’ll make a note in your chart to ensure the lab technician is… nice. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make your experience as comfortable as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You've been very thorough, even if it is… a lot. Harold would be proud. Though, he always said too much poking and prodding wasn't a good idea. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And please, remind the technician to be gentle. Beatrice is counting on me for her lemon bars. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I’ll make sure to relay your request to the lab technician. I wish you a good night and a pleasant tomorrow. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good evening, Ms. Calvery. .
PATIENT: .
