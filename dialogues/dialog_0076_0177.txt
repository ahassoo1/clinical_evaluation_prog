DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well... it's... something down there. It's... wet. And not good wet, you know? Like… icky. Been happening a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, really. Time slips my mind these days. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: "Icky," right. And bothersome. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about this "icky" wetness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like… regular. You know, not like when a woman… has things happen. It's… coming from him. Down there. And it smells… funny. Not a good funny, either. More like… old. Old and… bad. It’s embarrassing to talk about, really. A lady shouldn’t have to be talking about this.
DOCTOR: "Him," you say. So this is affecting your husband?
PATIENT: Husband? Oh, no, dear. No husband. Never married. It's… me. It's coming from my… parts. You know. Down there. I just… sometimes I get confused. It’s just… it's something a lady doesn't talk about, even to doctors.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. My apologies for the confusion. So, this discharge... how long has this been happening, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Like I said, time… it's gone. Maybe… a month? Two? Could be longer. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little, and I think, “Oh, it’s probably nothing.” Then other times, it’s… more noticeable. I just ignored it for a while. Thought it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: "Ignored it," you say. Well, that’s often the case. Any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. It's just… uncomfortable. And it smells. That’s the worst part. Makes me feel… dirty. And a little scared, if I'm being honest. I don’t get sick often, you see. Haven't been to a doctor in… oh, a long, long time. Things just usually… fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “things” don’t always fix themselves. Any fever, chills, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. Don’t even own a thermometer these days. And fatigue… well, I’m 73 years old, dear. I’m always a little tired. That’s just getting old, isn’t it? It’s not like I’m running marathons, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just have a quick look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Do I have to? It's… awfully personal. And I haven’t… well, I haven't been… down there in a long time, let’s just say that. Is there… no other way? Can’t you just give me some cream?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort. But to determine the cause of this discharge and ensure it's nothing serious, a quick examination is necessary. I’ll be as efficient and discreet as possible. If it’s just a minor irritation, cream might help. But we need to know what we’re treating first.
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. But be quick about it, dear. And try not to… look. It’s embarrassing enough as it is. And don't you go thinking I’ve… been up to no good, either. A lady can’t help getting older, can she?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, if you’d be so kind as to lie down. I'll need to use a speculum, just for a moment. And no, Mrs. Genard, I am not judging.
PATIENT: A… a what-now? A speculum? What does that do? Oh dear… this isn't good. I don’t like this one bit. Is it going to… hurt? You really can’t just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: It allows me to visualize the vaginal canal, Mrs. Genard. There might be a slight pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Hmm. There appears to be some inflammation and a yellowish discharge. Okay. It appears to be some bacterial vaginosis. Not serious, but needs treatment.
PATIENT: Oh! That did feel strange! And cold! Bacterial… what-now? Is that… bad? Is it catching? Oh dear, oh dear. And what do I have to do about it? Pills? Creams? And will it… go away? I just want it to be gone.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not sexually transmitted. It's a common imbalance of bacteria. We’ll prescribe a course of metronidazole gel. You’ll insert it twice daily for a week. That should clear it up. And yes, it will go away. Follow the instructions carefully. And avoid douching. It only makes things worse. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Met… metronidazole? Is that hard to say? And twice a day? Every day? Oh dear, I always forget things. And… douching? I haven't done that in ages! Well, maybe I used to, a long, long time ago. Will I have to come back? I really don’t like coming to doctors. And… is it contagious to my clothes?
DOCTOR: Twice daily for seven days. Write it down. No, it is not contagious to your clothes. And no, you shouldn't need to come back, but if symptoms persist, or worsen, schedule another appointment. I have other patients waiting, Mrs. Genard. Here is the prescription. Take it to the pharmacy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Twice a day… for seven days… write it down… Oh dear. This is all so confusing. I don't even have reading glasses. Let me see… I think I left them at home. Well… I'll just have to ask my neighbor to read it for me. Is it very expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: The cost will vary depending on your insurance. Since you are uninsured, you might want to inquire about generic options at the pharmacy. I have other patients waiting, Mrs. Genard. Please have a good day. .
PATIENT: Generic… options? Oh dear… This is all just too much. I just wanted something for the icky wetness… I suppose I’ll have to ask my neighbor… Everything's just so complicated these days. .
