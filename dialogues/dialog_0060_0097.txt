DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s been rather insistent about getting these… papers sorted. Something about what happens if… if I’m unable to make decisions. An advance directive, I believe he called it? Honestly, I find the whole thing a bit morbid, but he worries so.
DOCTOR: Right. An advance directive. Your husband is a sensible man, wanting to be prepared. It is practical, even if it’s not something most people enjoy thinking about. It’s essentially outlining your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. So, let’s start with the basics. Are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? No, not particularly. I mean, I'm… getting older, naturally. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, that sort of thing. But nothing a good lie-down and a cup of mint tea can’t fix. I generally consider myself quite healthy, thank you. I don’t do illness. It’s… uncivilized.
DOCTOR: “Uncivilized,” alright. Well, that’s… good to hear. Still, even healthy people benefit from a little planning. Stiffness in the mornings could be a number of things, but we won’t dwell on that right now. Let’s talk about other things. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – anything at all, even if it was years ago?
PATIENT: Years ago… hmm. Let me think. There was a… a bad bout of food poisoning on holiday in Spain, decades ago. And… oh, and I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. But nothing serious. Certainly nothing that would require… these forms. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? My husband is making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh quietly, making another note. I glance at Marija, assessing her demeanor. A little dismissive, perhaps?
PATIENT: I understand your hesitation, Marija. But even without serious illness, an advance directive can prevent misunderstandings and ensure your wishes are respected. It’s about having control, even when you’re not able to speak for yourself. Alright. Let's put the past aside for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
DOCTOR: No medications at all?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I pride myself on a very… natural lifestyle. I get plenty of rest, eat a sensible diet – mostly Mediterranean, of course – and I rely on traditional remedies when needed. Mint tea, as I mentioned. And a little bit of argan oil for everything. Honestly, Doctor, I find most modern pharmaceuticals to be… rather alarming. Full of chemicals, no doubt. I prefer to trust in nature's goodness.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies to anything, then?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve spent a good portion of my life travelling, exposing myself to all sorts of climates and… substances. I’ve built up quite the immunity, I assure you. Dust, pollen, certain spices… I’m quite robust. I doubt there’s much that could bother me. Though I do find overly synthetic perfumes rather irritating, if you must know. But that’s more a matter of taste, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mother lived to a good age, thankfully. She always said the secret was olive oil and a strong constitution. My father… he had some heart trouble towards the end, I believe. But he wasn’t one for doctors, so we never really knew the extent of it. And that was generations ago. Mostly, we were a healthy family. Very practical people, not prone to complaining. A bit of… melancholy, perhaps, on my grandmother’s side, but nothing that required medical attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, would you mind telling me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, as I mentioned, I live a very healthy life. I walk daily – not strenuous, of course, one must preserve one’s energy – and I maintain a very balanced diet. I read extensively – mostly literature, naturally, a great deal of French and Arabic poetry – and I enjoy the occasional social gathering with friends. I find intellectual stimulation to be very important. And I avoid stress whenever possible. A quiet, refined existence, you might say. I certainly don’t partake in any… vulgar activities. Do you need me to be more specific?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I find both utterly reprehensible. Smoking is barbaric, and alcohol… well, it simply clouds the mind. I’ve never touched a drop in my life, and I certainly wouldn’t encourage anyone else to partake. It’s a terribly uncivilized habit, and quite detrimental to one’s health, I assure you. I maintain a clear head, thank you very much. A refined palate, yes, I appreciate a good coffee, but that’s quite different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija. I understand you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, let’s shift gears slightly. If you were to become seriously ill and unable to communicate your wishes, who would you want to make medical decisions for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be my husband, of course. He's very… practical. A bit overzealous, perhaps, but ultimately sensible. He worries so, you see. He's the one who insisted on all of this, after all. He's quite organized, and he knows my… preferences, generally. Though I doubt he understands the nuances of my intellectual pursuits. Still, he's perfectly capable. A good man. A bit… pedantic, but good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has your husband discussed with you what specific medical treatments you would or would not want in certain situations?
PATIENT: Specific treatments? Oh, I doubt he's gone into such detail. He mostly talks about… "life support" and "feeding tubes" and things of that nature. He gets rather agitated when he talks about it, to be honest. I mostly nod and try to reassure him that I’m perfectly healthy and won't require any such interventions. He worries about me becoming a… burden, I think. A good man, but he has a rather morbid imagination. He's read too many articles online, I suspect. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather unpleasant. Is this truly necessary?
DOCTOR: Marija, I understand your discomfort. However, it's important to have these conversations, even if they are unpleasant. Let’s try a hypothetical situation. If you were to have a severe stroke and were unable to breathe on your own, would you want a machine to help you breathe?
PATIENT: A machine? Oh, heavens, no! Absolutely not. The thought of being… tethered to a machine is simply dreadful. I prefer a natural end, thank you very much. A peaceful passing, surrounded by loved ones. Not… prolonged suffering in a sterile hospital room. I’ve seen enough of hospitals to last a lifetime, thank you. No, I would not want a machine to breathe for me. It’s… undignified. And quite frankly, barbaric. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about a feeding tube if you were unable to eat on your own?
PATIENT: A feeding tube? Oh, absolutely not. That sounds… positively medieval! I take pride in my refined palate, Doctor. The thought of being… nourished through a tube is simply appalling. I would prefer not to be kept alive artificially if I were unable to enjoy a proper meal. A natural end, as I said. With dignity. Is that clear enough? Honestly, this is all rather upsetting. I feel as though you're trying to talk me into… unpleasant things.
DOCTOR: Marija, I am not trying to talk you into anything. I am simply trying to understand your wishes so that your husband can make informed decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Let’s try another scenario. If you were to develop a serious illness and were in a coma with no chance of recovery, would you want to be kept alive on life support indefinitely?
PATIENT: Indefinitely? Oh, absolutely not! The thought of lying there, unresponsive, for… for who knows how long, is simply dreadful! A complete waste of time and resources, frankly. I have lived a full and meaningful life, thank you very much. I would prefer to… let nature take its course. A dignified end, as I’ve said repeatedly. No prolonged suffering, no artificial interventions. Is that clear enough? Honestly, this is becoming quite… distressing. I feel as though you are trying to… prolong the inevitable. It’s rather morbid, don't you think? I simply want a peaceful end, surrounded by loved ones. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Marija, I understand your distress, and I apologize if I am upsetting you. I am simply trying to ensure that your wishes are respected. Let’s try a different approach. Do you have any specific religious or cultural beliefs that would influence your medical care?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I am a devout Muslim, and my faith is very important to me. I would prefer to be treated with respect and dignity, in accordance with Islamic principles. I would want a quiet, peaceful environment, and I would want my husband to consult with an Imam if necessary. I would want to be washed and shrouded according to Islamic tradition, and I would want my funeral to be conducted in accordance with Islamic rites. It is very important to me that my body is treated with respect, even after death. I do not want any… unnecessary procedures or interventions that would interfere with my spiritual well-being. Is that clear enough? Honestly, I find this conversation rather… intrusive. I feel as though you are questioning my faith.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Marija. That is very helpful. Now, just to confirm, you are opposed to mechanical ventilation, indefinite life support, and a feeding tube if you were unable to eat on your own. You also want your treatment to be guided by your Islamic faith and you wish your husband to consult with an Imam if necessary. Is that a correct summary?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… an accurate summary, I suppose. Although I still find the entire conversation rather… distasteful. But yes, you have correctly understood my wishes. I would prefer a natural end, in accordance with my faith and my values. And I would want my husband to be guided by those principles if I were unable to speak for myself. Honestly, I hope we will not have to revisit this conversation again. It’s rather… depressing. Is there anything else? I would like to leave now, if possible. I have a mint tea awaiting me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija. We have documented your wishes, and your husband will be informed of them. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if this conversation was unpleasant. I don’t believe there is anything else at this time. I will have the nurse escort you out. Please, take care of yourself, and enjoy your mint tea. .
PATIENT: .
