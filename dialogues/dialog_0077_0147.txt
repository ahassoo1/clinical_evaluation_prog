DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose… in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump in the lower abdomen. And how long have you been aware of this mass, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably around six or seven weeks, I’d say. At first, I didn’t think much of it, honestly. Just figured it was something that would go away on its own. But it hasn’t, and it doesn’t feel like it’s going away, so I decided to make an appointment.
DOCTOR: Six to seven weeks. Alright. And has the size of the lump changed at all during that time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… it’s gotten a little bigger, I think. Not dramatically, but I definitely notice it more now than I did when I first found it. It’s also… sometimes feels a bit tender to the touch. Not painful, exactly, just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: I see. Growing in size and some tenderness. Now, can you describe the lump to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s sort of round, I think. Not perfectly round, more oval-shaped. And it feels… firm. Not rock hard, but not soft and squishy, either. It’s under the skin, definitely. I haven’t tried to measure it, if that makes sense. I just know it’s there, and it’s noticeable when I lie down.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And is there anything that makes it feel worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse. It doesn’t hurt when I move around or anything like that. Maybe… if I’m straining, like when I’m… well, when I’m using the bathroom, it feels a little more… present, if that makes sense. But it's not painful, just… more aware of it. Nothing makes it feel better that I've noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright, more noticeable with straining. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, I'm going to ask some broader questions, if that’s alright. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Changes in bowel habits… Let me think. Not really, no. Everything’s been pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that. Same as usual, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no blood in my stool. And I haven’t lost any weight, actually. If anything, I might have gained a little, but that's probably just… summer and enjoying good food with my wife. No, definitely no unexplained weight loss. I've been feeling alright energy-wise, too.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any similar lumps or bumps anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I do regular checks, if you know what I mean, and haven’t noticed anything else. Nothing new, no. I had a mole removed on my back about ten years ago, but that was checked out properly and it was fine. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, Mr. Raghunathan, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always double-checks, she’s very careful, and she hasn’t mentioned anything. I haven't had any reactions to anything the doctor has ever prescribed. I take a blood pressure medication, but that’s it. No allergies otherwise.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication. And what is the name of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I’ve been on it for about five years now, keeps everything stable. It's prescribed by my primary care doctor, Dr. El-Masri.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg. Good. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I understand. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start by palpating your abdomen, just to feel for the location and characteristics of the lump. I’ll be as gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if anything feels… off. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m going to press gently here, and then a little deeper. Just breathe normally. Hmm… Yes, I feel a firm, round mass approximately three centimeters in diameter, located in the left lower quadrant. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, but you may feel some discomfort. There is no rebound tenderness, and no guarding. Bowel sounds are normal in all quadrants. I don't feel any other abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. Three centimeters… that sounds about right, I suppose. It didn't really feel painful, but… yeah, I can feel you pressing on it. That’s… that’s where it is. Is that… is that concerning, Doctor? I'm sorry to ask, but my mind is already racing a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Raghunathan. It's natural to be anxious when you find something new. The fact that it’s firm and has grown somewhat is something we need to investigate further. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will help us look for any signs of infection or inflammation, and the CT scan will give us a more detailed view of the mass and the surrounding tissues. This will help us determine the most appropriate course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A blood test and a scan. That's… that's what I expected, I suppose. A little unsettling, but better to know, I guess. Will the scan… will it involve any radiation? My wife is a bit worried about that sort of thing. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this situation. We use the lowest possible dose necessary to get a clear image. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them and go over the next steps. I’ll also send the results to your primary care physician, Dr. El-Masri. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, you can continue with your normal activities. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and… calming, actually. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I will definitely contact you if anything changes. And I'll try not to worry too much until we have the results. When would be a good time to schedule the scan?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. As for the scan, our radiology department can usually accommodate appointments within the next 24 to 48 hours. Let me have my nurse, Fatima, schedule that for you before you leave. She will also give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan, which mainly involves drinking plenty of fluids. Do you have any dietary restrictions or allergies that I should be aware of before the scan?
PATIENT: No, no dietary restrictions or allergies. Everything’s fine. Just the usual blood pressure medication. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I think that’s everything for now. Please just let me know when Fatima is ready to schedule the scan.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Fatima will be with you shortly. She’s very efficient. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you. In the meantime, try to relax and take care of yourself.
