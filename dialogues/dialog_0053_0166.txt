DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Pitmon. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been feeling numb, off and on, for a little while now. Not constantly, but enough that it’s become noticeable, and a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Numbness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s… hard to describe exactly. Not like a complete loss of feeling, more like… pins and needles, sometimes. And other times it just feels… distant, you know? Like my leg isn’t quite there. It’s primarily in my right leg, from my thigh down to my foot. Though, occasionally I feel a slight tingling in my left leg as well, but it’s much less frequent and intense.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I believe, sometime in late June. So, about five or six weeks now, perhaps a little longer. At first, it was only after long periods of standing, like when I’m working on a set. But lately, it seems to happen even when I’m resting. Though, it is definitely worse after I’ve been on my feet all day. I can recall the exact date I first noticed it – June 24th, during the filming of a commercial down by the harbor.
DOCTOR: Okay, June 24th. That's helpful. And what kind of work do you do, Tarin?
PATIENT: I'm a special effects artist and animator, Doctor. So, a lot of standing, a lot of moving things around, setting up shots... sometimes a fair bit of lifting, though I try to avoid that when possible. It involves a lot of being on my feet for long stretches, and occasionally working in awkward positions to get the right angles for filming or animation. It’s… physically demanding, at times.
DOCTOR: Right, so quite active. Any recent injuries to your leg or back?
PATIENT: No sir, not that I recall. I haven’t had any falls or any particular incidents that would have caused an injury. I'm fairly careful with my movements on set, as you might imagine. Though… now that I think about it, I did strain my lower back a bit a couple of months ago, helping to move some equipment. It wasn’t a serious strain, just a bit of soreness that went away after a few days with some stretching. It wasn’t on June 24th, it was… April 18th, I believe. I can recall the specific date because it was the day after my cousin’s birthday. But I don’t believe that’s related to the numbness, as it healed completely.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Let's have a look at your back and leg then. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start with your back. I’m going to palpate along your spine and the surrounding muscles. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful.
PATIENT: Alright, I understand. It’s… a little tender right around here, Doctor. Not sharply painful, but definitely more sensitive than the surrounding area. And… perhaps a little bit here as well. Again, not severe, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A little tenderness there, on the left side. Nothing overtly alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Could you bend your knees, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’d like me to do with them? Or should I just keep them bent?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to test your reflexes. Relax your legs completely. And now, can you push your feet down against my hand like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Alright… I can push fairly strongly, Doctor, if that's what you'd like. I make sure to maintain consistent pressure throughout the test.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good strength there. And now, can you lift your leg straight up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I can lift it about… this high. It feels… a little tight, but not particularly painful. I can hold it here for a moment if you'd like.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, the left leg.
PATIENT: Here's my left leg, Doctor. That feels… similar to the right leg, perhaps a little easier. I can hold it here as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Both legs seem fairly equal in strength. Now, let’s do a quick sensory exam. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Alright, I understand. Yes… I feel that. And… that one as well. And… now that one. I believe I feel all of them, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sensitivity seems intact. Alright, Tarin, based on what I've found so far, it sounds like we’re likely dealing with some nerve compression, possibly related to the strain you mentioned in your back. It’s not immediately alarming, but it warrants further investigation. I'm going to order an MRI of your lower back to get a better look at the nerves and discs.
PATIENT: An MRI, Doctor? That sounds… thorough. Is that a standard procedure for something like this? And… what does it involve exactly? I confess, I’ve never had one before. Also, regarding the nerve compression… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime to alleviate the symptoms? Anything I should avoid? I want to ensure I'm not making it worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI is standard for evaluating potential nerve compression. It gives us a very detailed view of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, which is much better than just a physical exam. It involves lying on a table inside a large magnet. It's painless, but you'll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. You'll also be asked to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or watches. As for what you can do in the meantime… avoid any heavy lifting or twisting movements. Gentle stretching can be helpful, but stop if it causes pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage the discomfort. We can discuss stronger options if those aren’t sufficient after the MRI. And absolutely no strenuous activity, alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds… manageable, thankfully. No heavy lifting, gentle stretching, and over-the-counter pain relievers. I can certainly adhere to those guidelines. And removing metal objects for the MRI… that makes sense. I’ll be sure to ask if there are any specific precautions I should take beforehand, as well. Thank you for clarifying everything, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to have a clearer understanding of what’s going on, and what the next steps are. When can I expect to schedule the MRI?
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have my assistant schedule the MRI for you. They'll contact you within the next 24 hours with available dates and times. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Pitmon, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and have addressed all of my concerns. I appreciate your time and expertise. I'll await a call from your assistant regarding the MRI scheduling. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. Get plenty of rest and listen to your body. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as weakness, numbness that spreads, or loss of bowel or bladder control – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. You're welcome, Tarin. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I certainly will keep those symptoms in mind, and won't hesitate to seek immediate attention if they arise. And you have a good day as well. .
