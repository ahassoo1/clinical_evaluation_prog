DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tarin. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a 20-year-old male. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tarin. Numbness is definitely something we want to investigate. When you say "on and off," could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It doesn’t happen constantly, thankfully. It usually starts in my foot, and then kind of spreads up my leg, like… a tingling sensation first, and then it just feels… absent. It’s hard to describe. It's lasted anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours when it does happen. It seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been very active. Though, I’ve had it happen when I’m resting too, just… less frequently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes, affects your foot and leg, starts with tingling, then progresses to numbness, lasting minutes to hours. It’s exacerbated by standing and activity, but can occur at rest. That’s helpful information. Now, is this numbness on one leg or both?
PATIENT: It’s just in my right leg, Doctor. Only the right one. The left one feels perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t noticed anything off with it at all.
DOCTOR: Good. That narrows things down a bit. And have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No pain, not exactly. Sometimes there’s a slight weakness, like it's a little harder to lift my foot, but it’s very subtle. And occasionally, my right foot feels… colder than my left one. Not freezing, just… noticeably cooler. I haven’t thought much of it until now, though. I work with computers and animation a lot, so I'm often sitting for long stretches, which I suppose isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, some subtle weakness in foot lift, and a sensation of coolness in the right foot. The prolonged sitting is definitely something we’ll want to consider. Now, let’s go a little further back. Has this numbness been a gradual onset, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: It was definitely gradual, Doctor. I didn’t wake up one morning with it. It started maybe a couple of months ago, just a very faint tingling occasionally. I didn't really pay attention to it at first, honestly. It slowly got more noticeable, and then started happening more frequently, and now it’s… well, it's enough that I decided to come see you. It hasn’t gotten worse rapidly, but it’s definitely not going away on its own.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Tarin. A gradual onset is helpful. Now, have you experienced any recent injuries to your back, hip, or leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No recent injuries. I haven’t had any falls or anything like that. I’m fairly careful, and I don’t participate in any particularly risky activities. I do a bit of hiking occasionally, but nothing strenuous. As I said, I spend most of my time at a computer. I can’t recall any specific incident that might have caused this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been generally healthy, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized, and I don’t have any known allergies. I’m not currently taking any medications. My family history… my mother has some mild arthritis, but other than that, no major health concerns on either side. I’ve always been pretty active, though, as I mentioned, recently that’s been more limited to my work. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all very helpful, Tarin. Knowing there's no significant medical history, no allergies, and a generally healthy background is good. Now, would you be comfortable if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds fine. I'm happy to do whatever you need to figure out what's going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to start with a neurological assessment, checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. Then I’ll take a look at your feet and legs for any visible signs. First, could you please lie flat on your back?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, I’m going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs. Okay, and now the other side. Both reflexes are present and equal, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Could you try to push your heel down against my hand?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m trying my best. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. That feels strong. Now, can you pull your toes upwards, towards your shin?
PATIENT: Certainly. Like this? I can hold it for a bit, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good as well. Now, let’s check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Please tell me when you feel it. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that… and that one as well. I think I feel them all the same. Is that what you expected? Or should I let you know if it's different?
DOCTOR: That’s good, Tarin. Your sensation seems intact and equal on both sides. Now, let’s take a closer look at your feet. I don’t see any obvious swelling or redness. Your skin looks normal, and your pulses feel strong. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. And that doesn’t either. Everything feels… normal, as far as I can tell. Honestly, my foot looks perfectly fine. That's what's so frustrating about this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tarin. It can be concerning when the physical exam doesn’t immediately reveal a cause. Based on what you’ve told me, and my examination findings, the most likely explanation, at this point, is peripheral neuropathy, possibly related to prolonged sitting and compression of the nerves in your leg. However, to rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and diabetes, all of which can cause neuropathy. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation, including nerve conduction studies, which can help pinpoint the exact location and severity of the nerve compression. What are your thoughts on that plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’m happy to get the blood tests, and I’m willing to see a neurologist if that’s what you recommend. I'd rather be thorough. I haven't had any symptoms of diabetes or thyroid issues, but I understand that these things can sometimes present in unusual ways. So yes, I agree with your plan. What do I need to do to schedule the blood tests and the referral?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan, Tarin. I'll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. You can take that to any lab that accepts your insurance. As for the neurologist referral, my assistant will handle that for you. She'll schedule an appointment and contact you with the details. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting as much as possible. When you are sitting, try to take frequent breaks to stand up and walk around. Gentle stretching of your legs and feet may also help. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That's a very clear plan, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain it so thoroughly. I'll follow your recommendations and get the tests scheduled as soon as possible. Thank you for your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll follow up with you once we have the lab results. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
