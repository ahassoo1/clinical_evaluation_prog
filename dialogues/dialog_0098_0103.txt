DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it hurts. Lower back, mostly. Been hurting for a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It just… started. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but sometimes it gets sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower back that sometimes gets sharp. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… when would you say you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after I helped my daughter move some boxes. Big boxes! Maybe… three months ago? Something like that. It wasn’t bad right away, just a little sore. Then it just… didn’t get better. It got… more. More all the time. Not fast, you understand, just… steadily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started after helping your daughter move boxes about three months ago, and it’s been gradually worsening since then. And you’d describe it as a dull ache with sharper pains at times?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dull ache most of the time. But if I bend over, or try to lift something… oof. Then it’s a real sharp pain. Makes me stop right away. I try not to do too much, but… you know. Life happens. And the ache is always there, even when it's not sharp. It's just… annoying. Always reminding me. Doctor, do you think it's something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant ache with sharp pains when you move is certainly bothersome. It’s good you’re being mindful of your movements. It’s hard to say definitively without a bit more information, Mr. Vankampen, but we’ll work through it. To start, can you tell me if the pain radiates anywhere – does it go down your legs, or into your hips, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… sometimes it feels a little bit in my hips. Not all the time, just when it’s really bad. And maybe… a little bit down my left leg, but not like a shooting pain, more like… a heavy feeling. Not often though, just… sometimes. It’s mostly in my back. It feels like something is… stuck. Or broken, maybe? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain radiating to your hips and occasionally a heavy feeling down your left leg. And you describe it as feeling “stuck” or possibly broken. We'll need to investigate that feeling. Now, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Not that I've noticed. My feet feel alright. They get a little cold sometimes, but that's just… old age, I think! No, no numbness. Just the ache. And the pain when I bend over. That's it, really. Oh… and I get tired easier now, but I figured that's just getting old too. Is that… is that related, Doctor? Do you think?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear there’s no numbness or tingling. And you’re right to consider that fatigue could be related to age, but it’s always good to mention everything. We’ll consider all possibilities. Now, Mr. Vankampen, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter, she’s a nurse, she said something about my bones being… weak? She took me to a doctor a few years ago, because I fell and broke my wrist. He said something about osteoporosis. Is that… is that bad? I don't remember everything the doctor said. I just remember she worried a lot. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, but I take a pill for it. That’s it, I think. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that didn't bother me much. Does that help? Do you need to know more?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Osteoporosis and a history of high blood pressure are important to know. The osteoporosis especially, given your back pain and the wrist fracture. And the gallbladder removal is noted. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. A little white pill. Just one, every morning. My daughter makes sure I take it. She worries a lot, she does. She says it's important. I think it's… Lisinopril? Is that right? Something like that. She handles all my paperwork, so I don't remember the exact name. I'm not very good with remembering names, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Vankampen. Lisinopril is correct, and it's good you're taking it regularly. It’s wonderful you have such a caring daughter. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a problem with any medicine. I can eat anything, too. Shellfish, nuts… everything. My daughter always asks, but I always say no. I'm very lucky that way. No allergies. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, I'd like to do a quick physical examination to assess your back and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to figure out what’s wrong with my back. Just… be gentle, please? It hurts, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. We'll take it slow. Please lie down on your stomach on the examination table. I’m going to start by feeling along your spine to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, I'm feeling some tenderness along your lower lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. There doesn't appear to be any obvious deformity or muscle spasm. Now, I’m going to have you gently try to bend forward, backward, and side to side to assess your range of motion. Let me know if anything causes significant pain.
PATIENT: Okay. This is… not very comfortable. Okay, bending… Ooh! That… that hurts. Just a little bit. I can't go much further. That’s… that’s bad. Is that normal, Doctor? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know. It’s alright to stop. It’s not normal for it to cause that much pain, which confirms that there's likely some underlying issue causing the discomfort. Okay, let’s try bending backward now, very gently, and let me know if you feel any pain. We'll take it extremely slow.
PATIENT: Okay… That’s… uncomfortable, but not terrible. It’s more of a stretch, I think. A little bit sore, but I can do that. Not as bad as bending forward, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Alright, let’s try bending side to side now, again very gently. Let me know if anything causes significant pain.
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh! That one hurts too. Not as bad as bending forward, but still… unpleasant. And now to the left… That’s a little better, but still sore. I think my left side is the bad one, Doctor. Definitely. It hurts more on that side.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vankampen. That’s very helpful. Based on the physical exam, you have tenderness and limited range of motion in your lower lumbar spine, with more pain on your left side. It is consistent with a muscle strain or possibly a disc issue, but given your history of osteoporosis, we need to investigate further to rule out a compression fracture. I’d like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lumbar spine to start, and potentially an MRI if the X-ray is inconclusive. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and maybe an MRI? Is that… is that expensive? My daughter always worries about the bills. I don’t have… much money, you understand. And is it… dangerous? All those machines? I just want to know what’s wrong with my back, but I don’t want to cause any more problems.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Vankampen. Those are very valid questions. The X-ray is relatively inexpensive and uses very low levels of radiation – it’s a standard imaging test. An MRI is more expensive, but it gives us a much more detailed look at the soft tissues in your back. We can start with the X-ray and see what that shows. If we need the MRI, we can discuss options for financial assistance at that time. Your daughter is right to be mindful of the bills, and we'll do everything we can to keep costs down. As for danger, the machines are very safe. We take all necessary precautions to minimize any risk. It’s important to get a proper diagnosis so we can start you on the right treatment plan, and the imaging will help us do that. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… an X-ray first. That sounds… reasonable. As long as it's not too expensive. And if we need the MRI later, we can talk about the money then. Yes, that’s fine. What do I need to do? Do I need to make an appointment? And will you tell me what the results mean? I don't understand all that medical talk, you know. My daughter usually explains it to me.
DOCTOR: Perfect. That’s a very good plan. I'll write you a referral for an X-ray. You can schedule an appointment at the radiology department – I'll give you their number on your way out. They'll give you specific instructions about preparation, but usually, it’s just avoiding wearing any metal jewelry. As for the results, I will absolutely explain everything to you in plain language. I understand medical jargon can be confusing, and I'll make sure you fully understand what's going on. And if you’d like, you are welcome to bring your daughter with you to the appointment so she can help, too. Once we get the X-ray results, we can discuss treatment options – which could include pain medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Physical therapy… that might be helpful. My muscles are always sore. And yes, I think I will bring my daughter. She's good at asking questions. Yes, bring my daughter. That’s a good idea. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could help. Here is the referral for the X-ray. It also has the radiology department’s number. I’ve also made a note to have the results sent to me directly. Once I have them, my staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your pain suddenly worsens or you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions, Doctor. Thank you again for being so patient and explaining everything so clearly. It’s… it’s a relief to have a plan. And tell your staff to call my daughter, please. She handles the phone calls. Her name is Layla Vankampen. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could ease your worries. I’ll make sure my staff knows to contact Layla. Please, take care, and don’t hesitate to call us if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day to you as well.
