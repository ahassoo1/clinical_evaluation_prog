DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. I'm Dr. Trestrail. It says here you're 86 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, 86, bless my soul, time flies, doesn’t it? I’m here about these hiccups. They’ve been going on for… well, a good little while now, and they’re just not stopping. It’s a bit embarrassing, really!
DOCTOR: “A good little while”... could you be a bit more specific, Mrs. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… let me think. It started… maybe three days ago? Possibly four. It's hard to keep track when you’re constantly hic! jumping. It's not constant, mind you. Comes and goes, but it’s enough to be a nuisance, especially at night. It woke me up twice last night, poor dear husband would’ve been annoyed if he was still here! hic! Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Three or four days… and it’s interfering with sleep. Any particular triggers you've noticed?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. I was gardening yesterday, a bit of bending and stretching, but I garden all the time! hic! And I had a nice cup of tea with my daughter, but I drink tea every day too. I even tried holding my breath, like you always see in the movies, but that just made me feel a bit dizzy! hic! Honestly, it seems to happen randomly.
DOCTOR: Random, alright. And have you experienced anything else alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Alongside the hiccups… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been feeling… well, my age, you know? A little tired sometimes, but that’s nothing new. My appetite's been a little off, maybe eating a bit less, but I put that down to the heat we’ve been having. Oh! And my stomach feels a bit… bubbly sometimes. Like there’s air in there. But that could just be the tea, couldn’t it? hic! It's just… frustrating, really. They won’t stop!
DOCTOR: "A bit off," and "a bit bubbly." Right. Are you experiencing any pain, Mrs. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no pain at all, dear. Not a bit! Just uncomfortable. It's like having a little bird flapping around inside your chest, you know? hic! It's not hurting, it's just… startling. And a little bit annoying when I’m trying to have a conversation! I don't want to be a bother, you see. hic! My daughter said I should come in, but I hate making a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. hic! Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind? My ribs aren’t quite as sturdy as they used to be! hic! And please, don’t be alarmed if I jump! It's entirely involuntary, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not a bit! hic! Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little gurgly, maybe, but that's probably the tea again. It’s a bit tender right here though, sometimes. Not painful, but… sensitive. Like when you’ve had a good laugh and your tummy aches a bit afterwards. hic! It’s nothing major, I assure you. I’ve had a good life, you know, plenty of bumps and bruises along the way! hic!
DOCTOR: Tenderness… yes, I feel that. Mild, but present. And you said you’ve been eating less?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not a lot less, mind you, but maybe… half a plate less than usual. I haven't been feeling quite as hungry. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more, makes lovely soups and stews, but sometimes I just can’t finish it. It’s not that it doesn’t taste good, it just… sits heavy, you know? hic! And then the hiccups start up again. hic! It's a vicious cycle, really. It’s just… wearing me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sucich, given your age, the duration of the hiccups, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen, I want to order some blood work. We need to check your electrolyte levels, rule out any underlying inflammation, and assess your overall health. We’ll also do a chest X-ray, just to be thorough. It's possible it's nothing serious, but we need to investigate.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. Blood work and an X-ray… That sounds… serious. hic! But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? hic! I haven't had an X-ray in… goodness, I don’t even remember! Will it be very uncomfortable? hic! And how long will it take to get the results? hic! I just hope it’s not anything too awful. My daughter would be so worried.
DOCTOR: The blood work is straightforward, just a few vials drawn. The X-ray is painless, you'll just need to stand still for a moment. The results usually take a couple of days, but I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re in. Here are the forms. The nurse will assist you with scheduling the tests. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to try and help with the hiccups. It's Baclofen, a muscle relaxant. It sometimes helps quiet the diaphragm. We'll re-evaluate once we have the test results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… well, it sounds like a plan. hic! Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant. That makes sense, I suppose, if it’s my diaphragm that’s being troublesome. hic! Yes, I'm happy to try that. And I’ll let the nurse know I'm ready to schedule the tests. hic! Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, even if it is just a little. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. hic! I just hope it doesn't interact with my tea! hic! Is there any reason I should avoid tea while taking this medicine?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sucich, while I admire your dedication to tea, it’s unlikely to directly interact with Baclofen. However, caffeine can sometimes exacerbate muscle spasms. So, reducing your intake while we assess the medication's effectiveness would be prudent. And frankly, given the situation, it’s a small sacrifice. We need to focus on ruling out anything serious first. Let’s not complicate matters with unnecessary variables. The nurse will go over the medication instructions in detail, but it's important to take it exactly as prescribed. Any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reducing the tea, then. hic! It will be a challenge, I can assure you. But if it helps… hic! No, I don’t think so, dear. You've explained everything very clearly. I just hope this medicine works. hic! It's awfully distracting, you know, having these hiccups all the time. hic! It makes it hard to concentrate, and harder still to enjoy a nice chat. hic! Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll let the nurse know I’m ready whenever she is. hic! I suppose I should go and try to schedule those tests, then? hic! It's a bit overwhelming, all of a sudden, but I’m grateful for your help. hic!
DOCTOR: Yes, scheduling the tests is the next step. The nurse is already aware. Do try to relax, Mrs. Sucich. And remember, reducing your tea intake. .
