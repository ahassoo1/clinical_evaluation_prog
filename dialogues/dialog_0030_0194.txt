DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… what brings me in… It’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble. A bit of a spinning feeling sometimes, and the hearing… it just goes. Comes and goes, you know? And my… my husband, bless his soul, he had something similar. That’s why I wanted to get it checked. It’s all a bit fuzzy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some dizziness and fluctuating hearing in both ears, and you’re understandably concerned given your husband’s history. That's perfectly valid. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this spinning feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Spinning… it's not constant, thankfully. More like… waves, you know? It comes on suddenly, and then it’s gone. Sometimes it's just a bit of unsteadiness, not a full spin. It happens when I stand up quickly, I think, or maybe when I turn my head… I’m not always sure. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes. And then everything feels normal again… until the next time. Honestly, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it happens. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry if I’m being vague.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh, don’t apologize at all. It's common for these things to be a bit difficult to describe and pinpoint. The fact that it’s intermittent and triggered by changes in position – like standing or turning your head – gives me some initial ideas. Could you tell me a bit more about your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing… It just… fades. Like someone turned down the volume. Usually in one ear, but sometimes both. It doesn’t hurt, just… quiet. And then it comes back, sometimes quickly, sometimes it takes a little while. It's unsettling, you know? Especially when you're talking to someone and you can’t hear properly. I find myself asking people to repeat themselves a lot. It happens randomly, I suppose. Not after anything specific. I don’t think so, anyway. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fluctuating hearing loss along with the dizziness is certainly something we need to investigate. And it’s good you’ve noticed it’s intermittent. Now, to get a fuller picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, for a while. The doctor put me on medication for it, and it seemed to help. And arthritis, in my knees mostly. It aches a bit, especially when the weather is cold. Other than that… not much comes to mind. My husband used to handle all the doctor’s appointments, so I wasn’t always fully aware of everything. I’m on Medicare now, of course. Is that helpful? I really don’t remember much beyond that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and arthritis are good to know. And it's perfectly alright that you don’t recall everything. We can go at your pace. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I was in the hospital once, when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly thing. But that was a long time ago, before my husband… passed. Other than that, I don’t think so. Nothing major, I’m fairly sure. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more precise. Everything feels so… distant now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. You’ve given me some very helpful information already. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the wrist fracture is good to have. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you’re comfortable sharing that. Has anyone in your family experienced similar issues with dizziness or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's why I came! My husband, bless his soul, he had… well, the doctor called it Meniere’s disease, I think. Something to do with the inner ear. He had the spinning spells, and the hearing loss. It was awful to watch. And his mother, she had something similar too, I remember her talking about it. It ran in her family, apparently. I'm not sure about anyone else, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. Is that… useful? I’m trying to remember everything I can.
DOCTOR: That’s very useful indeed, Ms. Mayhugh. Your husband’s history of Meniere’s disease, and his mother’s similar symptoms, are important pieces of the puzzle. It certainly raises the possibility that this could be what’s going on with you as well. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications, other than those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… for the blood pressure, yes, I take Lisinopril. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they're really aching. That's about it, I think. Nothing else regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen. And sometimes a little something for sleep, if I’m having trouble, but not very often. It’s just a small dose, I promise. I don't like taking too many pills. Is that… all you need to know? I’m starting to feel a bit tired, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Mayhugh. Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed, and occasionally something for sleep. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. Not that I know of, thankfully. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I get a bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but that's just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, actually. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m afraid my mind is starting to wander a bit. I really do appreciate you taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Mayhugh. No known allergies. Thank you for answering all my questions. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look in your ears and check your balance and coordination. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet, so please be gentle. And if I seem a bit… distracted, it’s not you. It's just my memory, you know. I’m ready whenever you are. I just hope this gives us some answers.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. We'll take things slowly. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. Your ear canals have a little earwax, but your eardrums look normal. Now, I'll check your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Oh dear… I'm not very good at this, am I? It’s a bit wobbly. I feel a bit dizzy already, actually. Should I open my eyes? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly okay. Please open your eyes. It's common to feel unsteady when you close your eyes, and it's important to prioritize your safety. That confirms some imbalance. Now, I'll do a quick Romberg test. Could you stand with your feet together, close your eyes again, and extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… another test? Oh… they're… wobbly. I can’t keep them straight. Everything feels… swirly. Could I sit down now, please? I really don't feel very well. This is making me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. Please sit down. And you're doing perfectly fine. We’ve gathered enough information for now. It's important to listen to your body, and it sounds like this is making you uncomfortable. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, your symptoms – the dizziness, fluctuating hearing loss, and imbalance – along with your husband’s history of Meniere’s disease, raise a strong suspicion of a vestibular issue, potentially Meniere’s disease itself. However, it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. Other possibilities need to be ruled out. I would like to order some additional tests to help clarify the cause of your symptoms. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Anything that might help. I just want to know what's happening, and hopefully, something can be done about it. Tests are fine. As long as they're not too… strenuous. I’m not very good at standing, as you’ve noticed. What kind of tests are you thinking? Will they take long? I have a bit of a doctor’s appointment next week, and I’d like to know if I need to reschedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I understand your concerns. The tests I'm thinking of are primarily hearing tests, called an audiogram, and a test called a VNG – videonystagmography. It assesses your inner ear balance function. It doesn’t involve anything strenuous – mostly looking at moving objects while wearing goggles. The audiogram is a simple hearing test. Both tests can be completed in about an hour or so. They don’t require any special preparation. We can schedule them at the clinic’s audiology department. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel to rule out any electrolyte imbalances that could be contributing to your symptoms. That will require a blood draw. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. That would be wonderful. The sooner the better, really. And a blood draw is fine, as long as it doesn’t take too long. I don’t like needles much, but I suppose it has to be done. And the audiogram and the… VNG, is it? I’ll manage those as well. Can you schedule them for next week, if possible? I have a hairdresser’s appointment on Friday, so not then. Perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday? And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any precautions I need to take? I’m a bit worried about falling, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I’ve scheduled you for an audiogram and VNG on Tuesday afternoon, and a blood draw for Wednesday morning. In the meantime, to minimize the risk of falling, I recommend using a cane or walker if you feel unsteady, particularly in dimly lit areas. Avoid sudden movements, and make sure your home is free of tripping hazards – rugs, cords, etc. It’s also best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have a better understanding of your condition. I’ll also prescribe a medication to help with any acute dizziness or nausea you might experience. It’s called Meclizine. It’s a common anti-motion sickness medication, and it can help alleviate some of the spinning sensation. However, it can cause drowsiness, so be cautious when taking it. I’ll send the prescriptions to your pharmacy. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very thoughtful, Doctor. Meclizine… I’ll ask my pharmacist about it. And I’ll definitely be careful with the falling. A cane might be a good idea, actually. I haven’t used one before, but it's better to be safe than sorry. And… no, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m still a bit worried, of course, but I feel a bit better knowing that we’re getting things sorted out. Thank you again. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? A follow-up appointment, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your worries. Yes, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, once the test results are back, to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does the afternoon of August 16th work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 16th is fine. The afternoon would be perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I really do appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s been… a bit overwhelming, but I feel much more reassured now. I’ll see you on August 16th, then. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Here's your paperwork with the prescriptions and test orders. Have a good day as well, and please be careful.
PATIENT: .
