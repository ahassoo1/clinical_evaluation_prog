DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I've been feeling rather…unsettled, lately. I’m excessively thirsty, and hungry, all the time. It’s quite bothersome, actually. I was hoping you could have a look at it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Excessive thirst and hunger can certainly be disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been…oh, I’d say about a month now, maybe a little longer. It didn't come on suddenly, more of a gradual increase, if that makes sense. I just kept feeling more and more thirsty, even after drinking plenty, and then the hunger started following shortly after. It’s just…constant, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over about a month. And you said constant thirst and hunger. Have you noticed any changes in your weight – either a gain or a loss – during this time?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't been keeping particularly close track. I… I suppose I haven’t felt any different in terms of how my clothes fit, but I haven’t stood on the scales recently, if that makes sense. I’m divorced, and…well, let’s just say maintaining routines isn't my strongest suit these days. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Erxleben. It's very common for things to slip when life changes. No need to apologize. So, no noticeable weight change, as far as you can tell. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, amount, or color, perhaps?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I have been going to the toilet more often. Especially at night, which is a nuisance, naturally. And… I suppose the colour is a bit lighter than usual, now that I think about it. I hadn’t really connected the two, but you’re right, it has been happening more. Does that…mean something?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful information. Increased urination, particularly at night, and lighter urine color can be significant. Along with the thirst and hunger, it does raise certain possibilities. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as blurred vision, fatigue, or any unexplained weight loss, even if you haven't been weighing yourself?
PATIENT: Blurred vision… now that you mention it, I’ve been needing to adjust my glasses more often lately. I just put it down to getting older, to be honest. And fatigue… well, who isn’t tired these days? But yes, I’ve felt a bit more run down than usual, I suppose. Nothing drastic, mind you, but certainly not my usual energy levels. Weight loss… no, I don't think so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. Is this sounding…serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're sharing all of this with me, Mr. Erxleben. Based on what you’ve described—increased thirst, frequent urination, blurry vision, and fatigue—it does suggest the possibility of diabetes. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam and then order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh. Right. Well, that doesn't sound ideal. My… my father had that, actually. Yes, a blood test sounds sensible. Absolutely. Let’s get that done, please. The sooner we know one way or another, the better, I suppose. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Stop drinking fluids, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No, please don't stop drinking fluids. Staying hydrated is important. We'll need an accurate urine sample as well, so try not to drastically change your fluid intake. Okay, let’s start with the physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then do a quick neurological exam. We'll also check your feet – it's a standard part of the assessment, especially when considering diabetes. Then we’ll head over to the lab for the blood work. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. The more thorough, the better, I say. I'll cooperate fully. Though…checking my feet? Is that…necessary? I haven’t really paid much attention to them lately. It’s just…not something I routinely do, if you understand. But if it’s part of the process… certainly. Lead the way. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of the exam, Mr. Erxleben. Diabetes can sometimes affect circulation and nerve function in the feet, so it's important to check for any subtle changes. It’s a preventative measure, really. Alright, if you could please sit up on the exam table, and remove your shoes and socks, we'll get started.
PATIENT: Right, of course. Preventative measures. That makes sense. Here we are, Doctor. Please proceed when you're ready. I'll try to remain as still as possible. I just...hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Erxleben. No need to worry just yet. We're simply gathering information. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, then check your blood pressure. Breathing normally, please. Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds normal. Now, your lungs sound clear. I'm going to inflate this cuff around your arm. It will feel a bit tight for a moment. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, 140 over 90. Now, let’s take a quick look at your feet. Can you point your toes and flex your ankles for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is this alright? I haven't done this in…well, a long time. It feels a bit stiff, if I’m honest. Everything feels a bit stiff these days. I hope I’m not making this difficult for you. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making it difficult at all, Mr. Erxleben. It’s perfectly normal for things to feel a bit stiff, especially if they haven’t been exercised regularly. I’m checking the sensation in your feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this light touch?
PATIENT: Hmm…yes, I think so. Very faintly. It’s… a bit like a tickle, perhaps? It’s not particularly strong, though. More of a vague awareness than a definite feeling. Is that…bad? I'm starting to get a little worried, Doctor. Are you finding something concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Erxleben, but it’s something we need to note. Reduced sensation can be a sign of nerve damage, which, as we discussed, can sometimes be associated with diabetes. I’m just comparing it to the other foot now. Okay, the sensation seems slightly reduced in both feet, but a little more pronounced in the right foot. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes…right. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm prepared. I hope I don't flinch. I'm not very good with sudden movements, if I’m honest. Everything feels a bit…slow these days, if you understand. I’m probably just getting old. Is this…normal for someone my age? Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Erxleben. No need to worry about flinching. We’re just gathering information. The reflexes are a little diminished, but again, not dramatically so. It could be normal variation, but it’s another piece of the puzzle. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. It's time to head over to the lab for the blood work. We’ll need to check your blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and kidney function. Do you think you can walk alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can walk perfectly fine. A little stiff, perhaps, but perfectly capable. Lead the way. I'm ready whenever you are. I just…hope this isn't too serious. I really don't want to have to deal with all that nonsense, if I'm honest. What are the chances it's something else? Something…simpler?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Mr. Erxleben. We won't know for sure until we have the blood test results. There are other possibilities, of course. It could be dehydration, a thyroid issue, or even a side effect of medication. However, based on the symptoms you've described and what I found during the exam, it’s best to rule out diabetes first. The lab technician will just need a small sample of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and come up with a plan. Here we are. The technician, Sarah, is expecting us.
PATIENT: Right. Sarah, you say? Very well. I suppose there's no avoiding it, then. I always hated needles. Is it going to be a big one? I hope it doesn't hurt too much. And will I have to fast afterwards? I had a rather large breakfast, I must admit. I should probably have thought of that beforehand.
DOCTOR: It won’t be a big needle, Mr. Erxleben, just a standard blood draw. And it shouldn’t hurt too much. Most people only feel a quick pinch. As for fasting, no, you don’t need to fast afterwards. We drew blood after you'd had breakfast, so the results will give us a baseline. Sarah will explain everything as she goes. Sarah, this is Mr. Erxleben. He’s here for a blood sugar test and some routine blood work. Just relax, and let Sarah do her work. It will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Right. Sarah, you say? A pleasure to meet you. I must confess, I'm not a fan of needles, but I'll do my best. Please…be gentle? And perhaps tell me what you're doing as you go, to distract me? I find that helps. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
