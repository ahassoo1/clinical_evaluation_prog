DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again. Keeps coming back, you see. And with it, these…water infections. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: "Pain in side, recurrent, with water infections…" Right. And by "water infections," do you mean urinary tract infections, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Urinary tract infections. That's what the doctor back home called them. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, having to keep going back about it. But it’s quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all, Mr. Espinueva. These things happen, and we're here to help. Can you tell me more about this pain?
PATIENT: It’s usually on my right side, sort of…under my ribs, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a dull ache, other times it’s a sharp, stabbing pain. It can last for a few hours, then disappear for a while. And then it comes back. It seems to flare up when I drink a lot of fluids, strangely enough.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Flares with increased fluid intake… That is unusual. Can you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain you've ever experienced, when it's at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm…at its worst? I'd say a seven, maybe an eight. It doesn't knock me off my feet, but it’s enough to make me lie down and take it easy. It's not a pain I'd wish on anyone, that’s for sure. And then, of course, the burning when I…well, when I go to the toilet. That’s not nice either.
DOCTOR: Seven to eight, accompanied by dysuria… Right. And how often would you say you’re experiencing these urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. It feels like every couple of months, at least. Sometimes sooner. I’ve lost track, to be honest. The doctor back home said something about my kidneys…something about lots of little cysts? I can’t quite remember the details. It was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Cysts… Okay. Do you have any records from that doctor, perhaps a summary of your medical history?
PATIENT: I think I do. There's a folder with some old papers and things at home. My daughter helps me with those sorts of things. She usually brings them when I go to see the doctor, but I came on my own this time. I’m not sure if she included everything. Would it be helpful if I asked her to send them to you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Espinueva, that would be very helpful. Having those records would give me a clearer picture. In the meantime, let’s go through some other things. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes. Not a lot, just a bit of pinkish tinge. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s been there a few times, especially when the pain is bad. It worries me a bit, to be honest. I always hope it’s just from the infection, but…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Pinkish tinge with exacerbations…Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting associated with these infections or the pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever that I've noticed. Maybe a little bit tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age, you know? No chills or sickness, thankfully. Just the pain and the…discomfort. It's mostly the pain, really. It just wears you down, after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh? My bowel movements? Well, they’re…regular enough. I have a cup of tea in the morning, usually helps things along. No problems there, no. Why do you ask, Doctor? Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: I'm just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Espinueva. Sometimes pain in that area can be referred from other sources. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. My appetite's always been a bit small, to be honest. I don’t eat as much as I used to. And I haven't noticed losing any weight, no. My clothes still fit the same, anyway. I’m a bit…thin, always have been. But no sudden changes, no. It’s just this pain, really. It's the main worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Aside from what you mentioned about the cysts, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor back home said my kidneys weren't working as well as they should be, because of those cysts. He said it was something I’d have to manage. Aside from that…no, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been under control with medication. Nothing else serious, thankfully. I try to stay as healthy as I can, you know? I walk a little every day, and try to eat well.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Let me see... it's a little white pill. My daughter refills it for me. I think it's called…amlodipine? Yes, that's it. Amlodipine, five milligrams, once a day. And that’s it, really. Just that and a bit of paracetamol when the pain gets bad. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. Never had any problems with allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most pills…except for that one time when I got a funny rash from some antibiotic years ago. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember what it was called. It wasn't serious, just a bit itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife…well, my late wife, she used to smoke, but I always stayed away from it. It never appealed to me. Always thought it was a silly habit. And no, I don’t drink much alcohol either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my mother had trouble with her kidneys when she got older. She didn’t live a very long life, unfortunately. And my father…he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing else that I can recall, really. My siblings were all quite healthy, as far as I know. It’s been a while since I saw them, though. We don’t keep in touch as much these days. It’s just me, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you would, my side’s a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out… Okay… a little tenderness there on the right side, as you mentioned. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen is soft otherwise. I am also checking for any masses... I'm not feeling any obvious masses. Your pulses are good, and there's no edema in your legs. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and blood in your urine, as we discussed. And I think a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel would be helpful to get a better picture of your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Anything you think is best, I'm happy to do. A urinalysis and those blood tests…go ahead. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain, you know? It’s been bothering me for a long time now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Espinueva. We will get to the bottom of it. I’m also going to order a renal ultrasound to take a look at your kidneys and see if we can get a better understanding of what’s going on with those cysts. It's a painless imaging test. The lab will draw your blood now, and then we can get you scheduled for the urinalysis and ultrasound. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A renal ultrasound... alright. No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just... how long will it take to get the results? I'm not one for waiting around, if you know what I mean. I just want to know what's going on and get it sorted. Hopefully, it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis results usually come back within a few hours. The blood test results typically take 24 to 48 hours, and the ultrasound may take a few days to schedule and then another few days for the radiologist to interpret the images. So, it may take up to a week to have a complete picture. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Espinueva, and I will let you know as soon as I have any results. Given your recurrent UTIs and pain, we will proceed with caution. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water a day, unless you have any medical conditions that restrict fluid intake. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, and continue to take the paracetamol for pain relief as needed. If you develop a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, or if your pain worsens significantly, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. More water, no caffeine or alcohol, and keep taking the paracetamol. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. I can do all that. Thank you. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I appreciate your time, Doctor. .
