DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It's just... my blood pressure's been actin' up. Been high, the nurse said. That’s why I'm here, I reckon. Don’t rightly know much about it, just know it ain’t good.
DOCTOR: I see. High blood pressure, or hypertension as we call it, is definitely something we want to take a look at. It often doesn’t have many symptoms, which is why regular check-ups are so important. Could you tell me when you first noticed your blood pressure being high, or when your nurse first mentioned it to you?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It was...oh, about a month ago, maybe a little more. The nurse at the pharmacy did a check when I was pickin’ up my usual medicine, and she said I ought to see a doctor. She seemed a little worried, so I figured I best come in. I don’t usually bother doctors much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. And what medicine were you picking up at the pharmacy, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just somethin’ for my arthritis, mostly. Gets bad in my hands and knees, especially when the weather’s turnin’. Been takin’ it for…oh, goodness, must be ten years now, maybe more. A little white pill. Don't rightly recall the name. Old age, ya know? Things slip yer mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Many medications can interact with blood pressure, so it's helpful to know what you're taking. Let me just pull up your record here… Ah, yes, I see you’ve been on meloxicam for osteoarthritis. Thank you. Now, besides the arthritis, have you been feeling any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Meloxicam, that’s the one! Yes, that's right. And no, not really… nothin’ different, anyways. I get tired easy, but I always have. And my ankles swell up a bit when it’s hot, but that's just normal for me, I figure. Nothin’ to worry about. Just old age again, I suppose. Everything aches and creaks, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to distinguish what’s new versus what’s been going on for a while. When you say your ankles swell, is that at the end of the day, or consistently throughout the day?
PATIENT: Mostly at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet a bit. I do a little bakin' still, ya see. Folks around town like my pies and bread. But standin’ for too long…well, my feet just give out, and my ankles puff up like balloons. It goes down when I lay down and put 'em up.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. It sounds like that swelling may be related to prolonged standing, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. My chest feels alright, thankfully. I can breathe fine, and my head’s clear enough. Though I do need my readin’ glasses now, been needin' 'em for a good while. Vision ain't what it used to be, but that's just...gettin' old! Everything's blurry if I don't have 'em on, but I don't see any changes, if that makes sense. Just regular old age blurriness.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Alright. And have you been noticing any changes in your urination – like needing to go more often, or having difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it... I have been gettin’ up a couple more times at night lately. Just once or twice, mind you. But more than usual. I just figured it was somethin' I ate. Or maybe too much tea before bed. Didn’t think much of it. Old bladder, ya know? Things don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re so observant of these changes. It's helpful for me to have a complete picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. Just get it over with, if ya please. I got a pie crust needin’ rollin’ later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your pulse is a bit fast, at 88, but that can be due to a number of things. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles. I do notice some slight swelling in your ankles, and when I press on them, there's a little indentation that lingers for a moment. That's what we call pitting edema. It's consistent with what you've described, but it’s something we want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Pitting edema, ya say? Sounds fancy. Is it bad? I don’t like fancy words. Is it somethin' I need to worry about? I just wanna get back to bakin', if ya don't mind. Folks are countin’ on my cherry pie for the picnic tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something to panic about right away, Ms. Steines, but it is something we need to understand. Pitting edema simply means fluid is accumulating in your tissues. It can be caused by a variety of things – your heart, kidneys, liver, or even just prolonged standing. Given your history of high blood pressure and the swelling, I'd like to order a few blood tests and a urine test to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Well, I reckon I can’t argue with that. If ya think it’s best, go ahead. Just try not to take too much blood, alright? I get lightheaded easy, ya know. And if ya could hurry it up a bit...that pie crust ain't gonna roll itself.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. We’ll take only what’s necessary, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist knows to be gentle. Okay, I’ve ordered a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel which checks your kidney function and electrolytes, a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol, and a Urinalysis. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. While we wait for the results, I’m going to start you on a low dose of a medication called lisinopril. It’s a type of blood pressure medicine that can also help reduce fluid buildup. It's generally well-tolerated, but it can sometimes cause a slight cough or dizziness. We will monitor you closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, ya say? More pills… Always somethin', ain’t it? A slight cough… well, I cough a little already, so it probably won’t make much difference. Dizziness… that’s what I was worried about. I don't need to be fallin’ over, especially not with a pie crust needin’ rollin’. But if ya think it’s best, go ahead. Just… be careful with the dose, alright? And tell me what I need to watch out for. I ain’t one for fancy symptoms. Just tell me plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. We will start with a very low dose, 5 milligrams, and monitor your blood pressure closely. In plain and simple terms, please watch out for feeling lightheaded or dizzy, especially when you stand up quickly. If you experience that, sit down immediately. Also, if you develop a persistent cough that doesn’t go away, or any swelling in your face or tongue, please call the office right away. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check your blood pressure and review the test results. The nurse will give you written instructions before you leave. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Lightheaded, dizzy, cough, swelling… I can remember that. And a follow-up next week. Just… don’t make me come back too often. I got pies to bake, ya know. So… can I go now? That pie crust ain't gonna roll itself, and folks are expectin’ cherry pie. I reckon I’ve wasted enough time already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. You've been very patient, and I appreciate you coming in today. The nurse will be in shortly to finalize everything and give you your prescriptions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I hope your cherry pie turns out wonderfully! It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: .
