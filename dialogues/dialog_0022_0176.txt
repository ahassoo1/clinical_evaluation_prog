DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… these hiccups. They just won’t stop. I’ve had them for two days now, and it’s getting really annoying. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing too.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for two days. That can be frustrating. And yes, I understand how it can be a bit embarrassing. Let's try to figure out what's going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… they started right after I was helping set up for the summer festival – lots of lifting boxes, moving tables, that sort of thing. They come and go, but they’re pretty frequent, especially if I try to talk or drink something. It feels like… a normal hiccup, I guess? Just a sudden jerk in my chest and then hic there it is. It hasn't gotten worse, thankfully, just… persistent. I tried holding my breath a few times, like my grandmother used to tell me, but that doesn’t seem to be doing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started after some physical exertion – lifting and moving things at the festival. And they’re triggered by talking or drinking. You’ve already tried the holding-your-breath maneuver. Good to know. Now, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything, no fever, no stomach pain. I’m a little tired, maybe, but that’s probably just from being busy with the festival planning. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, my chest does feel a little… tight sometimes, but it's not painful. Just a bit uncomfortable. Like I haven't taken a deep breath in a while. It comes and goes, like the hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no stomach pain, just some fatigue from the festival and this occasional tightness in your chest. That's helpful. And just to clarify – is this chest tightness constant, or does it seem to happen around the same time as the hiccups, or is it separate?
PATIENT: It definitely seems to happen more when I’m hiccuping, or right before. It's not a constant thing, thankfully. If I wasn’t hiccuping, I wouldn’t even notice it most of the time. It’s just… a little pressure, like someone is sitting on my chest, but very mild. And it goes away quickly. It’s not like a proper pain, more… an awareness. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You're describing a mild, intermittent chest tightness that correlates with the hiccups. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, heart problems, or GERD?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but nothing serious. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but I haven’t had any issues with that myself. I don’t really take any medications regularly, just over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about fifteen years ago. And I don't drink alcohol very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, no diagnosed conditions. Mother had high blood pressure. You quit smoking fifteen years ago, and you drink alcohol infrequently. That's good information. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past. I’m a little sensitive to dust sometimes, but it’s just a mild sneeze, nothing serious. My skin can get a bit itchy in the sun, but I always use sunscreen. I don’t have any food allergies that I’m aware of either. I eat pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's excellent. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general check of your chest wall. It will only take a few minutes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s making me hiccup like this! It’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. And this doesn’t seem to be causing any pain, right?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt, just… feels a little sensitive, maybe? But not pain. It's hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… an awareness of pressure. Like I said before, a mild tightness. It’s more noticeable when I’m thinking about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, mild sensitivity on palpation, particularly when you're focusing on it. Given your history and the exam findings – no fever, clear lungs, regular heart rate, no significant pain, and this mild sensitivity associated with the hiccups – it's possible this is related to some irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. Lifting and moving those boxes at the festival could have caused some muscle strain or irritation in that area, leading to the hiccups. It's also possible it's a benign esophageal spasm, though less likely given the lack of significant discomfort. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or a mediastinal mass. And a basic blood panel to check your electrolyte levels, as imbalances can sometimes cause hiccups. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. An X-ray and blood panel seem reasonable. I'd rather be safe than sorry. I just want these hiccups to stop. Is the blood panel a lot of blood? I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a lot of blood. Just a standard tube or two. The nurse is very good, and we can get you comfortable. We'll draw it from your arm. Okay, I’ll order those tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to get some information and draw your blood. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend trying some over-the-counter medications for hiccups. Things like simethicone or even a teaspoon of sugar might help. Also, try drinking water slowly and breathing deeply. If the hiccups continue for more than a week, or if they get worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – like fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please call the clinic immediately or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Simethicone, sugar, slow water, deep breaths. I can try all of those. I think I understand everything you’ve said. Actually… yes, one question. Will the X-ray… you know, expose me to a lot of radiation? I’ve heard things about that.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low – it’s a small dose, comparable to the natural background radiation you're exposed to over a few days. The benefits of ruling out more serious conditions far outweigh the minimal risk from the X-ray. We use the lowest possible dose necessary to get a clear image. The radiologist will also follow all safety protocols. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I'll try those remedies and get the tests done. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismissing it as just "hiccups." Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms change. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
