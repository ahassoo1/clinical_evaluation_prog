DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin' to you too, Doctor. Truth be told, I've been feelin' a bit…off. My blood pressure's been runnin' high, the nurse told me when she checked it. That's what my regular doctor said to get checked out, anyways. He's a good man, but he moved away. Just want to make sure I don't need to worry too much, you know? Old age creeps up on ya.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's prudent to investigate changes in blood pressure, certainly. And it’s good you’re being proactive. “A bit off” is rather vague, however. Could you elaborate on what that feels like, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Hmm… vague is a good word for it. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… tired, all the time. And sometimes my head feels kinda… full. Like there’s cotton in it. And I get dizzy standin’ up too fast. Mostly just tired though. Been bakin’ less 'cause of it, and that ain’t like me.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, a sensation of fullness in the head, and dizziness upon standing. These could be related to hypertension, but there are, naturally, other possibilities. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I reckon. It didn’t just happen overnight. Started maybe… six months ago? At first, I just thought I was gettin' older. You know, achin' joints and all that. But it’s been gettin’ worse, that tiredness. It used to be just at the end of the day, now it's pretty much all day long.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive fatigue. Alright. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I can rightly say. I haven’t changed nothin’ in my diet, not really. Still bakin’ – when I have the energy, that is. And I ain’t been under any extra stress, bless my heart. Just… livin’. Maybe the weather? It's been awful hot this summer, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just my arthritis, like I said. And my eyesight ain’t what it used to be, that’s why I got these glasses. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s been fine for ages. Other than that… nothin’ major, doctor. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, diminished vision, and a cholecystectomy… years ago. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. They gave me somethin' for a cold when I was a little girl, and I don’t remember havin’ a reaction. Never been one for takin’ pills if I can avoid it, so I haven’t had much experience with 'em.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, when it flares up real bad. It's called… well, I forget the name now. It comes in a little orange bottle. The pharmacist knows what I mean. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little bit of chamomile tea. That’s it, doctor. Honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to ascertain the specific name of that arthritis medication. It's important to know what you are taking. Now, Ms. Steines, do you have any family history of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That's a hard one. My mama, she had… somethin' with her heart, I think. She passed when I was young, so I don't remember much. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, but he didn't take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, poor man. My daddy was healthy as an ox, though, lived to be eighty-somethin'. So… mixed, I guess.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of heart issues, paternal history of good health. And finally, Ms. Steines, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, doctor? I live alone since my husband passed. Been widower for… oh, Lord, fifteen years now. I keep busy bakin', mostly. And I see my grandkids when they come to visit.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I meant… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, doctor, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life, and I haven't had a drink since my weddin' day. And recreational drugs? Land sakes, I'm ninety years old! What would I need with them?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Steines, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and perhaps look in your ears and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? These old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. I detect a mild murmur, which is not uncommon at your age. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though your breathing is somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is elevated… 162 over 94. Pulse is 88. External auditory canals appear clear. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but your reflexes are diminished. Overall, your physical findings are consistent with your age and reported symptoms. However, the elevated blood pressure requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound too good, does it? What does 'further investigation' mean, doctor? Am I gonna need more tests? I don't do well with tests.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Steines, it likely means some blood work and possibly an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. These tests will help us determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and rule out any underlying conditions. They are relatively simple and non-invasive. We also need to assess your kidney function. It is important to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More things. Well, I suppose I don't have much choice, do I? If it'll help, then yes, doctor, you go ahead. Just… try to be quick, alright? And tell me what everything means afterward. I don't want to be left wonderin'.
DOCTOR: Very good. I will order the necessary blood work and schedule you for an EKG. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we’ll get the EKG scheduled for later this week. Once we have the results, we will review them together and discuss the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you reduce your salt intake and engage in light exercise if you are able. The lab results should be available within 48 hours. We will call you with the findings. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers it. Just… thank you, doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen. I was gettin' worried somethin' awful. I think I'll just be glad when I know what's goin' on. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you shortly. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Stop.
