DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Reflux, the nurse said. It’s just… unpleasant. And it’s been happening more lately. Frankly, I don't understand why I even need to explain this to a doctor. Isn't that what you're for?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Altine. You’re right, I’m here to help. And I appreciate you being direct. “This stuff coming up,” as you put it… can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it happens mostly after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Though, maybe after something… richer. Doesn’t change anything, though. It just… comes up. Like, a burning feeling, and then… well, you get the picture. And it leaves a bad taste. Really bad. It's… disruptive. I have things to do, you know. I’m an Emergency Management Director. Can’t be running around with… that happening. Does that make sense? I don’t usually complain about things, but this is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it's a burning sensation that comes up after eating, regardless of what you’ve eaten, and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. And it’s been happening more frequently, causing you some disruption. Is that a good summary?
PATIENT: Good enough. Look, are we going to figure this out, or are we just going to rehash what I’ve already told you? I have a meeting in… well, never mind. Just tell me what's wrong and what I need to do to fix it. Quickly. And no fancy medical terms, please. I don't have time for a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand your time is valuable. It sounds like you're describing symptoms consistent with acid reflux, or heartburn, as many people call it. It happens when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus. We’ll need to rule out anything more serious, but that's the most likely explanation at this point. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, no. That’s it. It burns, it comes up, it tastes awful. I’m not a complainer. I’ve dealt with worse. I lead emergency response teams, for goodness sake. A little heartburn isn’t going to stop me. Is this going to take long? Do I need any tests? Because I really don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding. I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other symptoms, and you’re quite right, heartburn shouldn’t stop anyone, especially someone in your profession. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, any pain in your chest – other than the burning sensation – or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no, and absolutely not. Look, I eat. I maintain my weight. And I don’t have chest pain. I’m not… frail. I’m perfectly healthy, aside from this… little inconvenience. Is there a pill for this? Can we just skip to the solution? I really don't understand why you need to ask so many questions. It's acid coming up. Isn't that enough? I swear, the paperwork alone for this visit is going to take longer than most emergencies I handle.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question the questions, Mr. Altine. We need to rule out other possibilities, even if it seems straightforward. Sometimes what feels like simple heartburn can be something else. Given your symptoms and your insistence that it’s likely just heartburn, we can start with a trial of medication. An over-the-counter proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, can often help reduce stomach acid production. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, yes, of course. Just give me the pill. Anything to get this over with. What's it called? And how long do I need to take it? I assume I don't need to come back for a follow-up? I really, really don't have time for another appointment. Look, I have a city to protect. A little acid reflux isn’t going to keep me from doing my job, but all this… fuss… might.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing you Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, for two weeks. It’s generally very effective. If you don’t see significant improvement within a week or two, then we’ll need to discuss further testing and possibly a referral to a gastroenterologist. I do recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks, just to ensure it’s working and that there are no unexpected side effects. However, if you are unable to come in, we can discuss a phone consultation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A phone call is… acceptable. But I'm telling you, it's just acid. I've handled worse. Much worse. Just give me the prescription and let me get going. Honestly, the amount of time I’ve wasted here… it’s appalling. You young doctors… always overthinking things. I’m a practical man. I deal with reality. And the reality is, I need to be getting back to work. Where is this… prescription?
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Altine. The prescription is for Omeprazole, as we discussed. The instructions are on the label. I’m glad we could get this addressed. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I understand your time is valuable, and I appreciate your patience. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… a waste of time. A complete waste. Thank you. .
