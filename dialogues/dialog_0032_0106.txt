DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pipkorn, you say? Well. It’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A very nasty sore. Been going on for weeks now, and frankly, I'm not impressed with how long it's taken to heal. I expect results, you understand. I don’t have all day to sit around with a bad foot.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! Since…let me think…around the middle of June, I’d say. Right after my grandson visited. He tracked a lot of dirt in here, that boy. Probably brought something in with him. Though, I keep a spotless home, usually. It’s just…this thing won’t go away. It's on the bottom of my right foot, near my heel. And it hurts. It throbs, especially if I try to walk too much. I used to walk every morning, you know. For my health. Now…it's just painful. Do you understand? Painful!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A sore on the bottom of your right foot, near the heel, starting around mid-June. And it’s been painful enough to disrupt your usual walking routine. Could you describe the sore itself?
PATIENT: Well, it's…open. Red around the edges, naturally. And it's…deep. Not just a little scrape, you understand. I've tried putting ointment on it, that stuff my neighbor gave me, but it doesn't seem to do much. It's also…smelly. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. And it sometimes…weeps. Just a little, but it gets on my socks. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve always taken good care of myself, you know. This is…unexpected. And frankly, a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned ointment. What kind of ointment was it, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…It was a jar…blue label, I believe. Something about…healing. My neighbor, Elsie, she swears by it. Said it cured her cousin’s shingles. It wasn’t one of those fancy prescription things, mind you. Just something she got at the drugstore. I can’t recall the exact name, though. Elsie's the one who knows about those things, not me. I just tried it because I was desperate. It didn’t seem to make much difference, honestly. A waste of good money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to take a closer look. If you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a physical examination of your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. And don't take too long. I have an appointment with my hairdresser later this afternoon. It's very important. I won’t have all day to sit here. And try not to make a mess. Honestly, some doctors are so clumsy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I assure you I will be as efficient and careful as possible. If you could please sit here, I will begin the examination. I see…there’s a significant ulceration present on the plantar aspect of your right heel. It’s approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, with irregular borders and some surrounding erythema. There is some purulent drainage present, and the area is tender to the touch. No warmth noted. Peripheral pulses are present, though somewhat diminished. I’m also noting some callus formation around the ulcer. Based on my examination, this appears to be a complicated foot ulcer. It’s important to determine the underlying cause. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, my doctor mentioned something years ago, when I was pregnant with my son. Something about my sugar being a little high. But he said it wasn’t anything to worry about. I’ve always been very careful with my diet. Not too many sweets, you understand. I suppose it could have been diabetes, but I've never really paid much attention to it. It was so long ago. And I've always been perfectly healthy…until this foot, that is. Honestly, I’m more concerned about getting this cleared up so I can walk again. It’s very important for my health.
DOCTOR: Right. It’s important to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of diabetes, as it can significantly affect wound healing. We will need to perform a blood glucose test. I would also like to order some labs to assess your overall health and rule out any infection. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I don’t take anything. Never have, never will. I believe in natural remedies, you understand. Elsie makes a wonderful tea for aches and pains. That’s all I need. No, no allergies. I’m perfectly healthy, aside from this foot, of course. And frankly, I’d prefer to avoid any unnecessary…chemicals. I’m not sure I trust all those fancy pills doctors like to prescribe these days. Are you absolutely certain these tests are necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, while I understand your preference for natural remedies, these tests are medically necessary to determine the underlying cause of your ulcer and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Ignoring a potential underlying medical condition could lead to further complications. We need to rule out infection and assess your overall health. It’s not about prescribing unnecessary pills; it's about providing you with the best possible care. Would you be willing to allow me to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a wound culture?
PATIENT: Hmph. Wound culture…that sounds…unpleasant. And a complete blood count? All that poking and prodding? Very well. But be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. Honestly, I don’t understand why everything has to be so complicated. In my day, doctors had a much simpler approach. A little ointment, a bandage, and a good night's rest. That's all anyone ever needed. But fine. Do your tests. Just…promise me you won’t subject me to anything too…invasive. And tell me when I can expect results. I have an appointment on Friday, and I need to know if I'll be able to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the labs now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. The wound culture will be taken here in the examination room. The results should be available within 48-72 hours. I will have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent further infection and a special dressing to protect the wound. I'll also recommend offloading pressure from the ulcer as much as possible. We can discuss appropriate footwear options later. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Footwear? Honestly. I have perfectly good shoes. I’ve always taken good care of my things. But…offloading pressure…what does that even mean? And what about this ointment? Is it safe? I don’t want any side effects. I've heard terrible stories about those pharmaceutical companies. And will it stain my socks? I have a lovely pair of new ones…silk, you understand. Very delicate. Honestly, I just want this foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And...how long will that take?
DOCTOR: Offloading pressure means reducing the amount of weight and friction on your foot, Ms. Cannington. This allows the ulcer to heal without further irritation. This can be achieved with special shoes, padding, or bracing. The topical antibiotic ointment is generally safe, with minimal side effects. Occasionally, some people may experience mild skin irritation. It should not stain your silk socks, but I would recommend wearing thicker socks over the ointment to prevent any potential discoloration. As for how long it will take to heal, that depends on several factors, including the severity of the ulcer, your overall health, and your adherence to treatment. With proper care, we can expect to see improvement within a few weeks, but complete healing may take several months. Do you have any further questions about the ointment, offloading, or the healing process?
PATIENT: Months? Months? Honestly, that’s unacceptable. I have a cruise planned for December. I simply cannot spend months hobbling around with a sore foot. December is too important. And…what if this doesn’t work? What if this ointment doesn't do anything? Will I need surgery? I’ve heard terrible things about foot surgery. And what about this cruise? Will I be able to go? I need to know. I simply must know. This is very upsetting. Honestly, you’re not giving me much reassurance. Elsie always knows what to do. Perhaps I should consult with her.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns. It’s natural to be anxious about a prolonged healing process and the impact on your upcoming cruise. While complete healing may take several months, we will closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. We will start with conservative measures – the ointment, offloading, and wound care – and assess your response. Surgery is rarely necessary in cases like yours, but it is an option we can discuss if conservative treatment fails. I assure you, my goal is to get you back on your feet as quickly and safely as possible. While I respect your relationship with Elsie, I am a medical professional with years of training and experience. I believe I am best equipped to provide you with the most appropriate care. To reiterate, we will start with conservative treatment, monitor your progress closely, and adjust the plan as needed. Let’s focus on that for now. Do you have any questions about the specific instructions for wound care and offloading?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Instructions. I suppose. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about any of this. What exactly do I have to do? Be specific. I don’t want to mess this up. And what if I forget something? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. Elsie is very good at reminding people. Honestly, this is all so complicated. But…fine. Tell me what I need to do. And try to keep it simple. I want to be able to go on my cruise. That’s the most important thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a handout with detailed instructions, but I will go over the key points with you. First, wash your hands thoroughly before and after touching your wound. Gently clean the wound with mild soap and water, pat it dry with a clean towel, and apply a thin layer of the antibiotic ointment. Then, cover the wound with a special dressing – the one I’ve prescribed. It is crucial to change the dressing daily, or more frequently if it becomes wet or soiled. Avoid putting direct pressure on your foot as much as possible. Wear comfortable, supportive shoes with a wide toe box. And it is essential to keep your foot dry and clean. If you forget anything, please do not hesitate to call the nurse. They are available to answer any questions and provide assistance. And if you notice any signs of infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus – contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Pus? You said pus? Honestly, that sounds dreadful. I don’t want pus. And comfortable shoes? My shoes are comfortable. They’re Italian leather. Very expensive. I don’t want to wear anything else. And call the nurse? Honestly, I don’t like bothering people. Elsie always says it’s better to just handle things yourself. But…fine. I suppose I can try to remember all of this. But if I get pus, I’m blaming you. And my cruise…you promise I’ll be able to go on my cruise? It’s in December, you understand. Very important. I’ve already bought a new outfit. Silk, naturally.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns. While the possibility of pus exists, it is not a certainty. Following these instructions diligently will minimize that risk. And while I cannot guarantee that you will be able to go on your cruise, following the treatment plan closely will significantly increase your chances of a full recovery and allow you to enjoy your trip. We will monitor your progress closely and adjust the plan as needed. For now, let's focus on following these instructions and keeping your wound clean and dry. We will re-evaluate your progress in two weeks. If you experience any concerning symptoms – increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus – or if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough for now. Honestly, this has been very…stressful. Just…try not to make me come back too often. And promise me you’ll do everything you can to get me on that cruise. It's very important. Very well. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. Have a good day, Ms. Cannington. And please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns.
