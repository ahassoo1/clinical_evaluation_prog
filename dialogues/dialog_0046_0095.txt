DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It's August 2nd. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I shouldn't have to be here. But my housekeeper insisted. Sudden deafness in one ear, and my face feels…droopy. It started yesterday, and it’s incredibly inconvenient. I have a very important conference call later. Can we just figure out what needs to be done to fix it, quickly?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concern and the inconvenience this is causing, especially with your conference call. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely things we need to investigate promptly. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me more about when exactly the hearing loss started?
PATIENT: Yesterday morning. I woke up and it was just…gone. In my left ear. No pain, no ringing, just…nothing. And then, later in the day, I noticed my mouth felt a little strange when I was brushing my teeth. It’s hard to describe. Like half my face isn't working quite right. Honestly, I don't have time for a detailed recounting of every moment. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good start, thank you. And you haven’t experienced any dizziness, headache, or vision changes along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: No. Do I look like I’ve had a stroke? I’m a radiologist, Doctor. I know what a stroke looks like. Just the ear and the face. It's… unsettling, naturally. But I assure you, I haven't been collapsing or seeing double. I'd know if I had.
DOCTOR: Of course, you would. It's good you're so observant. And just to confirm, you haven’t had any recent illnesses – like a cold, the flu, or any other infection – in the weeks leading up to this?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Doctor, I haven't been sick in years. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Proper diet, regular exercise, and I avoid people who are unwell. It's common sense. No, I have not had a cold, the flu, or anything of the sort. This came on suddenly, out of nowhere. A perfectly healthy ear, and then... nothing. Frankly, it's quite alarming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, it’s important to rule out several possibilities. Before we proceed, could you please tell me about any allergies you have to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? Must we go through everything? Fine. Penicillin gives me a rash. That’s it. A mild rash. It’s not life-threatening. And honestly, I'd rather not take anything unless it’s absolutely necessary. I'm very careful about what I put into my body. Are we getting any closer to a diagnosis, or are we just compiling a list of irrelevant information?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the penicillin allergy. And you’re right to want to get to the bottom of this quickly. I want to assure you I’m gathering this information to ensure I can provide you with the best and safest care. Now, let's talk about current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements currently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I barely take a vitamin. I eat a balanced diet, as I said. No prescriptions. Absolutely nothing. I pride myself on my health. It's a simple life, really. A little exercise, good food, and avoiding unnecessary…interventions. This is all a waste of time, if you ask me. A perfectly good radiologist, stuck here answering endless questions. Just tell me what’s wrong, and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, I’m trying to be thorough. Okay. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, and the absence of other symptoms, we need to consider a few possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. That will involve checking your ears, nose, throat, and a neurological exam to assess your facial nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I'm a perfectly capable professional. I know my own body. But... fine. Get it over with. But be quick about it. I have a very important conference call, and I refuse to be late. Just… don't poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your ears. I’m going to look inside both ears with this instrument. Alright, the ear canals themselves appear clear, but I do note some mild erythema – redness – of the tympanic membrane in your left ear. No obvious signs of fluid or infection. Your nasal passages are clear, and your throat appears normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a few simple things. Could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: Done. Now can we please hurry this along? My time is valuable, Doctor. I’m a radiologist, you know. I interpret scans, I don't spend my days having my face poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, can you try to wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: Is that enough? Honestly, it’s never been my strongest feature. I’m far more skilled at reading images than making faces, Doctor. This is a ridiculous waste of time. I can feel the difference, you know. One side isn't working properly. Do you need to see me try to smile like a fool next?
DOCTOR: Thank you. And you are correct; I do see some asymmetry. Okay, and now, open your mouth wide and say "AH." Good. Now, stick your tongue out as far as you can. Okay, thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings – the sudden onset of hearing loss in your left ear, the facial weakness, the redness of the tympanic membrane, and the asymmetry on the neurological exam – the most likely diagnosis is Bell's palsy. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or a tumor, I recommend an MRI of the brain. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Bell's…palsy? What even is that? And an MRI? Oh, for heaven’s sake. More tests? Is this ever going to end? And honestly, Doctor, are you sure it isn't a stroke? Because I've read about strokes, and I’m not experiencing any of those symptoms. But… fine. If it’s the only way to be certain, I suppose I can agree to this…MRI. But I expect a quick turnaround. I have a conference call, remember? And someone needs to explain this “Bell’s palsy” in terms a reasonably intelligent person can understand. No medical jargon, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concern and will explain everything clearly. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It’s thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls these muscles. It doesn't usually have a known cause, but it’s often linked to a viral infection. It’s not a stroke, which is why I'm doing the MRI - to definitively rule out other causes and ensure there isn’t something more serious going on. The MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain and facial nerve. I’ll get the order sent to the radiology department right away. They should be able to schedule you for today, if possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of oral corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery. I’ll also recommend artificial tears and eye ointment to protect your left eye, as it won’t be able to blink properly. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids… great. More medication. What are the side effects? And artificial tears… honestly. This is all so inconvenient. And how long will this… Bell’s palsy… last? Will I be able to attend my conference call? That’s the real question. I cannot miss that meeting. It's incredibly important. And what’s the prognosis? Will my face be permanently droopy? Be blunt, Doctor. I don’t need sugar-coating. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns. Corticosteroids, like prednisone, can have some side effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping, and mood changes. They can also slightly increase your blood sugar, but these effects are usually temporary and resolve once you stop taking the medication. We’ll monitor your blood sugar just to be safe. Regarding the duration of Bell’s palsy, most people recover fully within a few weeks to a few months. The majority – around 70-80% – make a complete recovery. However, in some cases, there may be some residual weakness or facial asymmetry. As for your conference call, it’s difficult to say for certain whether you’ll be able to attend comfortably. The facial weakness can affect your ability to speak clearly and blink, which might be distracting. It will depend on the severity of your symptoms. As for the prognosis, the sooner we start treatment, the better your chances of a full recovery. The MRI will help us rule out other causes and determine the best course of action. We can discuss options like physical therapy if you have any residual weakness. Here's the prescription for the corticosteroids and a note recommending artificial tears. I’ll have the radiology department contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe headache, fever, or vision changes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just…get this MRI done as quickly as possible. And let’s hope this doesn’t interfere with my conference call. Honestly, this whole ordeal is incredibly frustrating. I have important things to do. I suppose that's all. I expect a prompt follow-up. Don't waste my time, Doctor. .
