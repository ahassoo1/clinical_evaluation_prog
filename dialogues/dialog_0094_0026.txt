DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, dear. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… utterly drained. Like someone’s pulled the plug. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about muscles? Honestly, I don’t pay attention to all that. It’s just… not like me to be so weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Tiredness and weakness… and the lab results mentioning something about your muscles. We'll definitely get to the bottom of that. First, let’s talk a little more about this tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? It’s all a bit of a blur, isn’t it? Probably… a few months now? Maybe longer. It comes and goes. Some days I can manage, and other days… well, other days I just have to sit. My husband, Tenzin, he does most of the work around the house now. Not that I can’t… it’s just easier, you know? I used to be so active, though. Commercial diving, it keeps you busy!
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, wow! That is active. And it sounds like this tiredness has been gradually worsening over several months, with some good days and some bad. You mentioned it makes it difficult to do things around the house. Are you experiencing any difficulty with specific activities, like climbing stairs, lifting objects, or getting up from a chair?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. Getting up is the worst! It’s like… like trying to pull myself out of mud. And stairs? Forget about it. Tenzin practically has to haul me up sometimes. Lifting things… well, I don’t bother anymore. I used to be able to carry all sorts of equipment, you know, for the diving. Now? A grocery bag feels like a boulder. It's embarrassing, really. I shouldn't be needing help at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand how frustrating that must be, Ardelle. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. We'll figure out what’s going on. Besides the weakness and tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Well, my muscles… sometimes they ache, you know? Not all the time, but especially after I’ve been trying to do something. And I've been falling a bit more, just clumsy things. Tripped over the rug the other day. Nothing serious, but… it’s not like me. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit… foggy-headed, I suppose. Not sharp like I used to be. Tenzin says I repeat myself sometimes, but he always says that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so muscle aches, some clumsiness and falls, and some cognitive difficulties – feeling a bit “foggy-headed” and repeating yourself. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long time ago, can’t even remember the exact year. And I had a bit of a bad knee from the diving, but that’s been mostly managed with… well, with ignoring it mostly. Tenzin keeps telling me to see someone about it, but I don’t like doctors, you know? As for other things… I’m sure there’s been something… but it’s all a bit of a blur. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to remember everything. Having your gallbladder removed and a history of knee problems are good to know. And you've mentioned memory issues, which we've touched on already. Has anyone ever discussed the possibility of dementia or other cognitive problems with you?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Tenzin… he grumbles sometimes, says I ask the same questions over and over, but he just puts it down to old age. I think he thinks I'm just being difficult. No doctor has ever said anything about my memory. I’m still perfectly capable, you know. I just… forget things sometimes. Everyone does, don’t they?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, everyone forgets things sometimes. It’s good to know no one has formally discussed cognitive issues with you. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… my family. Well, my mother, she lived to a very old age, but she had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains in her later years. Arthritis, I think. And my father, he was a strong man, but he had heart trouble towards the end. And my brother… he had some sort of trouble with his legs, couldn’t walk very well when he got older. But beyond that… I can’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis, heart trouble, and leg problems. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked a day in my life! Horrible habit. And alcohol? Just a tiny sip of wine with special meals, very rarely. I always thought it was a waste of good food money. Tenzin likes a little beer sometimes, but nothing excessive. We both try to stay healthy, you know. Well, as healthy as an old woman can be.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... Allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but I’ve been taking it for years, and it’s never bothered me. Tenzin always makes sure I take it. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Just… getting old, that’s all it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Ardelle. No known allergies and you take medication for blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and get a better sense of what's going on. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh... well... I suppose so. I don’t much like being poked and prodded, but if you think it’s necessary… alright. Just be gentle, dear. My bones are a bit brittle these days. And please don’t take too long. I have to get back to help Tenzin with dinner.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be very gentle. We’ll take it slow. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. I’m going to check your reflexes now. A little diminished, but not alarming. Now, let's test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, all right. There. Is that enough? It's not as strong as it used to be, I'll admit. I used to be able to crush walnuts with these hands! Back when I was diving, I needed a good grip. Everything feels a bit weak, you know? Even just holding a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. And I notice a bit of tremor in your hands as well, though it’s very mild. Now, I’d like to check your gait – how you walk. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Walking? I suppose so. There. Not very graceful, am I? Tenzin says I walk like an old turtle. I have to be careful not to trip. It's a bit wobbly, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. That was very helpful. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few things we need to investigate further. Your symptoms – the tiredness, weakness, muscle aches, clumsiness, and cognitive difficulties – along with the exam findings suggest we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and something called creatinine kinase, which can be elevated with muscle damage. We'll also do a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection. And I think it would be a good idea to get an MRI of your brain, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. More tests? It’s always something with doctors, isn’t it? MRI… that sounds… complicated. I don’t like being stuck in machines. And all that talk of “creatinine kinase”… it just goes over my head. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I’ll do it. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. I don't like feeling like this, all weak and foggy-headed. Tenzin will want to know all the details, though. He always worries so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ardelle. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about tests. The MRI is painless, and you won’t be stuck; you’ll be lying comfortably on a table. It just takes a little while, and we’ll be right there with you the whole time. The blood tests are quick and easy, just a small sample of blood. We'll get the results back as soon as possible, and I'll explain everything to you in detail. And of course, I'll be happy to discuss the results with Tenzin as well. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a daily multivitamin, just to make sure you're getting all the essential nutrients. And it's important to stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A multivitamin, that sounds sensible. And water… I can manage that. Um… yes, I do have a question. Will these tests… will they show if my brain is… fading? Tenzin sometimes hints that I’m not as sharp as I used to be, and… well, it worries me. I don’t want to become a burden.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ardelle. The MRI will help us assess the structure of your brain and rule out any potential causes for cognitive difficulties. It can detect changes that might explain some of the symptoms you're experiencing, like the fogginess and memory issues. However, it's important to remember that an MRI is just one piece of the puzzle. We'll also do a cognitive assessment – a series of simple questions and tasks – to evaluate your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. And even if we do find some changes, that doesn’t necessarily mean you're losing your mind. There are many things that can cause cognitive difficulties, and many of them are treatable. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and develop a plan to manage your symptoms and keep you as healthy and independent as possible. You are not a burden, Ardelle. You’ve lived a long and full life, and you deserve to feel your best. We're here to help you with that. Do you feel comfortable scheduling the tests today?
PATIENT: Oh... well. That's... reassuring, I suppose. It's just… all this talk of brains and fading minds is a bit frightening. Tenzin will be relieved to hear you’re doing a proper assessment. He worries so much. Alright. Yes, let’s schedule the tests. Get it over with, I say. The sooner we know, the better. But please, be gentle with the machines. And explain everything very clearly. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I'll make sure everything is explained clearly, and we’ll take it at your pace. I’ll also arrange for a nurse to call you with specific instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. I’m scheduling the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and the MRI for next week. We’ll aim for Tuesday, if that works for you. Here’s a copy of the test orders and a referral to the imaging center. And I'll also give you a list of resources for cognitive health, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Ardelle?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me. I just hope these tests don’t take too long, and that they don’t find anything too dreadful. I suppose I’ll go home now and tell Tenzin. He’ll want to know everything. And he’ll probably start fussing over me already. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good afternoon, and give Tenzin my best.
PATIENT: .
