DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My back… it hurts real bad. It’s been hurting for a little while, but now… now I can barely move. And, you know… I have the cancer. I was hoping it wasn’t this, but… it feels connected, somehow.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that's gotten significantly worse, and you're understandably concerned it might be related to your cancer. That’s very reasonable to think about. Let's definitely get to the bottom of this. First, let's talk about this back pain. When you say "a little while," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three, four weeks now? It started just a little ache, you know? I thought I just slept wrong. I work at the factory… lifting boxes… I thought it was just from that. But then it started getting worse each day. Now… now it’s like a sharp pain, all the time. Even when I sit still.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks, started as a mild ache and progressively worsened to a sharp, constant pain, even at rest. That's helpful. And you mentioned lifting boxes at the factory – what kind of lifting are we talking about?
PATIENT: Mostly… boxes of food. Canned goods, things like that. Not super heavy, maybe 20, 30 pounds each. Lots of bending and twisting to get them onto the shelves, or the conveyor belt. We have to move fast, you know? It’s a pretty quick pace.
DOCTOR: Okay, so repetitive lifting, bending, and twisting of 20-30 pound boxes at a quick pace. That certainly sounds like it could be contributing. Now, where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It’s… low down. On my back, right here. And it feels like it goes around a little, into my hips sometimes. Not always, but when it’s really bad. And sometimes I feel it down my leg, just a little bit. Not all the way to my foot, but… you know, down the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain, radiating around to the hips and sometimes down the back of your leg – that gives me a better picture. Does anything specific make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… sitting still doesn't make it much better, but lying down flat, on my back… that helps a little. But not for long. And moving… moving makes it worse. Especially bending over. Or twisting. Even just getting out of a chair is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat provides some relief, but not for long, and movement, bending, and twisting aggravate the pain. Let's talk a bit about this cancer diagnosis. What type of cancer are you being treated for, and what is your current treatment plan?
PATIENT: It’s… it's lung cancer. They found it last year. I’ve been doing chemotherapy, every few weeks. And… radiation sometimes, when it flares up. It’s been… okay, most of the time. But lately, I’ve been feeling more tired, and… just weaker. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Meigs. Chemotherapy and radiation can definitely cause fatigue and weakness, and it's important to consider that as we sort through what's going on with your back. It's good you're telling me all of this. Before we move on, are you experiencing any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything feels… normal, there. A little shaky sometimes, when I stand up, but not numb or tingly. I can still walk, I can still do things… it’s just hard and it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, tingling, or significant weakness in the legs or feet, just some shakiness upon standing. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and do some palpation to get a better idea of where the pain is coming from. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm getting worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness right here, in the lumbar region – that’s the lower part of your back. You’re also a bit tight on this side. Alright, bending forward is limited and painful. Side bends are also restricted. Your reflexes are normal, and strength is 5/5 in both legs, which is good. Based on the exam, it appears you have some muscle spasm and restricted movement in your lower back. It's consistent with a musculoskeletal strain, possibly aggravated by your work and potentially influenced by your cancer treatment. However, given your history, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the bones and rule out any fractures or other structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to make sure nothing is… serious. Is it okay if my daughter comes with me when I get it done? She worries about me a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. Having your daughter with you is perfectly fine, and I encourage it if it makes you feel more comfortable. We'll do everything we can to figure this out. I'm going to write an order for the X-ray now, and the receptionist will schedule it for you. It’s usually a quick process. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – an NSAID – to help with the pain and spasm. I'll also recommend some gentle stretching exercises and advise you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we get the X-ray results. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Stretching… I can try that. And no lifting… I’ll have to tell my boss. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's my job, and I’m glad I could help. It’s important to take care of yourself, and that includes communicating your limitations at work. Here are some gentle stretches you can start with. Listen to your body, and don't push yourself too hard. If anything causes pain, stop immediately. We’ll get those X-ray results back within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we’ll discuss the findings and create a more comprehensive plan. If your pain worsens significantly or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, numbness, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for letting my daughter come with me to the X-ray.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Take it easy, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The receptionist will help you schedule the X-ray on your way out. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
