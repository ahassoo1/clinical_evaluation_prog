DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s this unsteadiness I’ve been experiencing. It’s rather… disconcerting. I find myself feeling off-balance quite a bit, and it’s been worrying me. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been some time now.
DOCTOR: Unsteadiness, alright. And you said it's been going on for some time… hmm. It’s difficult to pinpoint when it began, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It’s… frustrating. Things haven't been very clear lately, if I’m being frank. I just know it wasn’t a sudden thing. It sort of… gradually worsened, I suppose. I wish I could be more specific, but details… they don’t stick with me as they used to. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: It’s not unusual at all, Lilyanna. Memory can be… tricky. We can work around it. So, gradually worsened… can you describe what you feel when you’re unsteady?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a spinning sensation, not dizziness exactly. It’s more like… my feet aren’t quite connected to the ground, if that makes any sense. Like I’m… floating a little. And sometimes, I stumble, just unexpectedly. It’s quite unsettling, especially at work. I operate a rotary drill, you see, and… well, stability is rather important in that line of work.
DOCTOR: Not spinning, more of a disconnected feeling... and stumbling. Rotary drill work… yes, that does sound concerning. Alright. Does anything specific trigger these episodes, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It… seems to be somewhat random, though I think it’s worse when I’m tired. Long shifts at work definitely don’t help. And… perhaps when I’m stressed? Though truthfully, it’s difficult to separate the two these days. I often feel quite… overwhelmed. I don’t know if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and stress… those can certainly play a part. It's good you're noticing those connections. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been… rather fatigued, as I mentioned. And… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I thought that was just from staring at the drill all day. Oh! And I’ve had a few headaches, mild ones, nothing debilitating. They come and go. I… am I forgetting something? It's terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, blurry vision, mild headaches… alright. Don’t worry about forgetting things, Lilyanna. We’ll get to everything. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… I believe I had a rather unpleasant cold a few months back, but nothing serious. Recovered fully, I thought. Beyond that… not that I recall. My memory is… spotty, as you’ve noticed. I really wish I could be more helpful. It feels like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… Hmm. I… lost my husband a little while ago. It was… quite a shock. Aside from the grief, I don’t recall any significant health issues. I’ve always been relatively healthy, I believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… but nothing lasting. I had a… a rather thorough physical before starting at the oil rig, and everything was deemed satisfactory then. But that was some time ago now.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't been on any medications regularly. Occasionally, I take something for a headache, but nothing prescribed. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers. I generally try to avoid them if possible. I prefer to… tough it out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I'd like to ask about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I can eat most foods without issue. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything of that nature. I'm fairly certain I have no allergies, but… I wouldn’t stake my life on it, if that makes sense. My recall isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. Just a basic neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination, check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I… trust your judgment. I just hope you can discover the cause of this unsteadiness. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just follow my instructions as best you can. First, let's try standing with your feet together and your eyes closed. Just hold that position for a moment, and I’ll observe your balance. Now, can you tell me if you feel steady?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No, I don't. It feels… precarious. Like I'm going to fall. It's… worse with my eyes closed. I feel a little dizzy, actually. Perhaps I should sit down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please, sit down. That's alright, it's good to know. Now, let’s try a simple Romberg test. Could you extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes… like this? They're… shaking a little. It's difficult to keep them steady. And I feel… off-balance even sitting down now. It's… rather disconcerting. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. This isn’t necessarily normal, but it gives us some information. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you relax your legs, and I’ll gently tap your knees with this little hammer?
PATIENT: Yes… go ahead. I… I hope this isn't too alarming. I'm not particularly fond of surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Response is… somewhat diminished bilaterally, but present. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, heart rate is regular… no murmurs detected.
PATIENT: Very well. That… doesn’t sound too dreadful, does it? I confess, I don’t understand much of what you’re saying, but if everything sounds “regular” that must be a good sign. Is there… a cause you suspect? Or is it too early to say?
DOCTOR: It's too early to definitively say, Lilyanna. The diminished reflexes and the unsteady balance are concerning, but they can have many causes. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it could be several things. It could be related to inner ear problems, a neurological issue, or even something as simple as vitamin deficiency. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and general health. I also recommend a referral to an audiologist for a hearing and balance assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… an audiologist. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything that might help determine the cause. I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. I just want to feel… stable again. When would I be able to schedule these appointments? And… will the results take long to come back?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have my assistant schedule the blood work for you this afternoon, and get a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a very good audiologist, sent over. The blood work usually takes 2-3 business days to come back. Dr. Reed's office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment once they receive the referral. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience severe dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… quite thorough. 2-3 business days for the blood work, and then an appointment with Dr. Reed. I will be sure to contact you if anything worsens. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. It’s… reassuring to know we’re taking steps to find a solution.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. My assistant will walk you to the exit and schedule the blood work for you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
