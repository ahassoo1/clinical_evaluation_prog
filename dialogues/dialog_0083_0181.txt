DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Alanes. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I requested a general wellness check – a lab panel, if you will. I just like to keep an eye on things, you understand. At my age, it’s best to be proactive. I believe the results are ready for review?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, your lab results came back yesterday. Thank you for being so proactive about your health – that’s excellent. Before we dive into those results, I'd like to get a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. It helps me get a complete picture. First, can you tell me about any major illnesses or health conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Let me see… I’ve been quite fortunate, actually. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps forty years ago, but recovered fully. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with a life of… well, physical labor. I’ve been a construction laborer for most of my life, you see. Nothing serious ever required extended treatment or hospitalization. My wife, Elena, always tells me I’m too stubborn to stay in a hospital!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Pneumonia is certainly something, but it sounds like you’ve recovered well. And it’s admirable you've been able to remain active with a physically demanding job for so long! Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, I have. A few, as time went on. When I was… oh, let me think… around fifty-two years of age, I had a rather nasty tear in my meniscus, playing football with some of the younger men on the crew. Required arthroscopic surgery to repair it. And then, about ten years ago, I had my appendix removed. It was a rather sudden affair, I recall. Nothing too complicated, thankfully. Both procedures were performed at St. Joseph’s Hospital, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Mombrun. Both of those are good to have documented. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My father, he had… well, the doctor called it hypertension, I believe. High blood pressure, it was. He managed it with medication for many years, but it eventually… contributed to his passing, I suppose. My mother, she lived a long life, thankfully. She had some arthritis in her hands, towards the end, but otherwise, quite healthy. Elena’s side of the family… her mother had diabetes, and I believe her brother has heart issues. It’s something we've discussed, of course. We try to eat well, stay active… you know, the usual precautions.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Mombrun – a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and heart issues. It's good you and Elena are proactive about lifestyle choices. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as recommended by my previous doctor – for preventative reasons, you understand. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up – which is more common with the change in weather – I’ll take ibuprofen. Just as needed, though, nothing regular. I also take a multivitamin, a basic one, and some fish oil supplements – Elena insists on the fish oil! She reads a lot about healthy living. Other than that, no… nothing else. I prefer to keep things simple, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Mombrun. It's excellent that you're taking aspirin and fish oil, and good to hear you only use ibuprofen as needed. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life – traveling with the construction work, you pick up a taste for different cuisines – and never had any issues. Elena always checks labels, of course, but I’ve never needed to worry about allergies. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Mombrun. No allergies is certainly good news. Now, let's review your lab results. Overall, they look quite good for your age. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Your blood sugar is within normal limits, which is reassuring given your family history. Your kidney and liver functions are also normal. However, your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a little higher than we'd like. Before we discuss this further, are you experiencing any difficulty with urination, such as frequency, urgency, or a weak stream?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things so clearly. I'm glad to hear the overall results are good. The PSA being a bit high… well, that is a little concerning, I suppose. As for urination… hmm. Now that you mention it, I have noticed I need to go a bit more frequently than I used to, particularly at night. And sometimes, it takes a moment to get started, if you understand what I mean. Not a painful experience, just… a bit of a hesitation. It hasn’t been disruptive, but it is something I’ve noticed over the past few months. Elena has mentioned it as well, actually. She always has a keen eye for these things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Mombrun. It’s helpful to know that you've noticed increased frequency and a slight hesitancy. These symptoms, along with the elevated PSA, could indicate a number of things, including an enlarged prostate, which is common as men age – it's called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It could also indicate other issues, which is why we need to investigate further. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, including a digital rectal exam, to assess the size and texture of your prostate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I understand it’s a necessary step. Elena always says it’s best to be thorough. I trust your judgement, of course. If you believe it’s the best course of action, then I’m agreeable. Just… please be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Mombrun. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll explain each step as I go. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll get started. I’ll need you to bend your knees and relax your muscles. Okay, Mr. Mombrun, I'm going to gently insert a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Alright. I’m feeling your prostate now… It feels slightly enlarged, and there are some subtle irregularities on the surface. It's not significantly concerning, but it warrants further investigation. Okay, you can sit up now. Based on the exam and your lab results, I recommend a prostate-specific antigen density test, or PSAD, and a urine analysis to rule out infection. Additionally, I think it would be best to get a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. They may recommend imaging, such as an ultrasound, or a biopsy, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate your explaining everything so clearly. Yes, I agree. I would like to pursue those tests – the PSAD, the urine analysis, and a referral to a urologist. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Elena will be pleased we're taking these steps. She’s always the practical one. Could you explain a little more about what a biopsy would involve, if it comes to that? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from your prostate to examine it under a microscope. It’s the most accurate way to determine if there are any cancerous cells present. There are a few different ways to perform a biopsy. The most common method is a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. This involves inserting a small needle through your rectum to take several tissue samples. It’s usually done under local anesthesia, so you’ll be awake, but you shouldn’t feel much discomfort. You may experience some mild bleeding or discomfort for a few days afterwards. There are also other methods, such as a transperineal biopsy, which is done through the skin between your scrotum and anus, and a fusion biopsy, which uses MRI imaging to guide the needle to specific areas of the prostate. The urologist will discuss the best method for you based on your individual circumstances. They’ll also explain the risks and benefits of each procedure. For now, let's focus on scheduling the PSAD test and the urine analysis. I'll write you a referral to a urologist as well. Do you have a preferred urologist, or would you like me to recommend one?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have a preference. A recommendation from you would be wonderful. Someone… experienced, of course. And perhaps… someone who explains things clearly, like you do. I appreciate that very much. As for the tests, whenever is convenient. I’m quite flexible. Elena can help with transportation if needed. Just let me know what works best with the lab schedule.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I highly recommend Dr. Ramirez at St. Joseph's Hospital. She’s very experienced and has a wonderful bedside manner – very thorough and patient. I’ll include her contact information on the referral. I'll also send the lab order for the PSAD test and urine analysis to St. Joseph’s lab. They should contact you to schedule the appointment. It’s best to schedule them as soon as possible, just to get the ball rolling. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle – eating a balanced diet, staying active, and getting enough sleep. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience and clear explanations. Knowing what to expect always eases my mind. Elena will be pleased to hear about Dr. Ramirez. Thank you again for your time and guidance. I’ll be sure to schedule those tests promptly. Have a pleasant day, Doctor. And thank you once more.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Take care, and have a wonderful day as well. .
