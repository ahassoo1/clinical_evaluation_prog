DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, it's this surgery. Seems a bit much of a fuss over a few wrinkles, but the wife—well, was the wife—insisted. Said I looked… dilapidated. Now, the surgeon wants this clearance thing. Just want to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic procedure, then. And you're here for pre-operative clearance. Right. “Dilapidated,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. And it is cosmetic. Not like I'm failing or anything. A man can want to look presentable, can't he? Don't see what all the fuss is about needing a doctor's permission to fix a few lines. Waste of my time, really.
DOCTOR: Well, even elective procedures carry some risk, Mr. Orwin. It’s standard protocol to ensure you’re healthy enough to undergo anesthesia and recover without complications. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions—heart problems, diabetes, lung disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: Conditions? Goodness, no. I’ve lived a long life, worked hard my whole time. Terrazzo work keeps a man fit, you know. Dust and heavy lifting. Never been one for sitting about. A bit of arthritis, maybe, the usual aches of getting on in years, but nothing a good rub and some liniment can't fix. No fancy diagnoses, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… oh, must be seventy years ago now. And broke my arm falling off the roof when I was fixing the gutters. They set it, put a cast on, all done. Nothing since then. Definitely nothing serious. Are we nearly done here? I've got errands to run.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take a little something for the blood pressure, nothing fancy. And sometimes an aspirin if I’ve got a headache. Never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple man. Don't go sticking me with needles unless you absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication specifically do you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Now, see, that's where things get fuzzy. It's one of those little white pills. Been taking it for years. The doctor—can't remember his name, moved away—just kept refilling the prescription. I'm not one for remembering names or pills, I tell you that much. Does it matter what kind of pill it is?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, it absolutely matters. Different blood pressure medications can interact with anesthesia. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Here. It's probably ancient. Don’t expect miracles. My daughter keeps telling me I need to organize things, but what's the point? It just gets lost again.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20mg, once daily. Okay. And, family history. Any heart disease, stroke, or sudden death in your family?
PATIENT: Sudden death... well, old man Hemmingsen keeled over at the church social a few years back. Heart, I think. And my grandfather on my mother’s side… he wasn't a strong man, always sickly. But beyond that, no. Mostly just long lives, hard work. And stubbornness, mind you. Plenty of stubbornness. Is this getting us somewhere? Because I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history – do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. My father smoked a pipe, and it wasn't a pretty sight. Terrible cough. And alcohol… a beer with supper now and then, maybe a glass of aquavit at Christmas. I'm a sensible man, Dr. Versace. Never been one for excess. Certainly not a drinker. Does that satisfy you?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing extensive. Please sit here on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t poke and prod too much. I’m an old man, not a young sapling. And hurry it up, will you? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular. A bit of a murmur. Abdomen is soft. No tenderness. Blood pressure is 145/85, pulse is 78 and irregular. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated. And that irregular pulse is concerning, given the planned procedure. I want to order an EKG and a basic metabolic panel. And I think a cardiology consult is also warranted before we proceed with this surgery.
PATIENT: A cardiology what? Look, I’ve lived eighty-one years without a cardiologist. I’m perfectly fine. This is ridiculous. A bit of a murmur, you say? Everybody’s got something. This is just the surgeon trying to drum up business, I tell you what. No. I’m not running myself through a battery of tests for a few wrinkles. No, sir. I want a note saying I'm cleared, and I want it now. This is a waste of my time and money.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, I cannot ethically clear you for elective surgery when I've detected a cardiac irregularity and elevated blood pressure. It would be irresponsible—and potentially dangerous—to proceed without further evaluation. I understand your frustration, but my priority is your safety. I strongly advise against proceeding until we have a clearer picture of your cardiac health. I will not provide a clearance note in this situation. We can discuss alternative, non-surgical options, if you’d like. But I cannot compromise on this. I suggest you discuss this with the surgeon and potentially seek a second opinion. .
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! You're a cautious one, aren't you? Always looking for trouble where there isn't any. I'm going to get a second opinion, alright? And I'm going to tell them what a ridiculous fuss you're making. This is… outrageous! Don't expect me back. A cardiac irregularity… humph.
