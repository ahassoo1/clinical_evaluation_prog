DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… kind of embarrassing, to be honest. It’s about my body odor. It’s changed, and not in a good way. I always smelled… normal, you know? Pleasant enough. But lately, it’s… different. Kind of stronger, and not a nice smell. It started maybe a month or so ago, I think. I'm not sure exactly when.
DOCTOR: Changed how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to explain. It’s not just… sweatier. It's different sweat, if that makes sense. It’s… muskier? Kind of like… old gym socks, maybe? Not that I have old gym socks, but that’s the closest I can think of. And it doesn't go away easily, even after a shower. I usually shower twice a day now, just to try and get rid of it.
DOCTOR: Right. Twice a day. And this smell… is it all over, or localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly my armpits, but I think I can smell it a little… all over, honestly. It's faint everywhere else, but definitely noticeable under my arms. And it seems to be getting worse, even with the extra showers. It’s just… worrying me. I haven’t changed anything – no new soaps, no new deodorant, nothing different in my diet.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No weight loss or gain, definitely not. No fever, no night sweats besides what I'm talking about, no new rashes. I feel pretty normal, energy-wise. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was the summer heat. And... I've been a little more thirsty than usual, come to think of it. But that could just be from being outside, you know? I do a lot of gardening.
DOCTOR: Gardening. Alright. And you said this started about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly a month ago. It was… maybe around the end of June, beginning of July. I started noticing it after a really hot spell we had. It was gradual, at first. I thought maybe it was just the heat making me sweat more, but it didn’t go away when it cooled down a bit. That’s when I realized something was actually wrong. It's just… unsettling. I've never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but that was years ago. They put me on some medication, but I was able to get it under control with diet and exercise, so I don't take anything for that anymore. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that didn’t cause any problems afterward. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Ramirez, but this smell thing… she hasn’t seen it yet. That’s why I’m here with you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… my mother had diabetes, type 2. And my father had heart problems, so there's a family history of that too. Nothing else really stands out, as far as I know. My siblings are healthy, as far as I'm aware. We don't really talk about medical stuff much, to be honest. It's just... not something my family does. But I know my mother was diabetic, and my father had a heart attack. Other than that… nothing major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can take any kind of pain reliever, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. No food allergies, no environmental allergies… nothing. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, actually. I used to worry about allergies, but I've never had any problems. I don’t even get hay fever!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I just hope you can figure out what’s going on. It’s really starting to bother me, and it’s making me a little self-conscious, to be honest. I don’t like feeling… smelly.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged bilaterally, but not dramatically so. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, temperature is 98.6. All vital signs are within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Everything’s normal? I appreciate you checking, though. It’s good to know there’s nothing obviously wrong. The enlarged lymph nodes… is that something to worry about? I always worry about those.
DOCTOR: Slightly enlarged lymph nodes can be a sign of infection, or sometimes, more serious issues. However, given your other symptoms – the change in body odor, and the mild fatigue – I'm going to order some blood work. We need to check your thyroid levels, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule things out. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. That sounds reasonable. Thyroid levels, you say? I haven’t ever had those checked before. Is that what could be causing this? I mean, the smell? And the tiredness? And… everything? I’m just trying to understand what we’re looking for. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I’m also a little worried. Where will I go to get the blood work done? And do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid – can sometimes cause changes in body odor, fatigue, and other symptoms. It’s one possibility. The blood work will help us determine if that’s the case. You’ll go to the lab just down the hall – I’ll give you a requisition form. You do need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks, except water. Please schedule the appointment as soon as possible, and we’ll review the results when they come back. In the meantime, try not to worry. It's likely a minor issue. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay, 12 hours fasting, and go to the lab down the hall. I can do that. A requisition form… got it. And it's likely minor… that's good to hear. Okay. No, I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I'll go schedule the appointment right away. Hopefully we'll have some answers soon. I’m just… relieved to be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab results faxed to my office. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. Please call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Try to relax. It’s probably nothing serious. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I will. You too. Bye. .
