DOCTOR: Right, Nixon Kreckel… 18 years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It's been a bit bad lately. And the nurse mentioned something about… my heart beating funny? I was told it's called atrial… something? I don’t rightly understand all of it.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, likely. We'll get to that. Okay, so the leg swelling… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe a month ago? Not too bad at first, just a little puffiness after I stood for a long time. But this past week, it’s gotten bigger. And it feels… tight, almost. It doesn’t hurt, not really, just uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: A month, gradually worsening, worse with standing. Tightness, no pain… and is it just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. My right leg seems perfectly fine. I noticed it especially after a day of teaching, I'm a computer science teacher, you see. Lots of standing at the board, explaining things. It’s a new job, quite exciting, but perhaps a bit too much on my feet.
DOCTOR: Computer science teacher, okay. New job… alright. And when you’re not standing, does the swelling go down at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it does! When I sit with it raised up… like now, actually… it goes down a fair bit. Not all the way back to normal, mind you, but much better. It's only when I'm on my feet for a while that it gets really bad again.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And you mentioned your heart beating funny… have you felt it beating differently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. It feels like… sometimes it’s racing, very fast. Other times, it feels like it's skipping a beat, or fluttering. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds, but it’s unsettling. And it's been happening more often lately, especially when I'm stressed. It’s not painful, but… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest pain with any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No chest pain at all. I did feel a little dizzy once or twice, but that might have been just from standing up too quickly, I’m not sure. And no, I haven’t been short of breath. Just the racing and fluttering heart and the swollen leg. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It warrants investigation, certainly. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your leg, and take your blood pressure. Then we can decide what next steps to take. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I just want to know what’s going on, and how to make it better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, please. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are a little… irregular, as you mentioned. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your left leg. There's definitely some edema, swelling, present in your lower leg and ankle. No redness or warmth to the touch. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is irregular, around 90.
PATIENT: Right… that all sounds very… official, Doctor. Irregular, you say? Is that… serious? I didn’t know my blood pressure had numbers like that, either. I feel quite alright, most of the time. Just tired, maybe, from the new job. Is the swelling and the heart… connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Irregular pulse can be concerning, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s anything drastic. The swelling in your leg and the irregular heartbeat… they could be connected. One possibility is something called atrial fibrillation – that’s what the nurse mentioned. It’s an irregular heart rhythm that can sometimes lead to fluid buildup in the legs. However, there are other possibilities too, so we need to do some further testing to get a clear picture. I’m going to order an EKG, that's an electrocardiogram, to check your heart rhythm. And a blood test to rule out any other potential causes for the swelling. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. An EKG and a blood test… if that's what you think is best, then please do. I want to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. Where will we do these tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of teaching to do next week, I hope it won't interfere too much.
DOCTOR: The EKG we can do right here in the office, it just takes a few minutes. The blood test will be sent to the lab; the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend you elevate your leg whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing if you can. We’ll adjust your work schedule as needed once we know more. Given your age and lack of insurance, I also want to discuss some options for affordable cardiac care if further testing or treatment is required. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you to think of that, Doctor. Insurance is… a bit of a worry, yes. I haven't really got any. So, affordable care… that would be very much appreciated, if you don’t mind. And elevating my leg, I can manage that easily enough. Thank you for being so thorough. Perhaps this isn’t as frightening as I first thought.
DOCTOR: We'll take it one step at a time. Let's get that EKG done first, and then we can discuss the affordable care options more fully. Just lie back on the exam table, and I'll explain everything as I go. It doesn't hurt at all.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Lead the way. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and breathe normally. We're just recording your heart's electrical activity. This won't take long. …Okay, looking at this… it confirms an irregular rhythm. Specifically, atrial fibrillation. We'll need to discuss treatment options, but for now, we have a diagnosis. Alright, Nixon. The EKG showed atrial fibrillation, as we suspected. We need to talk about managing this, and what that looks like. This isn't something we can ignore, but it's also often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. Do you have any immediate questions before we dive into that?
PATIENT: Atrial fibrillation… is that… bad? Medication and lifestyle changes… what sort of changes? I don’t think I've ever been on medication before. And what about the swelling? Will it go away? It's just… a lot to take in all at once, I suppose. Is this something I’ll have to live with forever?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. It is a lot, I understand. Atrial fibrillation isn't immediately life-threatening in most cases, but it does increase your risk of stroke and can cause symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. That’s why it’s important to manage it. The medication we'd likely consider is a blood thinner to reduce the stroke risk, and potentially something to slow down your heart rate. As for the swelling, that's often a direct result of the irregular rhythm, so managing the AFib should help. Lifestyle changes would include avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, managing stress, and staying hydrated. Whether it’s something you live with “forever” depends on several factors. Sometimes it can be controlled with medication, other times more intervention is needed. We will monitor your condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Let’s not jump to conclusions. I'm going to print out some information about atrial fibrillation for you to read, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, thank you. Information to read, and a follow-up appointment… that gives me something to focus on. Print the information, please. And could you perhaps explain a little more about these medications? What sort of side effects might I expect? I’ve heard… things, about medications. I don't want to feel… unwell, just to manage my heart.
DOCTOR: Here's some information about atrial fibrillation. It covers the basics, treatment options, and potential complications. You’re right to ask about side effects. Any medication can have them, and it’s important to be aware of the possibilities. The blood thinner we'd likely consider, like warfarin, requires regular blood tests to monitor its effectiveness and prevent bleeding. Potential side effects include easy bruising, nosebleeds, and in rare cases, more serious bleeding. The medication to slow your heart rate can cause fatigue, dizziness, or low blood pressure. However, these side effects aren’t common in everyone, and we’ll monitor you closely to minimize any risks. It’s crucial to report any unusual symptoms to me immediately. We’ll also discuss alternative options if you experience any adverse effects. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss your concerns and start a treatment plan. In the meantime, please read this information, and write down any questions you have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Write down questions… I will do that. A follow-up appointment… that's good. Is there anything I should avoid doing, in the meantime? Any particular foods? Or exercises? I do enjoy a good walk, but I wouldn't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Good question. In the meantime, it's best to avoid strenuous exercise until we get your heart rate under control. A light walk is probably fine, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. As for food, avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, as these can trigger irregular heartbeats. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Also, it's important to inform me of any other medications or supplements you're taking, as these can interact with the medications we may prescribe. I'm going to print out a list of foods and activities to avoid, and a list of questions to bring to your follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be very helpful, thank you, Doctor. Lists are good. It helps to have things written down, to keep track of everything. I’m… still a little worried, but I feel a bit better knowing that we have a plan. When is the follow-up appointment? And… is it okay if I call if I have questions before then? Just… if something unexpected happens.
DOCTOR: Here are the lists of foods to avoid and questions to bring to your follow-up. Absolutely, please call if you have any questions before then. That’s what I’m here for. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. The clinic number is on the paperwork I gave you. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on staying hydrated and avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol. We'll figure this out together. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you very much for being so patient and explaining everything so clearly. I will read this carefully, and I will call if anything happens. Tuesday at 10:00 AM… I have that written down. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And remember, we’ll work through this together. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Take care.
PATIENT: .
