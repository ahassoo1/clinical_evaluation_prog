DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Demondre is fine. Well, I ain't really sick sick. Just… curious, I guess. Heard good things about this place and thought I'd come get a check-up. Haven’t been to a doctor in a while, truth be told.
DOCTOR: “A check-up.” Right. Preventative care is… admirable, I suppose. Though usually people come when something is actively wrong. Still. We can indulge you. Haven’t been to a doctor in a while… how long is “a while,” exactly?
PATIENT: Uh… a good few years. Maybe five? Six? Time kinda gets away from me when I’m on the ships, you know? Lots of long stretches at sea. I mostly just deal with the ship’s medic for little stuff. Cuts, bruises, that kinda thing. Nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: “Ships.” Interesting. And what exactly do you do on these ships, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: I'm a sailor, mostly. And a marine oiler. Keep the engines running smooth, that's what I do. It's… hard work, but honest. Lots of time away, though. Travel all over, really. Mostly cargo, not passengers. Big freighters, that kinda thing.
DOCTOR: Cargo… right. And has this… occupation caused you any particular health concerns?
PATIENT: Well… not really concerns, exactly. It’s just… physical, you know? My back gets a little sore sometimes from lifting stuff, and my hands get kinda rough. And being on the water… sometimes I get a little motion sickness when the seas are rough. Nothing I can't handle, though. It's just… part of the job. I was hoping maybe a check-up would catch anything before it becomes a problem, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: “Before it becomes a problem.” Proactive, I suppose. Though most of these issues are… predictable occupational hazards. Fine. Let’s start with a basic review. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. And I don't take any regular medicines. Maybe a painkiller for a headache now and then, but that's about it. The ship's medic always asks, of course, but I always tell him the same thing. No allergies. I'd know if I was allergic to something, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “I reckon.” Right. And what about past medical history?
PATIENT: Uh… not much, really. When I was a kid, I had the usual stuff. Chickenpox, measles, that kinda thing. Broke my arm once falling out of a tree. But nothing serious. No big illnesses, no hospital stays… just the regular bumps and bruises you get growing up. As an adult… nothing. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Except for the divorce, but that ain't a medical thing, right?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Heindel, a divorce is not a medical thing. Let’s stick to the physical. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Hmm. My mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa, on her side, he had something with his heart. But that was a long time ago. On my dad’s side… not really sure, to be honest. Didn't really keep in touch with them much. They lived pretty far away, and I haven’t seen them in years. I don't know much about their health, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Makes sense.” Let’s move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always seemed kinda silly to me. And my dad smoked, and… well, he didn't live a long life. So, no. Not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not a lot, though. A beer with dinner now and then, maybe a couple on a weekend. Never really been a big drinker. Mostly just when I'm back on shore and hanging out with friends. When I'm on the ships, not so much. It's kinda frowned upon, you know? I'd say… a couple of drinks a week, tops.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to step on the scale, and we'll start from there.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Hopefully I ain’t gained too much weight since I was last on land! This ship's cook makes some amazing food.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. Weight is 91 kilograms, height 183 centimeters… Heart sounds are regular, a little quick, but nothing concerning. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Let’s check your reflexes. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Never been good at these things, to be honest. Always felt a little clumsy. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… present, but a little diminished. Not drastically, but something to note. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you touch your toes?
PATIENT: Sure. Oof. Back's a little stiff today, Doctor. Been a long few months at sea. Getting old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “Getting old.” A common complaint. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m all yours.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright, Mr. Heindel, you can sit up. Everything seems… within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated and your reflexes are a little diminished. Given your history, it could be related to your occupation. We should repeat the blood pressure check in a few months, and I recommend staying hydrated and stretching regularly. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, Doctor. Hydrate and stretch… I can definitely do that. Hmm… actually, yeah, I do have a question. Sometimes, when I come back on land after being at sea for a while, I get kinda… dizzy. Not all the time, but it happens. Is that something I should be worried about? Maybe it’s just getting used to being on solid ground again?
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon returning to land… that could be related to postural hypotension, or simply inner ear imbalance from being on the ship. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we should investigate further to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or nausea accompanying the dizziness?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. No hearing loss, no ringing… sometimes I feel a little queasy, but I figured that was just from the rocking of the ship finally stopping. It usually goes away after a day or two. It's just kinda… unsettling, you know? Feeling wobbly and off-balance. I never really thought much of it, to be honest. Just figured it was part of being a sailor.
DOCTOR: “Part of being a sailor.” Perhaps. However, given your blood pressure and this dizziness, I’d like to order a basic blood workup to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. And I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a hearing test, just to be safe. It’s better to be thorough. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a hearing test… alright. I can do that. I guess it’s better to know for sure. Where do I go for those tests? And will my Medicare cover it? I don’t wanna get stuck with a big bill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. I’ll write you a referral to Coastal Labs for the blood work, and to SoundCheck Audiology for the hearing test. Both are covered under Medicare, but you may have a small co-pay. I’ll have my assistant print out the paperwork and instructions for you. The results will be sent to my office, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment in four weeks. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated, stretch regularly, and monitor your blood pressure at home if you have access to a monitor. Any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Four weeks… okay. That sounds good. No, I don’t think so. I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my… rambling. I’ll go see my assistant now and get the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Heindel. We’ll see you in four weeks.
PATIENT: .
