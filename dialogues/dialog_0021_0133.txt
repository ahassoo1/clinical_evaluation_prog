DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's Melvenia Tippens. Um, I need some forms signed, actually. Just some health things... verification, you know? For… stuff. I hope it's not too much trouble. I don't really like being at the doctor's long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Forms, alright. It's… always something with forms. I suppose I can take a look. Though, usually with verification, there's something underlying it. Just signing blindly isn't really… good medicine, you know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I understand. It's just... I'm trying to get approved for a little assistance program. It’s nothing serious, really. Just to help with… costs. I haven’t been feeling too well lately, and everything is so expensive these days. I don't have insurance, so… It just needs a doctor's signature to say I'm who I say I am and that I need the help. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Right, assistance program. Of course. Still, these programs like to be thorough. It's not just about a signature, you see. They want to know why you need assistance. What’s been going on that’s making you not feel well?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I figured it might be something like that. Well, it's just...my joints ache something awful. Especially in the mornings. Makes getting out of bed a real struggle. And I get tired so easily. Even walking to the mailbox feels like a marathon these days. I just thought it was getting old, but my daughter, bless her heart, insisted I see someone. She’s worried. I haven't really told anyone else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Aches and fatigue… Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started… probably about six months ago, I’d say. Not all at once, you know? Just little things at first. A bit of stiffness in my hands. Then the tiredness crept in. It’s gotten worse steadily since then. It’s hard to keep track of time, at my age, honestly. But definitely at least six months.
DOCTOR: Six months... Alright. And anything else?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. I just don't feel hungry like I used to. And I've been having a bit of trouble sleeping, too. Not every night, but often enough that it's bothersome. I wake up feeling… restless, you know? And sometimes my hands feel… numb, a little. It comes and goes, though. It’s nothing terrible, really. Just little things.
DOCTOR: Little things add up, Melvenia. We'll have to take a look, just to be thorough. Let’s just check your reflexes and a few other things. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure, whatever you think is best, Doctor. Um, swelling… not much, really. Maybe a little around my knuckles sometimes, but it's not noticeable unless I really look. And sometimes my ankles feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I figured that was just from being on my feet too long. I don't know…
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes seem… reasonably intact. A little sluggish, perhaps, but not alarming. Let’s take a listen to your heart and lungs, just to be complete. Please take a deep breath for me...and another one...
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Doctor, I’m a bit embarrassed to admit this, but sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not always, but when I climb stairs or walk uphill, I get a little short of breath. It usually goes away if I rest. But… it’s been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Tightness and shortness of breath… and does this come on suddenly, or does it build gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, it builds gradually, Doctor. It doesn’t just hit me all at once. I notice it getting harder and harder to breathe as I exert myself. It usually goes away pretty quickly when I stop and rest. It just… limits what I can do, you know? I used to love gardening, but now I can barely do ten minutes without getting winded.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain with this, or is it just shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Well… not really pain, exactly. More of a… pressure, maybe? A tightness in my chest. It’s not sharp or stabbing, just… uncomfortable. Like someone’s sitting on my chest. And sometimes… it radiates into my left shoulder, a little. Not all the time, though. Just occasionally.
DOCTOR: Radiating pain… pressure… Alright, Melvenia. This is a bit more concerning than I initially thought. We're going to need to get some tests done. I’m going to order a chest x-ray and an EKG to rule out any heart issues. And some bloodwork to check for inflammation and other potential causes. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests? That doesn't sound good, does it? Um… allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve had some tests done before, years ago, when I broke my wrist, and I didn't have any problems then. But it was a long time ago, Doctor. I can’t really remember all the details. Is… is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's better to be thorough, Melvenia. I’m not saying it is serious, but with the symptoms you’re describing – the chest tightness, the shortness of breath, the radiating pain – it's important to rule out anything potentially concerning. We need to see what's going on before we can say anything definitive. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the x-ray and EKG for you. And we'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any severe chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Emergency room… that sounds frightening. Yes, Doctor, I understand. No strenuous activity, and go to the ER if it gets bad. I just... I wish it wasn't so complicated. It’s just getting old, isn’t it? . Will this affect getting the assistance program approved, do you think? I really need that help.
DOCTOR: Well, Melvenia, the assistance program… it’s hard to say. It depends on their specific requirements. But having documented medical concerns might actually help your case, not hinder it. It shows a legitimate need for assistance. We’ll focus on getting you diagnosed and treated, and then we can address the paperwork later. For now, let's get those tests scheduled. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have a preference for where you’d like the tests done?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring, actually. About the program, I mean. Okay, the nurse… alright. Um… I guess anywhere is fine. The hospital down the street is probably easiest. I don’t really want to go too far, if I can avoid it. I get tired easily, you know? . Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel like a silly old woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will set everything up at St. Luke's. Try to take it easy, Melvenia. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And I assure you, your concerns are not silly. Getting proper treatment is important at any age. I'll have the nurse give you some written instructions, as well as the information for the assistance program. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
