DOCTOR: Hi Venna, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure's been actin' up, that's what the lady on the phone said I needed to come in for. It's been high, I guess. Don't really know much about it, to be honest. Just know I feel kinda tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that's perfectly alright. We can figure this out together. "Actin' up" is a good way to put it. And feeling tired can definitely be related. First, let’s talk a little bit about this blood pressure. Do you know roughly when you first noticed it might be high?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question. Not sure exactly when. Maybe a few months ago? My son, Dale, he got me one of them machines to check it with. He was worried, said I needed to keep an eye on it. That's when I started noticing it was higher than it used to be, I reckon. But before that...hard to say. I don't really pay attention to numbers much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months ago, and Dale got you a home monitor – that’s good awareness. And it’s alright not being a numbers person, we’ll work with that. Can you tell me what kind of readings you’ve been getting on the machine, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, numbers... Dale showed me what was good and what was bad. I think...it was usually up around 150 somethin' over 90 somethin'. Sometimes higher. He got real concerned when it went over 160. I mostly just tried not to look at it too much after that, honestly. Makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Okay, 150s over 90s, and sometimes over 160 – that is higher than we like to see. Dale sounds like a good son, looking out for you. Don’t worry, we'll get this checked out. To get a better picture, I'd like to check your blood pressure myself today, and also ask you a few questions about your health history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just want to feel better. My old bones ain't what they used to be, and bein' tired all the time ain't helpin'. Go ahead and check it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to wrap this around your arm. Try to relax, and don’t talk while I’m taking the reading, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Relax...easier said than done sometimes! But I'll try my best. You just let me know if it pinches too tight, alright? Old lady skin is kinda sensitive.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't pinch, but please tell me right away if it does. Okay, here we go... Okay, that was 168 over 92. And just to be sure, I'll take it again in a few minutes. While we wait, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Well, now...let me think. The doctor back home, before I moved closer to Dale, he said somethin' about my joints. Arthritis, I think it was called. Makes my hands ache somethin' awful sometimes. And I've always had a bit of trouble with my stomach, gets upset easy. But nothin' too serious, never been on any special medicine for it. Oh, and I had my gallbladder taken out years ago, but that was a long time ago. Don't think that's botherin' me now.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your joints, some stomach trouble, and gallbladder removal years ago. That’s helpful to know. And it sounds like the gallbladder removal hasn't been a recent issue. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis when it's bad. It's called ibuprofen, I think. Dale gets it for me. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little somethin' with melatonin in it. Just when I really can't rest, mind you. I don't like takin' pills if I don't have to. Mostly just try to get by on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for arthritis and melatonin occasionally for sleep. That's good to know. It's good you're mindful of taking only what you need. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mama, she passed when I was young. I don't really remember her bein' sick with much. My daddy...he had a weak heart, I think. Didn't take care of himself, smoked a lot. And my brother, he had some trouble with his sugar, but that was after he got real old. We didn't talk much about health stuff back then, didn't have the money for doctors like we do now. So I don't know much for sure. It was mostly just folks passin' on, one way or another.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had a weak heart and your brother had trouble with sugar later in life. That gives us something to work with. Now, just a few more questions. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with allergies. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes when the pollen's bad in the spring, but that's all. Never been to the hospital for an allergy attack or nothin'. Dale's always askin' if I'm sure, but I tell him I'm a Cherokee woman, we're tough! We grow up with all sorts of plants and things, builds up a resistance, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Venna. Cherokee resilience is something to be proud of. Okay, so no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... Well, I mostly stay at home now. Dale checks on me a lot, makes sure I'm eatin' right. I used to be a baker, see. Had my own little shop for years, but my hands started hurtin' too bad. Now I just bake little things for the grandkids. I don't go out much, mostly just readin' and watchin' TV. And I try to take a little walk in the yard when the weather's nice. Not much excitement, but it's a peaceful life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Venna. A peaceful life is a good life. Baking for the grandkids is lovely. Okay, let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better overall picture. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead, Doctor. Just be gentle with my hands, they're kinda sensitive, like I said. And don't mind if I close my eyes... sometimes the exam table makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be very gentle with your hands, and you close your eyes if that makes you more comfortable. Just let me know if you feel dizzy at any point. Heart sounds are a little bit strong, but no murmurs that I can detect right now. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Pulse is a little fast, but regular. Okay, some swelling and redness in the joints, as expected. Feet also show some mild swelling. Alright, Venna, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and the exam, your blood pressure is elevated, and you have some signs of arthritis in your hands and feet. The fast pulse and strong heart sounds are something we need to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound too good. So what does it mean, Doctor? Is it somethin' serious? I just want to feel better, that's all. I don't want to be stuck inside all the time, unable to bake for my grandkids.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions, Venna. It is something we need to address, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to problems like heart disease or stroke, but we can manage it with medication and lifestyle changes. The arthritis is causing your joint pain and swelling, and we can also treat that to help you feel more comfortable. Right now, I'm thinking the most important thing is to get your blood pressure under control. I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health and to rule out any other possible causes for your high blood pressure. I also want to do an EKG, which is a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests... alright. More pokin' and proddin', I reckon. But if it'll help, then yes. Do what you need to do, Doctor. My Dale always says I gotta listen to the doctors. He worries somethin' awful. And... what about the medicine for my blood pressure? What kind is it? And will it make me feel all tired and stuff? I don't want to be too sleepy to visit with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: It's good you have Dale looking out for you. The tests are just to get a clearer picture, and they don’t take long. As for medication, there are a lot of different options for high blood pressure. I’m thinking we'll start with a low dose of a medication called a thiazide diuretic – it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water, which can lower your blood pressure. It’s generally well-tolerated, but some people do experience a little fatigue at first. We can always adjust the dose or try a different medication if you don’t feel well on it. We'll start low and go slow, and I’ll check your blood pressure regularly to make sure it's working. It’s important to take the medication as prescribed, even if you’re feeling fine. Would you like me to explain anything about the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Tests... hmm. What exactly do they do in those tests? I don't like needles much, and I get kinda nervous when folks start pokin' around. What about the EKG? Does that one involve needles too? Just tryin' to brace myself, you know? Old lady nerves, I reckon. And...will Dale be able to come with me when I have them done? He's good at keepin' me calm.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Venna. It's good you're asking, and I’m happy to explain. The blood tests are pretty simple. A nurse will just take a small sample of blood from your arm with a needle – it's a quick pinch, and then it’s over. We're looking at things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. The EKG is even less invasive. They'll put some small, sticky patches called electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches don't hurt at all – they just detect the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles. It's painless and takes only a few minutes. And yes, absolutely, Dale can come with you when you have the tests done. Having someone there for support is a great idea. In fact, I encourage it. You can both ask questions, and he can help keep you calm. I will put a note in your chart that he will be accompanying you. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. No needles for the EKG, that's good. And Dale can come with me... that's a relief. He worries so much, he'll want to be there anyways. Okay. So what do I need to do now? When can I get these tests done? And...how often do I need to see you after that? I don't want to be comin' to the doctor too much. I like my peaceful life, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. I’m glad we could address your concerns. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work today, right here in the office, before you leave. The lab results usually take a couple of days to come back. Then, we’ll schedule you for the EKG at the imaging center down the street – it's a quick appointment, usually less than 30 minutes. Once we have the results from both tests, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and start you on a medication plan. I'm thinking we'll see you back in about a week, and then we can monitor your blood pressure regularly – probably every few weeks at first, and then less often as it gets under control. I understand you like your peaceful life, and I want to help you maintain that. We’ll work together to find a plan that works for you, with the least amount of disruption possible. The goal is to get your blood pressure under control so you can continue to enjoy your life and bake for your grandkids. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. A week for the follow-up, that's good. And Dale can come with me, that's the most important thing. Alright. Let's get this blood work done then. The sooner I get this over with, the better. Just try to be gentle with the needle, alright? And tell the nurse I'm a Cherokee woman... we don't like pain much!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will personally let the nurse know. And I’ll make sure she's extra gentle. You are in good hands, Venna. Let me go get the nurse now, and we’ll get this done quickly. I’ll be right back. Dale, if you'd like to wait in the waiting room, you are more than welcome.
