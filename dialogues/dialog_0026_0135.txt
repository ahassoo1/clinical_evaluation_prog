DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I have… a problem with my ear. There is something… leaking from it. A discharge, you could say. It started maybe one week ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear for about a week now. Alright. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. How to explain… It is… not much. A little bit. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes… a little bit yellow. Not smelly, though. I clean it with a tissue, but it comes back. It does not hurt, but… it is uncomfortable, yes? Like something is… wet inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear to slightly yellow discharge, not smelly, and it’s been happening for about a week. You said it doesn't hurt, just feels wet and uncomfortable. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes… a little bit of ringing in the ear. Not all the time. And… maybe my hearing is not as good as before, in that ear. Just a little. It is difficult to explain. Like sounds are… muffled. Not very loud, but… different. Also, I feel… a little dizzy sometimes. Not falling down dizzy, but… lightheaded, yes? Like when you stand up too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ear, some muffled hearing, and occasional lightheadedness. Thank you for explaining so clearly. Now, have you had any ear infections before, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had… many ear problems. A bad infection, I think. The doctor… he cleaned my ear with water, and gave me some… drops. It got better then. But… many years ago. I have not had trouble with my ears since… until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of ear infections in your youth. That’s good to know. And have you had any injuries to your ear or head recently?
PATIENT: No. No injuries. I am careful. I work at the college, teaching. I sit mostly. No running, no… hitting my head. Nothing like that. I have not been sick… not with a cold or anything, either. Just the ear problem. It is… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injuries or illness. Annoying is a good way to put it. I’d like to take a look at your ear now, if that’s alright with you. We'll use an otoscope, it doesn’t hurt, just lets me see inside. Would you mind sitting down in the examination chair?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. I will sit down. An otoscope, you say? It does not hurt? Good. I am… not good with pain. I will sit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No, it shouldn't hurt at all. It just allows me to visualize the ear canal and eardrum. Okay… I do see some discharge in the left ear canal, as you described. The eardrum appears slightly cloudy, and there's some redness. The right ear looks normal. It looks like you have otitis externa – an outer ear infection – in your left ear. It’s fairly common. Do you feel any pain when I gently tug on your earlobe?
PATIENT: Hmm. Tug on the earlobe? Yes… a little bit of discomfort, yes. Not bad pain, but… I feel it. Like… a small pinch. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s not uncommon with otitis externa. It indicates some inflammation in the ear canal. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have not taken many medicines. When I was younger… some medicine for a fever, maybe. But nothing… regularly. I do not have allergies, no. Not to food, not to anything. I do not know if that is good or bad.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Radillo, I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops – antibiotic and steroid combination – to help clear the infection and reduce the inflammation. It's important to finish the entire course of drops, even if your ear starts to feel better. I will also give you some pain relief medication – ibuprofen – for any discomfort. I'd like you to keep your ear dry for the next few days – avoid swimming or getting water in your ear when you shower. We'll need to see you in one week to check on your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Ear drops, and pain medicine. Keep the ear dry. One week. That sounds alright. Will the drops… hurt? And how do I… put them in? I have never used ear drops before.
DOCTOR: No, the drops shouldn’t hurt at all. They might feel a little cool when they go in, but they shouldn’t cause any pain. As for putting them in, I'll have the nurse show you exactly how to do it before you leave. Essentially, you'll warm the drops by holding the bottle in your hand for a few minutes. Then, you'll tilt your head to the side, pull your ear slightly up and back, and put a few drops into the ear canal. You'll want to stay tilted for about five minutes to allow the drops to reach the eardrum. Do you think you'll be able to manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Warm the bottle. Tilt my head. Pull my ear. Five minutes. I can remember that. The nurse will show me? That is good. I am… a little nervous, but I will try. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. And don't worry, it's perfectly normal to be a little nervous. The nurse will walk you through everything step-by-step. She's very good at explaining things. I’ll give you a printed summary of today’s visit and instructions as well. If you experience any worsening pain, fever, or dizziness, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is all. The nurse will help me with the drops. And if something is wrong, I will call. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. You have been very… helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Please take care, and I’ll see you in one week. .
PATIENT: Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you.
