DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, I… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about… yellowing? A patient of mine, quite a while ago now, started looking rather… jaundiced, I believe the term is. And they have… liver trouble. Or something of that nature. It’s all rather hazy, I’m afraid. I just want to be sure everything is alright. I do apologize for my confusion.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. Memory can be quite fickle. It’s very sensible of you to come in and get things checked out, especially with a history like that. So, you’re concerned about potential yellowing, perhaps of the skin or eyes, and you're thinking about possible liver issues. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me if you have noticed any yellowing yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not me, Doctor. Goodness, no. It was a patient. A long time ago. A man, I believe. Though… details escape me. I'm a medical dosimetrist, you see, and I don't directly treat patients. I calculate the radiation. So I only see them briefly. It’s the… the worry of it happening again, to someone else, that brought me in. I suppose. It's all very unsettling. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Durig. It’s very thoughtful of you to be concerned about the well-being of others, and perfectly understandable that a past experience would bring you in for a check-up. It sounds like you’re experiencing some anxiety related to a previous patient’s illness. Let’s put that aside for a moment, and just focus on your health today. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any changes you have noticed in your own body recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… let me think. I haven't been feeling terribly unwell, truthfully. A bit tired, perhaps. Old age, you know. But nothing… alarming. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. I do try to eat a balanced diet. And… I haven’t noticed any pain, or… unusual anything, really. I just… I worry. That’s all. I suppose my concern is overshadowing everything. I wish I could be more helpful. Is this… necessary? Perhaps it’s a false alarm.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Durig. You are being very helpful simply by sharing your concerns with me. And it’s never a waste of time to address worry, especially when it’s prompted by a past experience. You mentioned feeling a bit tired. Has this tiredness been a recent change, or is it something you’ve experienced for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that’s a good question. It’s… crept up on me, I think. Not sudden. It wasn’t like one day I was full of energy and the next I wasn’t. Just… a gradual lessening. I attribute it to the years, mostly. But I suppose it’s good to rule things out. It's just… all these questions. Are you finding something wrong? I do hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Durig. You’re not wasting my time in the slightest. It's very important to investigate any changes, even gradual ones. And ruling things out is a very positive step. To get a more complete picture, let’s do a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that is a difficult question. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve probably had all the usual ailments one accumulates over the years. Nothing… serious, I don’t believe. A touch of arthritis, perhaps. And… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. But that was… routine. I’m afraid my memory for specifics is… dreadful. Would it be helpful if I brought my records? I believe I have some somewhere… though finding them might be a task.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. We can certainly take things at your pace. If you are able to locate your records, that would be helpful, but don't worry if you can’t. We can proceed without them. You mentioned arthritis and gallbladder removal. Are you currently experiencing any pain related to the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, the arthritis… it flares up from time to time. Mostly in my hands and knees. Nothing debilitating, Doctor. I manage it with over-the-counter remedies. A little ibuprofen, that sort of thing. It's more of a… stiffness, really. Not a sharp pain. And… honestly, I think I've just gotten used to it. It’s a part of life, you know? I suppose I should be more diligent about it, but… I tend to ignore things until they become unbearable. Is that… wise? I doubt it.
DOCTOR: It's quite common to manage mild arthritis with over-the-counter remedies, and it sounds like you're doing a reasonable job of it. It's good that it's not debilitating. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, besides the ibuprofen you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just the ibuprofen, Doctor. And a little vitamin D supplement in the winter. The sun isn't what it used to be, you know. And… occasionally, a mild laxative. Old age, again. Everything slows down. I apologize for rambling. I feel like I’m not being very helpful. I really should have brought my records. This is all so… disorganized. Perhaps I should just stop. Is there anything you would like to know specifically?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly alright. Knowing what you aren’t taking is just as important as knowing what you are. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t believe so, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. A little sneezing in the spring, perhaps. But nothing serious. I do have… sensitive skin, if that counts. But it’s more of an irritation than a true allergy. I tend to use unscented products, just to be safe. I always thought it was better to err on the side of caution. This is all… quite exhausting, isn’t it? I apologize for my… lack of focus. I really must stop rambling.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Ms. Durig. You're doing just fine. It's good that you haven't experienced any significant allergies. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My family… that’s a complicated question. My parents are both gone now, and I didn’t… keep close track of their medical history. They lived long lives, I believe. But they weren’t ones to… discuss ailments. My mother had… some sort of heart trouble, I think. But it was a long time ago. And my father… I honestly can’t recall. I apologize. My memory is… a sieve. I really wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps this is a waste of your time. I should just stop. .
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can proceed without it. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
