DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta, good to meet you. Eighty-seven years young, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Though some days I feel a good bit older! It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? My memory isn't quite what it used to be, you see. But please, call me Nicoletta.
DOCTOR: Yes, Burlingham. Dr. Burlingham. It’s perfectly normal at your age to have a bit of forgetfulness, dear. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain exactly… I just feel… worn down. Not sick, exactly, but… like I need a little… boost. A reset, perhaps? My daughter suggested I come in. She said I wasn’t myself lately, and maybe a check-up would help. I want to feel more… energetic, you know? I used to be so active, always gardening and with the grandchildren… now, everything feels like a bit of a chore.
DOCTOR: “Worn down,” you say. And your daughter prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. Bless her heart, Maria worries so. She’s a very practical woman. She said I haven't been keeping up with things, and that I seemed…listless. I don't like feeling this way. I’ve always been a doer, and now… well, I mostly sit. I still enjoy visitors, of course, but even that takes more effort than it used to. It’s just… not as fulfilling. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It… vaguely. “Listless” isn’t a medical term, dear. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… that is hard. Let me think. It's like… everything takes so much energy. Even getting dressed in the morning feels like a task. And I used to bake, you know? Beautiful cakes for everyone. But the thought of measuring and mixing… it just feels overwhelming now. And I sleep a lot more than I used to, but I still feel tired when I wake up. I don’t have any pain, not really, just… a lack of… oomph. Is that any better? I’m sorry I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Lack of “oomph.” We'll work with that. So, no pain, increased sleep, fatigue persists despite resting, and difficulty with activities you used to enjoy. Do you find yourself losing interest in things altogether, or is it simply the effort of doing them that’s the problem?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s mostly the effort, I think. I want to garden, I miss the feel of the soil and the smell of the flowers. I still love looking at the garden, and I enjoy when my grandchildren visit. I don't think I've lost interest in the things themselves, just... the energy to do them. It’s like there’s a… a weight holding me back. Does that make any sense at all? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It's… becoming clearer. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – anything at all – over the years?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Let me see… well, years ago, when I was still teaching, I had a bout of shingles. Very painful, that was. And I had my gallbladder removed, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. Other than that… not much. High blood pressure, the doctor told me, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time. And arthritis, of course, in my hands. But it’s just a little stiffness, nothing debilitating. Oh! And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped in the garden, but it healed up fine. Is that helpful? I always worry I’ll forget something important.
DOCTOR: Shingles, gallbladder removal, hypertension controlled with medication, and arthritis in the hands. Good. We'll make a note of those. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me see… I keep it in my purse. Here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a small white pill with it every morning, the doctor said it was for… oh dear, I’ve forgotten the name. Something about keeping my heart steady. It’s a tiny little pill, though. My daughter refills everything for me, so I don't have to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and… a small white pill. That’s… less than ideal, dear. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can recall. But it was so long ago, when my children were small, that I had any medications at all. Honestly, I can’t remember. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? I hope I’m not being too much trouble with all my forgetting. It’s just… frustrating!
DOCTOR: "Lucky." Alright. Now, before we proceed, let’s take a quick look at your vitals. Just a routine check. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. I always feel a bit silly stepping on these things. I haven't weighed myself in ages! Hopefully, it’s not too bad. My daughter is always fussing over my weight, you know. She means well, of course. Here we go…
DOCTOR: 149 pounds. And your height is listed as 5’10”, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Five feet ten inches. Always been tall for a Chamorro woman, you know. My grandfather was a sailor, and I suppose I got his height. Though I haven’t been that tall since I started shrinking a little with age! I used to be so proud of my height, but now… well, it just makes me feel more noticeable when I’m feeling unsteady.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Let’s just do a quick neurological exam, just to rule things out. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I used to do puzzles with my grandchildren, so my eyes are still pretty good, I think. Though sometimes they get a bit tired after reading for a while. I love a good mystery novel, you know. They keep my mind sharp.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal, grip strength is adequate. Gait is slightly slow, but stable. Now, just a few questions about your daily life. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband, Antonio, passed away about ten years ago. It's quiet, sometimes too quiet. But I have Maria and her family nearby, and they visit often. She’s a good daughter, always checking in on me. And I have my neighbors, they’re very kind. I manage alright, mostly. Though doing things around the house is getting harder, you know? I used to be so independent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta. Based on what you’ve told me, and the limited exam I've conducted, it sounds like you’re experiencing a constellation of symptoms – fatigue, decreased energy, a feeling of being “worn down” – coupled with some mild age-related decline. It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific cause without further investigation. However, given your age, and the fact that you’re currently on Lisinopril, we need to rule out a few possibilities. We'll start with some blood work. A complete blood count to check for anemia, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We should also check your B12 level, as a deficiency can cause fatigue and weakness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work… well, it’s not my favorite thing, but if it will help, then yes, of course. You do what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Anemia, thyroid… I don't really know what any of that means, but if it will help me feel better, I’m happy to do it. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? When can we get that done?
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will draw some blood right now. It’ll take a few days to get the results back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active, as much as you’re able, and maintain a healthy diet. And try not to worry too much. Most likely, it’s just a simple vitamin deficiency or a minor imbalance. Now, the nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: Well… just one. You mentioned a vitamin deficiency. Is there anything I can start doing now, maybe eat certain things, to help a little bit before the results come back? Something simple, you know? I still like to cook, and I’d like to try and help myself if I can. And… is it alright if Maria comes with me to the follow-up appointment? I sometimes forget things, and it’s nice to have her there to take notes.
DOCTOR: As for dietary changes... increase your intake of foods rich in iron – leafy green vegetables, lean meats – and Vitamin D – fatty fish, eggs. Though, frankly, the effect will be minimal until we know what deficiency, if any, is present. It's not as if you can simply “eat your way” better. And yes, your daughter is welcome to accompany you to the follow-up. However, please refrain from interrupting during the consultation. I need to be able to focus on you and your medical history, not a second opinion from a family member. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. I understand. I'll try the leafy greens and the fish. And I’ll be sure to remind Maria to let me do the talking. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to feel like myself again.
