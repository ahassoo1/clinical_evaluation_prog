DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been treated for sleep apnea for a while now – using a machine at night, you know – and it should be helping, but I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use. I understand. Let's get a bit more detail about that. First, how long has this been going on, even with the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been… well, I started the machine about, oh, three years ago now, maybe a little more. And it was wonderful at first! I felt like a new man. But this tiredness crept back, I’d say… about six months ago, maybe eight. It’s been gradually getting worse since then. Not suddenly, thankfully. Just… a slow slide back into feeling sluggish all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three years on CPAP, good initial response, and then a gradual return of symptoms over the last six to eight months. And you said “sluggish”?
PATIENT: Yes, sluggish is a good word. Not exactly exhausted, like I couldn’t function, but… just heavy. Like wading through water. I don’t have the energy to do the things I used to, even things I enjoy. And sometimes, I just… nod off. Not while driving, thankfully! But sitting in my chair, reading… or even talking to people sometimes. It's embarrassing, really. I don't want to be that person.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. Let’s talk about the machine itself. Are you consistently using it every night?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I am. Religiously. I wouldn’t dare skip it, knowing what it’s supposed to do. I put it on as soon as my head hits the pillow. I’ve got it set up just right, I think. Comfortable mask, everything. I check the numbers on the display every morning, and it seems to be doing its job. I always try to use it for at least eight hours. Sometimes a little more. I really do.
DOCTOR: Good. Consistent use is excellent. The numbers you’re checking – can you tell me what those are, roughly?
PATIENT: Well, there’s a number that shows the pressure, I think. It varies, of course, depending on how I’m sleeping. It usually goes between, oh, 8 and 12, I’d say. And then there’s another number, a higher one, that shows… I think it’s how many times I stopped breathing each hour? The technician explained it when they first set it up, but it's all a bit of a blur now. It used to be quite high, before I started the machine, but now it’s usually below 5. Sometimes even below 2. That's what I check most often, really. The apnea number. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. An AHI – Apnea-Hypopnea Index – below 5 is good, generally. Okay. Let’s shift gears a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. I’ve put on a few pounds, I’m afraid. Not a huge amount, but enough to notice in my clothes. Probably ten or fifteen pounds over the last year. It’s difficult, you know? I used to walk a lot, but with this tiredness… it’s harder to get motivated. And when I'm tired, I tend to snack more. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m about 92 kilos now, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weight gain of around 10-15 pounds over the past year, now at 92 kilograms. And you mentioned difficulty with motivation to walk. Any other changes in your daily routine or appetite?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite hasn’t really changed, no. I eat about the same as always. Maybe a little more comfort food when I'm feeling sluggish, like I said, but nothing drastic. The biggest change, besides the tiredness and the walking, is… well, I don’t sleep as well even with the machine. It’s hard to explain. I wake up several times during the night, even if it’s just for a few minutes. Not enough to get out of bed, usually, but enough to feel… restless. I used to sleep like a log. Now it’s… fragmented. Is that the right word?
DOCTOR: Fragmented is a good word. Okay, so consistent CPAP use, good AHI numbers, weight gain, and now fragmented sleep despite machine use. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my prostate checked a few years back, and that's all fine. My blood pressure is a little high, but it’s well-controlled with medication – a small dose, thankfully. And… oh, I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up completely. Nothing major, really. I'm otherwise quite healthy, for my age, I think. I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups, and he always says I'm doing well, considering. He’s the one who referred me to the sleep specialist in the first place, when I started having trouble breathing at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, history of bronchitis, and regular check-ups with your primary care doctor. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication, Doctor. A small dose of lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for my heartburn, just as needed. Something over the counter – antacids, mostly. But that's it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I really do. It always makes me feel a bit… sluggish, ironically enough. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Okay, so lisinopril for hypertension and occasional antacids. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings when I was a child, but I've never been stung, thankfully. And no food allergies either. I eat pretty much everything. I'm Spanish, you know, we like our food! It's part of our culture. I'm quite lucky, really, no allergies to speak of. I've always been a pretty healthy eater, despite the weight gain lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. My father had high blood pressure, like me. And he also had some heart trouble later in life. My mother… she had arthritis, mostly. And… my brother, he had diabetes, but that's about it, really. Nothing major, no history of sleep problems that I'm aware of. My family wasn’t a particularly… sickly bunch, all things considered. They lived long lives, mostly, even with a few health problems here and there. Is that helpful? I try to stay active, you know, to avoid the same fate.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, heart trouble, and diabetes. Now, a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never had the inclination. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to smoke, but I always hated it. I always told her it was bad for her health, and… well, she eventually quit, thankfully. But no, I've never been a smoker. And I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing more. I’m a pretty healthy fellow, all things considered. I try to be, anyway. I want to enjoy my retirement, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, let's talk a little bit about your social life. Are you living alone currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. My wife passed away about five years ago. It’s… quiet now, without her. I have a son, he lives nearby, thankfully, and he visits often. And I have a few friends I see from time to time. But mostly, it’s just me. I try to stay busy, you know? I read a lot, I volunteer at the local library, I try to keep my mind active. But it’s not the same without her. I miss her terribly. Still, I’m grateful for my health, and I try to make the best of things. It’s what she would have wanted.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Paske. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and ears. It will just take a few minutes. It’s good to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in getting checked out regularly. It’s better to be safe than sorry, you know? I’ll just sit here and relax. Please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a patient man, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Your heart and lungs sound okay, no immediate concerns there. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can address that. I'm going to document those findings now. So, putting everything together – consistent CPAP use, good AHI numbers, weight gain, fragmented sleep, slightly elevated blood pressure, family history of hypertension and diabetes – it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It's unlikely to be a simple CPAP issue, given your numbers. The weight gain could be contributing to the fatigue and fragmented sleep, and the slightly elevated blood pressure needs attention. Have you had a blood test recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't had a blood test in… oh, probably a year, maybe a little more. My primary care doctor usually orders one with my annual check-up. But that was a while ago now. I assume it was all normal then, but I don’t specifically remember. He didn’t mention anything when I saw him last, but I tend to forget things these days, you know? I’m 83, it’s to be expected. Still, I’m sure he would have told me if anything was amiss. I trust his judgment, too. But if you think it’s important, I’m happy to get one done. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: You're right to trust your primary care doctor, but a recent blood test is a good idea, given the situation. It will help us rule out things like anemia, thyroid problems, and diabetes, all of which can cause fatigue and sleep disturbances. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your Vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can sometimes cause fatigue. I’ll send the order to the lab, and they can draw the blood today. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, let’s talk about a few lifestyle changes. Have you considered trying to incorporate a little more exercise into your daily routine?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds like a good plan. I’m happy to get the blood tests done. And you’re right about the exercise. I know I should be doing more, but it’s just… difficult when I’m feeling so tired all the time. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I used to enjoy walking, like I said, but lately I just don’t have the energy. Perhaps I could start with something small? Just a short walk around the block each day? I’m not sure if I can manage much more than that, to be honest. I don't want to overdo it and exhaust myself further. But I’m willing to try. I really am. I just need a little… encouragement, perhaps. And maybe a little help getting started.
DOCTOR: That’s a great attitude, Mr. Paske. Starting small is absolutely the right approach. A short walk around the block each day is a perfect goal. Don’t push yourself, listen to your body, and gradually increase the distance as you feel stronger. I also recommend trying to maintain a healthy diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. We can discuss resources for healthy eating if you’d like. And I'd like to review your medications again, just to make sure there are no interactions causing fatigue. Do you have a list of all the medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. It's in my wallet, actually. I always carry it with me. It lists the lisinopril for my blood pressure, and the occasional antacids, as we discussed. Nothing else, really. I don't take any supplements. I've always been a bit skeptical of them, to be honest. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food, whenever possible. I’ll just stick to the walking and healthy eating, I think. That sounds manageable enough. And hopefully, the blood tests will give us a better idea of what’s going on. I’m just eager to get to the bottom of this fatigue. It’s really starting to affect my quality of life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Thank you. Lisinopril and occasional antacids – no obvious interactions there. So, to summarise: we've ordered blood tests to rule out underlying medical conditions, we’re focusing on lifestyle changes – starting with a short daily walk and healthy eating – and we’ll monitor your progress. I will have the lab results sent to me as soon as they are available, which usually takes a few days. I'll give you a call as soon as I've reviewed them to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly, and I feel much better now, knowing that we're taking steps to address this fatigue. Thank you for your time and attention. And thank you for being so patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it very much. I’ll just wait for the blood test results and see what they say. And I’ll try my best to incorporate a little more walking into my daily routine. Hopefully, that will make a difference. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Paske, that's all for today. Just try to get some rest, stay hydrated, and remember to listen to your body. The lab will send me the results, and I’ll be in touch. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m optimistic that we’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. I certainly will.
