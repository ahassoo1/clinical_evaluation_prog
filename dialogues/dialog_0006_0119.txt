DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, Doctor Gorga, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for, isn’t it? It’s my… friend’s son. He's been having… a problem. A discharge, you see. A rather unpleasant one. He asked me to come because… well, he’s a bit shy, and I’m the only one he trusts to… explain things properly.
DOCTOR: Right… a discharge. Okay. And this is… your friend’s son. How old is he, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. He's… not a boy anymore, certainly. Probably… mid-twenties? Perhaps twenty-six? Twenty-seven? He doesn’t share his age freely, you understand. A very private young man. It's not the sort of thing one asks, really. But somewhere in that range, I would wager. Though he looks younger, thankfully. A good-looking boy, really. It’s a shame about… all this.
DOCTOR: Mid-twenties… alright. And how long has he been experiencing this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a tricky one. He didn’t specify, exactly. Just… “a while.” I pressed him, of course, but he’s not one for details. Perhaps… a month? Maybe six weeks? It’s all rather vague. He’s a bit careless with his health, that boy. Doesn’t believe in doctors, generally. Only came to me because it was… becoming bothersome, he said. Honestly, men! They never take care of themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so. And can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s not… pleasant. It’s… yellowish, I think. Or perhaps greenish? It’s difficult to say, really. I didn’t examine it, Doctor. I merely… inquired. And he described it as… thick. And… smelly, naturally. One would expect it to be, wouldn’t one? It’s not a delicate fragrance, I assure you. He seemed quite distressed about it, though he wouldn’t say much beyond that. Honestly, it’s terribly awkward, discussing such things.
DOCTOR: Right, yellowish-greenish, thick, and…odorous. Any pain or burning associated with it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, he mentioned something about that. Not… constant, he said. More of a… stinging sensation. Especially, well, during. And afterwards, of course. He didn’t elaborate. He’s a very… reserved young man. I asked if it was painful, and he said, “uncomfortable.” Men! Always minimizing things. But he did say it made… things… difficult. And that’s why he finally agreed to come. It's all rather distressing, really. He's a good boy, and doesn’t deserve this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t believe he said anything about fever. He hasn’t been feeling particularly well generally, he admitted, but he attributed that to… stress at work. He's in… computers, you see. A terribly sedentary job. As for chills… no, I don’t recall him mentioning chills. And abdominal pain… no. He didn't complain of that, either. Though he does have a bit of a sensitive stomach, generally. He’s always complaining about indigestion. But I don’t think that's related to… this. He’s a bit of a hypochondriac, that boy. Always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Has he had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question. He didn't say. He’s not one for sharing his… history, you understand. I pressed him, of course, but he just mumbled something about it being “personal.” Honestly, men! Such secrets. He’s always been… discreet. I don’t believe he’s had a… relationship recently, either. Not that I know of, anyway. He keeps to himself mostly. He’s a bit of a loner, that boy. So, whether he’s had this before… I simply can’t say. It’s terribly frustrating, trying to get information out of him.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given what you’ve told me… it sounds like it could be a sexually transmitted infection, possibly gonorrhea or chlamydia. But we need to run some tests to confirm. I'll need to examine him. Do you think he'd be willing to come in for an appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A sexually transmitted infection? Well, that's… rather alarming. He didn’t mention anything about… that. Though, truthfully, he’s a bit evasive. I suppose it's possible. He’s a young man, after all. I certainly hope not, though. It would be terribly embarrassing for him. As for an examination… well, he’s not one for doctors, as I’ve mentioned. He'll likely be very reluctant. But… if you think it’s necessary, I can try to persuade him. Though I can’t promise anything. He’s quite stubborn, that boy. But I suppose for a proper diagnosis… he might agree. Yes, I can try. But please be… gentle, Doctor. He's a very sensitive young man. And discreet, of course. This must be kept entirely confidential.
DOCTOR: Of course, complete confidentiality. I understand. Alright, let's schedule an appointment for him. I'll explain everything as gently as possible. We’ll just need a urine sample and a quick examination. It's the only way to know for sure. Can you give me his name and date of birth?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. His name is… Javier Castillo. And his date of birth is… March 12th, 1998. Though he prefers people not make a fuss over birthdays, truthfully. He’s a rather private person, you see. And please, Doctor, do be gentle with him. He's a bit… shy. And I would greatly appreciate it if you could explain everything to me as well, afterwards. I worry about him, you see. He doesn’t have anyone else to… explain things properly. Just me. And I'm… not very good with medical terminology, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything to both of you in plain language. We’ll get this sorted out. Let’s get him scheduled for tomorrow morning, say 9:00 AM?
PATIENT: Oh, tomorrow morning… yes, that should work. He doesn’t have much going on these days. 9:00 AM is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. He’s a good boy, Javier is. A bit… lost, perhaps. But a good boy. And I'm sure he'll be very grateful for your help. I'll tell him to expect you. And I'll… try to prepare him for… everything. Though I can’t promise he won’t be nervous. He’s not one for medical procedures, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll do our best to make him comfortable. You tell him to take a deep breath, and we'll take it one step at a time. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. .
