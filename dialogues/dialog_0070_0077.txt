DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good morning to you too, doctor. They tell me I have to come. Company man say so. Something about… the dust. I been working in the mine a long time, you know. Never bothered me before. But they say I have to get checked. Don’t see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like your employer is requesting a check-up related to your work in the mine, specifically concerning dust exposure. That’s very responsible of them, actually. Even if you haven’t noticed any problems, it’s always best to be thorough. Could you tell me a little more about this dust?
PATIENT: Thorough? Hmph. They just don’t want trouble if something happens to one of us. That dust… it’s just dust, doctor. Coal dust mostly. Been breathing it in for… well, longer than you been alive, probably. It gets everywhere. Black dust. Makes everything black. You eat it, you drink it, you breathe it. What do you want to know about dust? It's dust!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. You're right, it is dust, and you've been exposed to it for a very long time. However, prolonged exposure to certain types of dust, even seemingly harmless ones, can sometimes lead to health issues. That’s why we’re doing this check-up. To get a better understanding, could you describe any symptoms you have experienced, even if you don't think they're related?
PATIENT: Symptoms? I told you, I don't have symptoms! I feel fine. Strong as a bull, I am! Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t at my age? I work hard, doctor. Hard work makes a man tired. Not dust. Don’t go trying to tell me dust is making me sick. It’s ridiculous. You think I haven’t breathed dust before? I practically live in it.
DOCTOR: I certainly wasn’t implying that the dust is necessarily making you sick, Mr. Bigger. I simply want to gather as much information as possible to ensure your well-being. It's good that you feel strong, that’s excellent. Just to be complete, let's go through a few quick questions. Have you noticed any coughing, perhaps with black phlegm?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. A little tickle in my throat. Everyone coughs, doctor. Especially in the winter. Black phlegm? I… I haven’t looked at it, if that’s what you’re asking. Why would I look at my phlegm? That's a silly question. I wipe my nose and get on with my day. Don’t waste my time with such things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a rather…unpleasant topic, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. We simply try to be thorough. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, perhaps when walking or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No! I walk to work every day! It's a good walk, up a bit of a hill. Never had trouble breathing. Used to climb all over things in the mine, too. Before they got all fancy with the machines. Never winded. I am a strong man. You keep asking me about things I don't have, doctor. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the repetitive questions, Mr. Bigger. I assure you, I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. It’s good to hear you’re so active. Now, let's move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any chest pain or tightness at all?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. Not a bit. I lift heavy things every day. Sometimes my muscles ache, but that’s just from the work. Not pain. You’re asking me about things that don’t happen, doctor. I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, I don't know why I'm here. The company is just making a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you're very healthy and active, which is wonderful. Now, just to be complete, have you experienced any weight loss recently, even if unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I eat plenty. My wife… my late wife, she always made sure I had enough to eat. And I still eat well. I like my food. Maybe I’m a little thinner than I used to be, but that’s just getting older. Old men lose weight, it’s natural. Don’t go making a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s completely normal to experience some weight changes as we age. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Never. I don’t take any pills. Never needed any pills. Strong constitution, you see. My father lived to be 90, and he never took a pill in his life. Just hard work and good food. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Always healthy.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Bigger. A strong family history of good health is certainly a blessing. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hospitalized? No! Never. Not a scratch on me, practically. Broke my arm once when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree, but my mother set it herself. Good woman, my mother. Knew all sorts of things. But no hospitals. I stay away from hospitals if I can. Full of germs, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to hospitals, Mr. Bigger. It’s good to hear you’ve remained healthy enough to avoid them. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Mangoes, peppers, fish… everything! Never had a problem. My wife, she was the one with allergies. Dust, mostly. Funny, that. But me? No. Strong stomach, you see. Can eat anything. Don't waste my time asking about allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I don't take any pills! None! Never have. Never will! I get everything I need from my food. Good food and hard work, that's all a man needs. You keep asking me the same questions, doctor. It's a waste of time. I think I'm done here.
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Bigger, just a few moments more. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for repeating questions. However, it’s important for me to have a complete medical history. Given your work history with coal dust exposure, even though you feel perfectly healthy, I would like to perform a brief physical exam—listening to your lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick examination of your heart. It’s a standard precaution and will help me ensure your well-being. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. And don’t go poking around too much. I don’t like doctors poking around. Just listen to my lungs, check the pressure, whatever. But be gentle. And quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out… Your breathing sounds… a little diminished, but not significantly. There are some faint crackles, particularly at the bases of your lungs. This can be common with long-term dust exposure. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated, but not critically high. Finally, I’ll just listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a strong murmur, but it warrants further investigation. Overall, Mr. Bigger, you seem generally healthy, but there are a few findings that concern me enough to recommend some additional testing. Would you agree?
PATIENT: Testing? What kind of testing? I told you, I’m fine! A little murmur? Crackles? Everyone gets a little crackly when they get old! I don’t want any tests. I don’t like tests. What are you going to do, poke around in my chest? No. I’m not having any of it. The company is just trying to waste money. I think I'm done here. You've wasted enough of my time. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please, sit down for just one moment. I understand your reluctance, but these tests aren’t about proving anything. They’re about gathering information to ensure your long-term health. The tests I recommend are a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a simple blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. These are standard procedures. Given your prolonged exposure to coal dust, it’s important to rule out any potential lung problems, such as pneumoconiosis, or a worsening of any heart condition. I would also like to discuss a referral to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, for a more in-depth evaluation. Would you be open to considering that?
PATIENT: Pneumo… what-now? A lung specialist? You’re trying to scare me, aren’t you? The company sent me here to get me worried so they don’t have to pay me if I get sick! I know how this works. No. Absolutely not. No X-rays, no blood tests, no fancy specialists. I am perfectly fine. I have been working in that mine for fifty years and I am still standing. I don’t need your tests. I'm going home. Leave me alone. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I have no intention of scaring you. My only goal is to ensure your well-being. However, given your prolonged exposure to coal dust, I strongly advise you to reconsider these tests. While you may feel fine now, early detection is crucial for managing any potential health issues. I am concerned about the faint crackles in your lungs and the murmur I detected in your heart. I will document your refusal of testing, but I must advise you that this is against my medical recommendation. I will also send a report to the company outlining my findings and your decision. Please, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or persistent cough, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is my card. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you change your mind. .
