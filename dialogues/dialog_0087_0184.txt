DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Trendler is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. I don't like what I see in the mirror, alright? Too much…sag. Everything’s droopin’. Need somethin’ done about it. Don’t need a long explanation, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your appearance – specifically, some sagging. To help me understand what might be going on, and to discuss potential options, I’m going to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. It will take a bit of time to properly assess the situation, but I assure you, I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, can you tell me when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Lady, I been seein’ changes for years! But…let me think. Properly think. Maybe…five years ago? Yeah, 'bout five years. Started with the neck, I reckon. Just a little wobble when I turn my head. Didn’t pay it much mind then, you know? Old age creepin’ in. Now it's...worse. Much worse. Don't need a history lesson though, alright? Just what can be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, five years ago, starting with a wobble in the neck. Thank you. Now, has this progressed to other areas?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course it has! You think it stopped at the neck? Look at my face! Everything’s slippin’. Jowls, chin…even my eyelids! It’s a whole mess, lady. A whole mess. I used to have a strong jawline, you know? Now it just…hangs. Don’t need you to point it out, I see it every mornin’. Is there a fix for all this or not? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’ve noticed changes throughout your face and neck. To get a clearer picture, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll need to gently assess the skin and underlying tissues in those areas. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? You wanna poke and prod at me? Alright, alright, get it over with. But be gentle, you hear? I ain't a piece of fruit you can squeeze. And don’t be wastin’ my time. Quick and efficient, that's what I want.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Please have a seat, and I'll begin the examination. Alright, Mr. Trendler, I’m examining your neck now. I’m noting some degree of skin laxity, which is common with age. I also observe some loss of muscle tone. Now, let’s move to your face. I’ll gently assess your jowls, chin, and eyelids. Okay, and finally, your eyelids… I do see some degree of ptosis, or drooping, of the upper eyelids. Do you experience any difficulty with your vision because of this?
PATIENT: Ptosis? Droopin'? No, I see fine. Always have. Just don’t like the way it looks. Makes me look tired, you know? Old. And I ain’t old! Well, not that old. Look, you keep touchin’ my face. I need to know what you can DO about all this saggin'. What options I got? Surgery? Injections? I don’t wanna end up lookin’ like one of them…Hollywood types, all stretched out. Just want to look…respectable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Based on my examination, you have noticeable skin laxity in your face and neck, as well as some mild ptosis of your upper eyelids. There are several options we could consider, and you’re right to be concerned about achieving a natural-looking result. Surgical options include a facelift and neck lift, which can provide a more significant and longer-lasting improvement. However, they do involve downtime and potential risks. Non-surgical options, such as injectable fillers and Botox, can also help to restore some volume and reduce the appearance of sagging, but the results are temporary and require ongoing maintenance. Given your concerns about a natural appearance, I think we should discuss both surgical and non-surgical options in more detail. To help me determine the best course of action for you, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ugh. Alright, alright. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my blood pressure’s a little high, but I take pills for it. Other than that, not much. I was a pile driver operator for…a long time. Hard work. That's about it. No allergies, don't smoke, barely drink. Now, stop askin' questions and tell me what you recommend! I haven’t got all day. And I don't wanna hear about risks. Just the good stuff. What can fix this face?
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, and a history of manual labor. No allergies, minimal smoking or alcohol consumption. Thank you. Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution. However, it’s important for me to be thorough and ensure you understand all the potential benefits and risks before making any decisions. Given your concerns about appearing natural and avoiding a significant surgical procedure, I would recommend starting with non-surgical options. Injectable fillers can restore volume to your cheeks and jowls, which can help to lift and contour your face. Botox can also help to relax the muscles in your forehead and around your eyes, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and sagging. These treatments are relatively quick and have minimal downtime. We can start with a small amount of filler and gradually increase it until you achieve the desired result. However, it's important to understand that these results are temporary, and you will need to repeat the treatments every 6-12 months to maintain them. Would you be interested in discussing this option further?
PATIENT: Fillers and…Botox? Sounds like somethin’ the wife used to do. Alright, alright, if it's quick and don’t leave me lookin’ like a balloon, I’ll listen. But I wanna see pictures. Pictures of real people. Not them fancy Hollywood faces. And tell me how much it's gonna cost. Don’t sugarcoat it. I need to know the bottom line, alright? Get to it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I completely understand. I have some before-and-after photos here of patients with similar concerns who have had excellent results with fillers and Botox. As you can see, the results are natural-looking and can significantly improve your overall appearance. Now, regarding the cost, a typical treatment plan would involve… approximately 2-3 syringes of filler for the cheeks and jowls, costing around $600-$900 per syringe. Botox would be an additional $200-$300, depending on the number of units needed. A consultation with a qualified aesthetician will give us a more precise estimate. Does that sound reasonable, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: $600…$900 a syringe? That’s a lot of money! And it ain't permanent? Seems like a waste. I gotta think about it. And I gotta talk to my daughter. She’s good with money. No, don't get me wrong, the pictures look alright. But a lot of money for somethin' temporary. I'll take your card, though. And maybe, just maybe, I'll give you a call. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand completely. Take your time and discuss it with your daughter. I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have. Don't hesitate to call if you’d like to schedule a consultation. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
