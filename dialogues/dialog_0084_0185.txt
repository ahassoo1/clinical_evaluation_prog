DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time, so… it's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband certainly made sure I knew that before he left. Is that something you can… fix?
DOCTOR: Okay, bad breath, or halitosis, is definitely something we can look into. It can be caused by a lot of different things, some simple, some a little more complex. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, “halitosis”? Seriously? Look, I work on the highway, okay? I don’t need fancy words. It just… stinks. And it's not like I've been eating garlic all day, although sometimes I do get a kebab on my lunch break. Does that matter? It’s just… consistently awful, and it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No, no fancy words, I apologize. And the kebab isn't a problem, just good to know. Okay, consistently awful... so it’s not just after certain foods or in the morning?
PATIENT: No, it’s pretty much… always. I mean, maybe a little better right after I brush, but it doesn't last. And honestly, I'm pretty good about brushing, you know? It's not like I just… don't bother. It's just… persistent. And I've tried those mouthwashes, the really strong ones, and they don't do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent despite good oral hygiene and use of mouthwash. That’s helpful to know. Zelina, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… am I sick? No, I feel fine. I mean, I'm tired, obviously, it's highway work, but that’s… normal. I don't have a cough, or a fever, or anything. Just… bad breath. Is it something serious? Because I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. It's unlikely to be something serious, but we want to rule things out. To get a clearer picture, let’s do a quick examination. I’ll just take a look in your mouth, feel your neck, and listen to your lungs, just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t like doctors poking around. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, it’s just my breath. It can't be that complicated. Can’t you just give me something to… mask it? Or stronger mouthwash? I have work to get back to, you know. People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and that you’re pressed for time, Zelina. While it might seem simple, bad breath can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues – things like sinus infections, acid reflux, or even early signs of gum disease. A quick exam helps us rule those out, so we can address the root cause, not just the symptom. It will only take a few minutes. If everything looks clear, then we can certainly talk about options for managing the smell. But I need to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And don't poke too hard. Honestly, I've had worse things happen on the highway, but still. Just… get it over with. And please, don’t tell me everything that could be wrong. I don’t need the stress.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. No scare tactics, I promise. Just a quick look. Could you open wide for me, please?
PATIENT: Just… hurry up. It feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay… your gums are a little inflamed, and there’s some mild redness around the back of your throat. Your lungs sound clear, and I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes. It doesn't appear to be anything major. It looks like the most likely cause is gingivitis – inflammation of the gums – and possibly some mild irritation at the back of your throat. Are you using floss regularly?
PATIENT: Floss? Honestly, no. I mean, I brush, but… floss? It seems like a lot of effort. And it hurts sometimes. Look, I'm out there directing traffic all day, dealing with grumpy drivers. I don’t have time for fiddling with tiny strings. Is that bad? Because I told you, I brush.
DOCTOR: Okay. Brushing is good, but it only cleans about 60% of the surfaces of your teeth. Floss gets in between where the brush can’t reach, removing food particles and plaque that cause inflammation. The inflammation is likely what's causing the bad breath, and that irritation at the back of your throat could be related, too. I recommend starting to floss daily. It might be a little uncomfortable at first, but it will get better. I can show you the proper technique if you'd like. Also, a saltwater rinse a couple of times a day can help reduce inflammation and freshen your breath. Would you be interested in learning how to floss correctly?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but honestly, I’m not really a “details” person. I just need something quick and easy. Saltwater rinse, okay, I can manage that. But floss? No. Is there a mouthwash that actually works? Like, a really strong one? And maybe… something to numb my gums if they hurt? Because I really don’t have time to deal with pain. I have a highway to run.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A strong mouthwash alone won’t solve the problem, but it can help manage the symptoms. I recommend a chlorhexidine mouthwash – it’s an antibacterial rinse that can reduce the bacteria causing the inflammation. It does have a strong taste and can sometimes stain your teeth, but it’s effective. We can discuss how to minimize staining. As for the gum pain, over-the-counter Orajel can provide temporary relief. But it’s just masking the problem, so I really do encourage you to consider incorporating floss into your routine. I'm going to write you a prescription for the mouthwash. Use it as directed, and try the saltwater rinse twice a day. If the pain is severe or doesn't improve after a week, please come back, and we can consider other options. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No other questions. Just… the prescription. And thank you. I guess. I really need to get back to work. Honestly, directing traffic is less stressful than this. Just… let me know when the prescription is ready.
DOCTOR: Here you go. The pharmacy is just down the street. Just let them know it’s from Dr. Voytek here at the clinic. I understand your concerns about time, Zelina. But please, if the problem persists, or if you notice any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to come back. Taking care of your oral health is important for your overall well-being. Have a safe day on the highway.
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. Thanks. .
