DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Orwin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Orwin. Werner Orwin. And frankly, I haven't got all day. What’s this about? I got a perfectly good afternoon planned, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have commitments. The purpose of this appointment, as I understand it, is to discuss what brought you in today. Perhaps you could start by telling me what’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Honestly, it's this face. It's...well, it's getting old. Sagging, wrinkling...it's not a pretty sight. I want something done about it. The doctor I spoke with said I needed some sort of check-up first. Seems like a waste of time, if you ask me. I’ve lived 81 years, what’s a few more wrinkles? But, alright, here I am. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily cosmetic concerns. And you’re experiencing…sagging and wrinkling. Any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Good heavens, no! I'm not ill, you know. It's just...unpleasant to look at. It's a matter of vanity, if you must know. Though I assure you, I wasn't always like this. I used to be quite a handsome man. A strong man, working with terrazzo all my life. This is just…the inevitable decline. Now, are we going to talk about fixing it, or are you going to ask me about every little ache and pain I've ever had?
DOCTOR: Very well. Just to be thorough, and because your primary care physician requested it…have you noticed any changes in sensation in your face?
PATIENT: Sensation? What kind of sensation? I feel my face, of course. It's...face-like. Look, I don't understand these questions. Do you mean like, tingling? No. Numbness? No. It feels…normal. Is this important? Are you trying to tell me something is wrong with me besides the obvious? Because if you are, you should just say so. I haven’t got time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any…weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness? In my face? Are you suggesting my face is weak? I can still smile, can’t I? See? Perfectly functional. I can eat, I can talk, I can… well, I can frown, apparently. This is ridiculous. I came here for a cosmetic consultation, not a neurological exam. Are you a surgeon or a…detective?
DOCTOR: We just need to rule out certain things before proceeding with any elective procedures. Have you had any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Not that I've noticed. I read the paper every morning, don't I? And I can see well enough to complain about the state of the world. It's not like I’m blind. I might need stronger reading glasses eventually, but that's just getting old, not some sudden, mysterious ailment. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. What’s next? Are we going to check my reflexes now?
DOCTOR: Right. And any history of stroke or transient ischemic attack – a TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke – in yourself or your family?
PATIENT: Stroke? Good Lord, no. I've never had a stroke! My father lived to be 92, strong as an ox, and my mother…well, she was a bit frail, but she didn't have a stroke either, as far as I know. The whole family was sturdy Norwegians. We don’t get strokes. This is getting absurd. Are you implying something about my health? Because frankly, I feel perfectly fine, aside from the wrinkles, of course. I need to get back to my garden. The tomatoes won’t pick themselves, you know. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. Well, before we discuss potential cosmetic interventions, I’d like to conduct a brief neurological exam. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. Just to be thorough. It shouldn't take long. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
