DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now and I thought I should get it checked out. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it’s…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. And you said you’ve noticed it for a little while now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Probably…oh, I’d say about a month or so. At first I thought it was just…something I ate, maybe? But it hasn’t gone away. It feels…firm, if that makes sense. Not hard as a rock, but definitely not soft.
DOCTOR: Firm, not soft… okay. And has it changed at all in size or shape over that month?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so. It’s hard to say for sure, honestly. I haven’t been actively measuring it or anything. It feels…about the same. Maybe a little bigger, but I could just be noticing it more now that I’m paying attention. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. It can be difficult to gauge changes without actively measuring. And you mentioned it doesn’t cause you any pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. That’s the main reason I waited a bit to come in. If it hurt, I would have come right away. It’s just…a worry, you know? It’s just there. Sometimes I feel a little…pressure, but it’s very mild, and it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Right, a worry is a perfectly good reason to come in. And mild, intermittent pressure… okay. Have you noticed any other changes along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. My bowel habits are normal, I haven’t had any fever or weight loss, and no bleeding or anything like that. I feel generally healthy, otherwise. It's just…this lump. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, normal bowel habits, no weight loss or bleeding… that’s all helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better feel for what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to press gently here. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Alright. It does feel firm, as you mentioned. About…2 centimeters in diameter, I’d estimate. It’s not deeply fixed to the underlying tissue, which is a good sign. No rebound tenderness, which is also reassuring. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything in the past. I take a daily multivitamin, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. That's good to know. And do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a child, that's about it. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. My family…my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some issues with his knees as he got older, but nothing major. I generally stay quite healthy. Oh, I did have a bout of food poisoning about five years ago, but I recovered quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, chickenpox as a child, family history of hypertension and knee issues… that’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I’m not much of a drinker, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol. That’s good. Now, Amy, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what this lump is without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a muscle knot, even a hernia. It doesn’t present with any alarming signs at the moment, but we do need to rule out anything serious. I'd like to order an ultrasound of your lower abdomen. That will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. An ultrasound sounds good. I’d like to know what’s going on, and if that’s the best way to find out, then I’m happy to do it. Where would I go for that, and do I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll send a referral to the imaging center at City General Hospital. They have excellent technicians there. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the appointment for you before you leave. You'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand. While we wait for the results, and just to be cautious, I'd like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That will give us a baseline, and help us rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very thorough, and I appreciate it. Fasting and blood work, I can definitely manage that. City General is close by, so that’s convenient. I suppose I just have one question…how long will it take to get the results back? And will you contact me directly when they're available?
DOCTOR: Okay, good questions. The ultrasound results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The blood work usually takes a similar amount of time. I’ll have the results sent directly to me, and I will contact you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. The receptionist will give you my direct line and the practice’s after-hours number, just in case. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – increased pain, redness, swelling, or any other symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. 24-48 hours for both tests, you’ll contact me directly, and I have your number. And I’ll call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we're getting this checked out. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. The receptionist will handle the scheduling and paperwork for the tests. She'll also give you a written summary of our conversation and the plan. I’ll also have her print out a work/school excuse form if you need one. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and attention. I’ll go speak with the receptionist now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and I'll speak to you when the results are in. .
