DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s just these hiccups. They’ve been going on for… well, a little while now, and they’re really starting to bother me, to be honest. Not dangerous, I don’t think, but tiring!
DOCTOR: Alright, hiccups that have been going on for a “little while.” Can you tell me approximately how long they’ve been persistent?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… persistent… hmm. It started maybe… three days ago? Yes, three days. Started after I had a particularly fizzy lemonade with my friend, Elsie. Elsie and I were reminiscing about the old days, you see, and we treated ourselves. But they haven't gone away like they usually do. Usually a good burp does the trick, but not this time.
DOCTOR: Three days, and it started after a fizzy lemonade. Okay. And are the hiccups constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, definitely. Not constant, thank goodness! But they’re… frequent. Like, several times an hour, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly, I’m not really keeping track, you know. They just… hic… pop up when I least expect them. It’s mostly when I’m relaxing, though. If I’m busy, I barely notice them. Which is a blessing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they're intermittent, happening several times an hour, and seem to be more noticeable when you're relaxed. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers them, besides the initial lemonade?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been trying to figure it out! I tried drinking water upside down, like my grandmother used to do. Didn’t work. I tried holding my breath… that just made me feel a bit dizzy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to wonder if I’ve upset the spirits or something! Old wives’ tale, of course, but a girl can wonder.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll try to rule out any medical causes before we consult the spirits. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, no, not really. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no trouble breathing. Just… hic… these pesky hiccups! Appetite is normal, I’m sleeping alright, energy levels are good for an old lady, you know? I'm still quite active, I do my gardening every morning. So, nothing else feels off, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other associated symptoms. Let's go over your medical history quickly. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see... Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years now? And I used to have high blood pressure, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time. Just a little pill every morning, nothing fancy. Apart from that, I'm pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself! I’ve always been a strong woman. I worked as a psychiatric aide for forty years, you know. Keeps you on your feet!
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and well-controlled hypertension. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I'll take a little bit of Ibuprofen, but not regularly. I try to avoid it when I can, doesn't agree with my stomach sometimes. But generally, just the Lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, I’m not a fussy eater at all! And I’ve never had any trouble with medications. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, working in the hospital, you see. So, no allergies to report, Doctor. Lucky me!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And before we move on, have you had any recent changes in your diet, or have you started any new supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. I've been eating pretty much the same for years. Elsie and I love our Fijian food, and I stick to that mostly. Fish, root vegetables, a little bit of coconut… nothing fancy. And definitely no new supplements or herbal remedies. I don’t really believe in those things, to be honest. A good diet and a little bit of sunshine, that’s what keeps me going! No, no changes to report there, Doctor. Just the fizzy lemonade, and that was three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. And one more. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are regular. Now, let me just feel your abdomen… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit sensitive if you press hard, but that's probably just old age, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be! But nothing painful, no specific spots that bother me. Just a bit of… firmness, maybe? But I wouldn't say it's tender. It feels… normal, for me, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, abdomen feels firm but non-tender. Given your history and the physical exam, it’s likely these hiccups are benign and self-limited. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something else. We can order some blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – just to rule out any underlying imbalances. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, if it puts my mind at ease, then definitely. Blood work is fine. I've had plenty of blood taken over the years, so I’m not afraid of a little needle! If it can rule out anything serious, then I’m happy to do it. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll get an order sent to the lab. You don't need to fast for these tests. Just drink plenty of water before you go. We’ll call you with the results in a few days. In the meantime, continue to try over-the-counter remedies, and if they worsen or you develop any other symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly clear, Doctor. No fasting, drink water, try over-the-counter stuff, and come back if anything changes. I’ll remember that. Thank you very much for your time and for listening to my silly hiccups! It’s good to know I’m not going crazy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It’s always best to investigate. We’ll get those tests ordered for you now. If you have any questions before you leave, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and hopefully, these hiccups will resolve on their own.
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Everything is clear. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day yourself!
