DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. I am here, if I understand correctly, to see if my situation qualifies for some assistance at home? My…ex-wife suggested I inquire about it. She thinks it might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Assistance at home, yes. To clarify, are you referring to assistance with daily living activities, or are you experiencing a specific medical concern that necessitates in-home care?
PATIENT: Ah. That is…a good question. It is both, I believe. Daily things are becoming…more difficult. And, well, my recovery from the operation has been slower than anticipated. It's been almost six months now, and I still tire easily. I do not wish to be a burden. Perhaps it is best to start with the daily things. It is…embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to ask for help, Mr. Bahta. Many patients find themselves in similar situations. We’re here to assess your needs and determine the best course of action. Let’s begin with the “daily things” as you put it. Could you elaborate on which daily activities you’re finding challenging?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is mostly…preparing meals. The standing for too long…it makes my leg ache. And the lifting of things…even moderate weight…it is not comfortable. Also, cleaning. The bending and reaching…it is becoming quite difficult. I manage, but it takes…much longer than before, and I am quite tired afterwards. I live alone now, you see, so there is no one to assist.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned an operation six months ago. Do you recall what that operation was for, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was a replacement of my left hip. A fall…quite a nasty one, actually. It happened last November. The doctors at Sainte-Marie Hospital performed the surgery. It went well initially, but the recovery has been…prolonged. They said sometimes this happens with…older bones. I am 54, you see. Perhaps not that old, but…not as young as I once was.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the record from Sainte-Marie. It does note a left hip replacement in November. And it does mention a potentially prolonged recovery. Now, aside from the difficulty with meals and cleaning, are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is pain. It is mostly in my hip, of course, but it radiates down my leg sometimes. It is not constant, but it is…noticeable. Especially after I have been walking for a while, or if I try to do too much. I take medication… prescribed by my family doctor, Dr. Dubois. It helps, but it does not eliminate it entirely. It is…a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you currently taking for the pain, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: It is…Tramadol, I believe. Two pills, twice a day. Doctor Dubois started me on a higher dose, but he reduced it last month because it made me…a little drowsy. He said we should try the lowest effective dose. It is…sufficient, mostly. Although, some days are more challenging than others. I do not want to complain. I am grateful for anything that offers relief.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the pain and difficulty with daily activities, have you noticed any other changes since the operation?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. Let me think… My appetite has been somewhat reduced, yes. I do not enjoy eating as much as I once did. And…my sleep is not as restful. I wake up several times during the night. It is not a major problem, but it does leave me feeling…tired. And I am a little more…forgetful, perhaps. But I have always been a little forgetful. It is probably just age. Do you require more details, Doctor? I have a rather…good memory, if I may say so. I remember dates and times quite well.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, we'll take all of that into consideration, Mr. Bahta. Now, let's move on to a brief review of your medical history. Have you had any other significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past, aside from the hip replacement?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, about forty years ago. And…I was diagnosed with high blood pressure several years ago. It is well-controlled with medication, though. I see Dr. Dubois regularly for check-ups. He monitors it closely. He says it is very important to keep it under control. I do as he says, of course. A very good doctor, Doctor Dubois. Very thorough. I have been with him for…almost twenty years, I believe. A good memory, you see? Perhaps that is why I remembered the date so precisely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication are you taking for your high blood pressure, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: It is…Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. I have not had any issues with it. Doctor Dubois says my blood pressure readings have been excellent since I started taking it. He is very pleased. I try to follow a healthy diet as well. Not too much salt, you see. He said that is very important for controlling my blood pressure. I avoid processed foods as much as possible. A healthy lifestyle, Doctor Dubois always says. It is the key.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Bahta, I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll need you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. It will allow me to assess your gait and range of motion. We’ll start with your left leg, of course. If you would please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I can do that. Although, if you do not mind, perhaps I could take a moment to sit down first? My leg sometimes feels a little…weak when I stand up suddenly. It would be best to avoid any…unnecessary strain. I do not wish to cause any inconvenience. And it is best to proceed cautiously, you see? I am 54, not as agile as I once was.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bahta. Please take your time. I will be right here. Once you are steady, if you could walk a few steps towards me, and then back, that would be helpful. Do not push yourself. We're simply observing.
PATIENT: It is… a little stiff this morning, Doctor. The weather, perhaps? It was quite damp yesterday. I must apologize for my slow pace. I do not wish to be a burden. Is this… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bahta, that’s sufficient. Please, have a seat. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your lower extremities. This will help me get a more comprehensive picture of your condition. It won't be uncomfortable, just a quick assessment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust your expertise. I will do as you say. Please, proceed at your own pace. I am in no particular rush. Although… if you do not mind, perhaps you could explain what you are doing as you go along? It helps to… ease my anxieties. I am not accustomed to medical examinations, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bahta. I am assessing your reflexes in your knees and ankles to check the integrity of your nervous system. It involves a gentle tap with this hammer. It will cause a slight jerk of your leg – perfectly normal. Then I’ll assess your muscle strength by asking you to resist my force as you attempt to move your legs in certain directions. Now, if you could extend your left leg, please. Just straight out, as much as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: It… it is a little stiff, Doctor. Perhaps I did not mention that before. The pain… it is more pronounced when I extend it fully. But I will do as you say. Is this… sufficient? Or would you like me to… attempt a greater extension? I do not wish to cause any inconvenience, Doctor. I simply want to… cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: The response is… limited, Mr. Bahta. Now, I’m going to ask you to try and resist as I push down on your leg. Don’t push back with all your strength, just a moderate resistance. Try to keep your leg straight. Ready?
PATIENT: I… I am trying, Doctor. It is… difficult. The pain… it is becoming more intense. But I will do as you ask. Is this… sufficient? Or would you like me to… try harder? I simply wish to… cooperate fully and… provide you with the information you require.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. That’s sufficient. Now, let’s move on to your right leg. We’ll repeat the same assessment on that side as well. Just so we have a baseline for comparison.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I will do as you say. Please, proceed at your own pace. I am… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: The reflex appears normal on this side. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I push down on your leg, just as we did before. Try to keep your leg straight. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe I can manage that quite well. Is this… sufficient? Or would you like me to increase my resistance? I am feeling… considerably stronger on this side, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s sufficient, Mr. Bahta. Based on my examination, it appears you have weakness in your left leg and diminished reflex response, as compared to your right. Given your history of hip replacement and reported difficulty with daily activities, it's likely related to post-operative recovery and potential nerve impingement. I recommend a referral to a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored rehabilitation program. We may also consider an MRI to rule out any structural issues or nerve damage. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… rather involved, Doctor. And a physical therapist… will that involve… painful exercises? I confess, I was hoping for a simpler solution. What… what is the likelihood that this is simply… a prolonged recovery? Is there a chance that things will improve on their own, with time and… rest? And… what is the cost of these… procedures? I have private insurance, but… it is best to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, while it’s possible to see some improvement with time and rest alone, your symptoms have persisted for six months, which is beyond the typical recovery period for a hip replacement. The MRI is necessary to rule out more serious underlying issues, such as nerve impingement or structural damage. It is a non-invasive procedure, though it does involve lying still for approximately 30-60 minutes. As for the cost, I’m unable to provide a precise estimate. You will need to contact your insurance provider to determine your coverage and out-of-pocket expenses. However, a physical therapy program typically involves several sessions over a period of weeks to months. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable physical therapy clinic, and they will be able to discuss the program details and associated costs with you. Do you wish for me to proceed with the referral?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, proceed with the referral. I suppose… it is best to be proactive. And… could you perhaps provide me with a summary of today's examination? Something I could take with me… to share with the physical therapist? It would… ease my anxieties to have something in writing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… guidance.
DOCTOR: Here is a summary of today’s findings. It includes documentation of your diminished left patellar reflex, weakness in left leg extension, and reported difficulty with daily activities. I have also included the referral information for a physical therapy clinic nearby. I advise you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and… expertise. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And… thank you again. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Next. .
