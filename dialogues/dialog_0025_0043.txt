DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band, you know? It’s been happening on and off for…oh, maybe a couple weeks now. Not the worst pain, but it’s there, and it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a headache, you say. A tight band sensation, located in the back of the head, for about two weeks. And it’s becoming more bothersome. Okay. Now, when you say "on and off," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t hurt all day, every day. Some days it’s fine, completely gone. Other days it’s just a little there, like a mild pressure. And then sometimes, like yesterday, it’s a bit stronger, makes it harder to concentrate. It seems to come and go with…well, I don't really know what. Doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, really. I try to drink water, that helps a little sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So intermittent, varying in intensity. No clear triggers that you've noticed. You've tried hydration with some relief occasionally. Do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm…let me think. I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse. Being tired maybe? When I don't get enough sleep, it feels a little more noticeable. And…maybe when I'm stressed. My daughter, she’s been having some trouble, and that’s been on my mind a lot lately. But it's not like the headache always comes when I'm worried, you know? Just…sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue and stress seem to be potential exacerbating factors, though not consistently. And your daughter’s situation is causing you some worry. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see... No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t thrown up, and my vision’s been okay. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, especially in the morning. But I figured that was just from sleeping wrong. It's not a sharp pain, just kinda…tight. Oh! And sometimes, when the headache is really bothering me, I feel a little bit…nauseous, but not like I'm going to get sick, just a bit queasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, no vomiting, vision is intact. Neck stiffness, particularly in the morning, and mild nausea with more severe headaches. Alright. Let’s get some more information. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it's under control now. Been taking medication for it for…oh, must be ten years or more. Other than that, not much. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that healed up just fine. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I used to get migraines when I was younger, but haven't had one in…a really long time. Decades, probably.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and a childhood wrist fracture. History of migraines, but not recently. Good. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see if I can remember the name… it’s a little white pill… ah, yes! Lisinopril. That’s it. 20 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And that’s pretty much it. Just the Lisinopril. Oh, and sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that’s not regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, and occasional Tylenol as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I eat everything, no food allergies either. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something by now!
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Now, family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had diabetes, I think, later in life. And my father… he had heart trouble. But a lot of people have heart trouble, you know? My siblings are mostly healthy, as far as I know. One sister has arthritis, but that's about it. It wasn't something we talked about much, to be honest. Just… everyday things, I guess. I don’t know of anyone with really bad headaches like migraines, or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of diabetes, paternal history of heart trouble. No significant family history of headaches. And finally, just a few social questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn’t like it. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, back in the day, but I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be twenty years or more. And no, no other substances. Just a simple life, Doctor. Mostly just trying to take care of my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Very good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological exam. It’s a pretty standard check-up, nothing to worry about. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem at all. Sit up? Sure, easy peasy. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Cranial nerves are grossly intact. There is some mild tenderness to palpation of the neck muscles, particularly in the occipital region. No nuchal rigidity is noted. Okay. Your neurological exam is normal. Your neck muscles are a bit tender, but nothing alarming. Given your symptoms and exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and elevated blood pressure. However, since your blood pressure is a little high today, and you’ve been having these headaches for a couple of weeks, I want to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I have been stressed lately, with my daughter. And I know my blood pressure isn’t always perfect, even with the medicine. What kind of things are you thinking about ruling out? And what do you recommend we do next? I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s just… unsettling, having this pain hanging over me all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you want to get to the bottom of this. To rule out other causes, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid problems. Also, since your blood pressure is elevated today, I'd like you to monitor it at home for a week, twice a day—morning and evening—and bring me the readings. I'll also order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, though based on your neurological exam, that's less likely. We need to rule out more serious possibilities, just to be safe. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to hydrate and trying some stress-reduction techniques—deep breathing exercises, gentle stretching, or whatever helps you relax. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the pain, but don’t take them excessively. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work, monitoring my blood pressure, and the MRI… it’s a lot, but if that’s what it takes to get this figured out, then I’m willing to do it. I used to do a little Tai Chi, maybe I should get back to that. It was good for relaxing. So, I just need to schedule the blood work and the MRI, and start writing down my blood pressure? And I can take Tylenol in the meantime if it gets bad? Is there anything else I should be watching out for? Like, if the pain changes or gets really bad, should I call?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Schedule the blood work and start monitoring your blood pressure. And you can take Tylenol as needed for pain relief. I’ll give you a prescription for the blood work. The MRI can be scheduled through the radiology department—I’ll have the nurse give you the information. Now, listen carefully. If you experience any of the following, seek immediate medical attention: severe headache that comes on suddenly, headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, changes in vision, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or seizures. These could indicate a more serious problem. Even if the pain just feels significantly different, or much worse than usual, don’t hesitate to call. It’s always better to be safe. We’ll review the results of the blood work and MRI when they come back, and we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vision changes… I’ll remember those. And I'll get the blood work scheduled and start writing down my blood pressure. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting this checked out. I really appreciate your time and patience. It’s nice to have someone listen and take it seriously.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Gibbel. That’s what I'm here for. The nurse will get you checked out and give you the necessary paperwork. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself.
