DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me – in as concise a manner as possible, if you don’t mind – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Concise, you say? Fine. I'm here for this... exam. For the army. Gotta get this done, you know. It's a requirement. Don't waste my time with fluff.
DOCTOR: An army physical, of course. Very well. Let's attempt to be efficient, then. Now, have you had a recent physical examination before this one, perhaps by another physician?
PATIENT: Another physician? No. Why would I bother paying someone else to tell me what I already know? I keep myself in good shape. I work with engines all day, it’s physical work. Not like sitting around doing nothing. What kind of question is that?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Hartness, to establish a baseline. However, if you insist. Very well. Tell me, are you currently experiencing any discomfort, pain, or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms? Look, I'm a mechanic. My hands are always dirty, I get aches, I'm tired sometimes. That’s normal. Nothing… unusual. Don't you have other patients? This is a waste of time. Is there a form I can just fill out?
DOCTOR: A form would not suffice, Mr. Hartness. The army requires a physician's assessment. Now, if you'll permit me to conduct a brief examination, we can proceed. Let's start with your weight and height. I see here you are listed as 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms… is that accurate?
PATIENT: Accurate? Yes, perfectly accurate. I haven't grown or shrunk since last week, I assure you. 187, and 53. Don’t question it. It’s what the scale says. I eat sensible. Mostly. What's this about, exactly? Is something wrong with the numbers? Are you implying something?
DOCTOR: I am merely verifying the information, Mr. Hartness. It's… a rather low weight for your height, that is all. Regardless. Let's move on. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. I need to eat to keep going, you know? Working hard burns calories. Dust, maybe. From the workshop. But that's not an allergy, that's common sense. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Just tell me if I pass or fail. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: It's not quite so simple, Mr. Hartness. I must assess your overall health. Now, have you had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Surgeries? Look, I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, whatever. Nothing serious. Never been hospitalized. A few broken fingers fixing engines, but I just taped them up and got back to work. No doctor needed for that. Waste of time and money, all of it. Are we getting anywhere? This is a pre-exam, not a life story session.
DOCTOR: Very well. Family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? My father worked until he was 70, strong as an ox. Mother lived to be 85, always busy. Bit of arthritis, maybe, in the end. That's it. Good genes, I suppose. We're a practical family, not one for complaining or sitting around at the doctor’s office. Look, I really don’t see the point of this. It's just a physical. Pass me, and let's be done. I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, I am attempting to gather the necessary information to ensure you are fit for service. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Are you accusing me of something? I drink a beer with dinner sometimes, on a Saturday. And maybe a small glass of snaps at Christmas. Smoking? No. Never. I need a clear head for my work. It requires concentration. This is getting insulting. I'm a responsible man. A hard worker. Just check the boxes and let me know if I'm good enough. This whole thing is a waste of perfectly good time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I believe I have sufficient information. Please step onto the scale, and then we can proceed with a brief physical examination. However, I must advise you that your current weight is significantly below the expected range for your height, and further investigation may be required. Do not interrupt. This is for your own safety.
