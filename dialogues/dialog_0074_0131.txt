DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Reisig! Nice to meet you too. Well, I been havin' some trouble with my blood pressure. It's been a bit high, that's why I made an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sladen, thank you for letting me know. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. To get a better understanding of what's been going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it was high?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I think it was... around March, maybe April of this year. I usually get it checked at the pharmacy when I pick up my prescriptions, and that's when they first told me it was a little elevated. It hasn't gone down on its own since then, so I figured I should get it looked at properly.
DOCTOR: That's good you were proactive about getting it checked and then following up with an appointment. And thank you for giving me that timeline. Has anyone started you on any medication for your blood pressure since the pharmacy visit?
PATIENT: No, nothin' at all. They just told me to watch my salt intake and try to reduce stress, but... well, easier said than done, right? That's why I wanted to come see you, to see what else I could do. I haven't changed much with my diet, to be honest, and the stress... it's just part of life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sladen. Lifestyle changes are often the first step, but they aren’t always enough, and managing stress can be very difficult. We can certainly explore other options. Could you describe what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A typical day... Well, I work part-time at a senior center, helpin' with activities and stuff. It's mostly mornings. After that, I usually run errands, cook, and... well, try to relax. I don't have family close by, so it's mostly just me. Evenings are pretty quiet. I like to watch a little TV, read, and try to get to bed early. It's not too exciting, but it's my life! Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sladen. Thank you for sharing that with me. Knowing your daily routine helps me understand your lifestyle better. Now, when you say “stress,” could you tell me what specifically is causing you stress?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? It's mostly... bein' alone, I guess. Not havin' anyone to really lean on. And worryin' about money, to be honest. My hours at the center aren’t always steady, and things are expensive these days. And just... general worryin' about gettin' older, you know? Things startin' to ache and creak and... well, it adds up. I try not to dwell on it, but it's always there in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those are all very valid sources of stress, Ms. Sladen. It’s important to acknowledge them. Let's move on to some other health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. I had my gallbladder out a few years back, but that’s it. And I have a little arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. Mostly just a bit stiff in the mornings. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat reasonably well, and I go for a walk when the weather's nice. I wouldn't say I’m a fitness fanatic, but I don’t sit around all day!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Sladen. And thank you for letting me know about the gallbladder removal and arthritis. Knowing your medical history is very helpful. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my hands when they're achin' really bad. That’s it. I try to avoid takin' too many pills, if I can help it. I don't like feelin' like I'm dependin' on somethin' to get through the day, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sladen. It’s good to be mindful of what you’re putting into your body. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' at all. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I'm lucky that way, I suppose. My mother was always very careful about what she fed us, so maybe that helped.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to know, Ms. Sladen. No known allergies is very helpful. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother had high blood pressure too, actually. She was on medication for it for years. And my father had heart problems later in life, needed a stent, I think it was. My sister's healthy as a horse, though, thankfully! So, it seems like it runs in the family a little bit, on my parents' side. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Sladen. Knowing your family history of hypertension and heart problems is important. Okay, Ms. Sladen, it looks like your last blood pressure reading at the pharmacy was 148/92. That is indeed elevated. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your pulse and blood pressure again to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Dr. Reisig. Whatever you need to do. I'm just hopin' we can figure somethin' out to get it under control. I don't want to end up like my mother, havin' to take pills for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Sladen. We will work together to find the best approach for you. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. And now, your blood pressure reading is 150/90. Still elevated. Thyroid feels normal. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little bit at the end of the day sometimes, but nothin' major. I usually put my feet up when I get home, and that helps. I haven't noticed anythin' too concerning, honestly. I've been lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sladen, that’s good to know. No significant swelling is helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, your blood pressure is consistently elevated, which is concerning given your family history. We need to investigate this further to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Dr. Reisig. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work and an EKG... alright. Just let me know where to go and what I need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? I don't want it gettin' worse.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sladen. We’ll get this sorted out. Here are the requisitions for your blood work and EKG. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. The EKG machine is in the same room; the technician will be happy to assist you. They are usually quite efficient. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor, and focusing on stress reduction techniques as much as possible. Are you able to check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't have one, Dr. Reisig. I thought about gettin' one, but I wasn't sure which one to buy. Maybe I should look into that? I'm not very tech-savvy, so I'd need somethin' pretty simple. And I'll definitely try to reduce stress. Easier said than done, but I'll work on it! What kind of stress reduction things do you recommend?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sladen, we can discuss home blood pressure monitoring options at your follow-up. As for stress reduction, there are many things you can try. Gentle exercise like walking, deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even spending time doing hobbies you enjoy can be very helpful. Some people find yoga or tai chi beneficial as well. And don't underestimate the importance of social connection – spending time with friends and family can make a big difference. I also have some brochures here with information about stress management techniques and resources in the community. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on and can develop a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me before you go get these tests done?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Dr. Reisig. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me and not rushin' through things. I feel a bit better just havin' a plan now. I'll go get these tests done, and I'll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sladen. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
