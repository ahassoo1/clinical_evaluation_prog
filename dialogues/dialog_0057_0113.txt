DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto, yes, that’s me. Well, it's this… this business with the waterworks, you know? Going too often. It's a nuisance, really. A man’s got things to do, can’t be running to the… well, you understand. It's been going on… oh, goodness, a while now. Can’t rightly put a date to it.
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. You said it's been going on for a while… can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmph. That’s a difficult one. Maybe… a few months? Or was it longer? Time… it slips away, doesn't it? I wouldn’t want to mislead you, Doctor. It’s not sudden, like. It just… gradually got worse. I used to be able to hold it… now, not so much. It’s just… inconvenient, is what it is.
DOCTOR: That's alright, an estimate is perfectly fine. It sounds like it developed slowly, which is helpful to know. Besides the frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Well, my wife, bless her soul, says I’m up more at night. Potty breaks, you know? And… now that you mention it, sometimes it feels like I don’t… empty everything, if you catch my drift. Like there’s still a little left in there. It’s… unpleasant. Not painful, mind you, just… not complete. And I seem to be drinking more water, too. Though that might just be the heat. It's been a scorcher this summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, especially at night, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and increased thirst. That’s all very helpful information, Mr. Segretto. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not a bit. Burning either, for that matter. Just… the constant bother of it. It’s more… a nuisance than anything. Like a leaky faucet, always dripping. Drives a man mad, it does. Though, to be honest, I'm not as spry as I used to be. Could just be old age catching up with me. Everything starts to go a bit wobbly, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to rule out pain and burning. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmph. That’s a question. I've lived a good long life, Doctor, seen my share of bumps and bruises. Had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. As for later in life… I had my prostate checked a few years back. The doctor said it was a little enlarged, but nothing to worry about at the time. Can’t recall the doctor's name now, though. It was at the old hospital, before they built this fancy place. And my wife keeps telling me my blood pressure’s been a bit high, but I don’t pay much attention to those things. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of an enlarged prostate and your wife has noted some high blood pressure readings. Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with diabetes or had any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Not that I recall. My wife always cooked healthy, you know? Lots of beets and potatoes, good solid farm food. And kidneys… now, that’s a question. I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with those. I drink plenty of water, like I said. Helps keep everything… flowing, you know? Though, sometimes I wonder if all that water is causing the problem! It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: It certainly can feel that way. Alright, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I take a little something for my arthritis, helps with the stiffness in my hands. It's a white pill, small one. Can't recall the name. My wife handles all that, you see. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those… what are they called… a sleep aid. Something with ‘PM’ in the name, I think. Besides that, nothing. I don’t believe in loading up on pills, if I can avoid it. Natural remedies are best, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, an arthritis medication and a sleep aid containing ‘PM’. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmph. Not that I know of. Never been one for sniffles or rashes. Though, my skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, especially in the winter. But that’s just the dry air, I reckon. Nothing serious. My wife tried some cream for it once, but it didn’t seem to help much. We just put up with it. I’m a pretty sturdy fella, never been bothered by much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also want to do a brief abdominal exam and a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It's standard procedure given your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a what now? A digital… what was it? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to check things, but… I'm an old man. I’ve lived a good long life. Do we really need to poke around in… well, you know? I trust your judgment, of course, but it sounds… uncomfortable. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Segretto. You're right to ask. A digital rectal exam allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate, which can help determine if the enlargement is contributing to your urinary symptoms. It's a quick exam, and while it can be a little uncomfortable, it provides valuable information. It’s not my intention to cause you any distress. Given your history and symptoms, it would be the most responsible course of action to rule out any concerning issues. However, we can certainly discuss alternatives, though they may require additional testing like a PSA blood test and possibly a referral to a urologist for imaging. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A PSA… imaging… It’s all getting a bit complicated, isn’t it? Look, Doctor, I'm not one for tests and poking and prodding. I’d rather not go down that road if I can avoid it. Is this enlargement something I need to worry about? Is it dangerous? If it’s just a bit of getting older, maybe we can just… monitor it? I can try drinking less water, see if that helps. And I can try to be more patient when I need to… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Segretto, and I respect your wishes. It's important to me that you feel comfortable with the plan. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age and doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, it can cause bothersome symptoms like the ones you're experiencing. While monitoring your symptoms and trying lifestyle changes like reducing water intake is a reasonable first step, it’s important to be aware of potential complications like urinary retention or infections. Given your age and the fact that you haven't had a recent prostate exam, I still recommend a PSA blood test as a minimally invasive way to get a baseline reading. This will give us a better understanding of your prostate health and help us decide if further investigation is needed. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A blood test… hmm. That doesn’t sound so bad, I suppose. A little prick of the needle, and that’s it? Not like poking around… down there. Yes, all right, Doctor. A blood test sounds acceptable. As long as we don’t go any further than that right now. And if it comes back… normal, or whatever, can we just leave it at that?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Segretto. A blood test it is. And if the results are normal, we can certainly monitor your symptoms and see how you respond to lifestyle changes. We can revisit further testing if your symptoms worsen or if the results suggest it’s necessary. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood for you now. She’ll also provide you with a requisition form and instructions on how to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, please try to reduce your water intake slightly and let me know if you experience any fever, chills, or difficulty urinating. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Reduce the water, watch for… unpleasantness. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… patient with an old man. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It's my pleasure. Taking care of my patients is what I do. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
