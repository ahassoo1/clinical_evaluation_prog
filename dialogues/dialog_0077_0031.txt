DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to make the best use of our time, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been bothering me, and I… I have a heart problem, you see. They told me it was something about the beating, not being regular. It’s been happening for a bit now, but the leg is new.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the left leg, and a history of… irregular heartbeat, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Irregular. They said… atrial… something. It’s a tricky word. I don’t remember all of it, and I didn’t really ask much at the time, if I'm honest. It just meant taking pills, mostly. And now this leg. It’s quite painful when I walk, too.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! That's the word. Atrial… fibrillation. Is that bad? I mean, is this leg swelling because of that? I’m not sure I understand how it all connects, if you don’t mind me asking.
DOCTOR: It can be connected, yes. Atrial fibrillation can sometimes lead to blood clots, and those clots can travel to the leg and cause swelling and pain. We need to determine if that’s what’s happening here. First, let’s talk about the leg itself. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started about a week ago, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It was just a bit bigger than usual after I walked the dog, and then it didn’t really go down. I thought it was just from the walk, but it’s gotten worse each day. It’s definitely bigger now. I haven’t noticed any… redness, or anything like that, just swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. No redness, swelling progressively worsening over a week… Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any fever along with this swelling?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I haven’t been short of breath, not that I’ve noticed. No fever either. I feel a bit tired, generally, but that’s just… me, I think. I do get tired easily. But no, nothing with the leg, specifically. Just the swelling and the pain when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to examine your leg, and I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, please. Now, let’s start with your leg. I'm going to feel around to check for tenderness and warmth. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit there… around the calf. Not awful, but I can feel it. And… yes, a bit higher up, behind the knee. It’s a dull ache, really. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some tenderness and… yes, some pitting edema present. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and another one... Your heart rate is a little irregular, as expected, and I can hear some slight crackling in your lungs, but it’s not significant at this time.
PATIENT: Oh… crackling in the lungs? Is that… bad? I haven’t been coughing or anything. I just get a bit breathless sometimes when I walk up hills. Is that connected to the heart, or the leg? It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: It could be related to both, Nixon. The crackling suggests some fluid buildup in the lungs, which can happen with heart failure, and that irregular heartbeat isn’t helping. As for the leg, given the swelling, tenderness, and your history of atrial fibrillation, we need to rule out a deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in the leg. To be safe, I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test and a venous ultrasound of your left leg. The D-dimer will help us determine if there’s a blood clot, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins in your leg to confirm or deny the presence of one. Would you be able to get to a lab today?
PATIENT: A blood test and… a scan? Yes, I think so. I can get to the lab, if you tell me where to go. But… what if it is a blood clot? Is that… serious? And what about the heart? Is it getting worse? I’m sorry, I’m just a bit frightened now.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be frightened, Nixon. And it’s good to ask questions. A blood clot can be serious, yes, as it can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism, which is a medical emergency. However, we don't know that's what it is yet, and that's why we’re doing the tests. As for your heart, we will need to consult with a cardiologist to get a better assessment and manage your atrial fibrillation. I’m going to prescribe a low-dose aspirin for now. It can help prevent further clot formation. And I will also write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a cardiologist, and a lab requisition for the D-dimer and ultrasound. The lab is at 14 Oak Street. They accept walk-ins. Please go there as soon as you can and call me with the results. If you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or worsening leg pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Oak Street, a blood test, and call you with the results. And emergency room if it gets worse. Aspirin, too. Thank you, Doctor. That… that’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it. I’ll go to the lab right away. Should I… stop taking my usual pills until I speak to the cardiologist?
DOCTOR: No, do not stop taking your usual medications without consulting with Dr. Sharma first. Continue taking them as prescribed until you have spoken with her. She will advise you on any necessary adjustments. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m still a bit worried, but I feel better knowing what’s happening, and what I need to do. Thank you very much for your help. I will go to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Nixon. .
