DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Piet. Uh, well, it's about… not sleeping so good, I guess. And feeling a bit… off. Not strong, you know? My wife, bless her, she always said I needed to look after myself better. It's been a while since… well, never mind. Just feeling a bit tired and not as… put together as I should be.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Not sleeping so good” and feeling “off” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about the sleep, you want? Honestly, it’s just… patchy. I wake up a lot. Not every hour, but enough to feel it the next day. And I don’t really feel rested when I do wake up, even if I've been in bed for a good eight hours. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to sleep through anything. Now it's like a feather could wake me.
DOCTOR: Alright, patchy sleep and not feeling rested even after a full night. And it’s a recent change, you said?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. It's hard to say exactly when it started, you know? Things… blur a bit. Probably the last six months, maybe? Definitely got worse after… well, after things. It’s just… not the same. I used to have a routine, a proper one. Now I just… go to bed when I’m tired, I suppose. Not very scientific, is it?
DOCTOR: No, not very scientific at all. And you mentioned “after things” – is that something you’d be comfortable sharing, or is that too personal at this point?
PATIENT: It’s… my wife passed away, about a year ago. Sudden thing. Changed everything, naturally. Not that I expect that’s what’s causing the sleep, exactly. But it's… hard to separate things, isn't it? It's just… a lot. Don't know if that makes sense. I’m not a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Redfern. Grief can absolutely disrupt sleep and overall health. It's very common. Let's not dismiss that at all. So, besides the sleep disturbance, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. I get a bit… winded, I suppose. Used to be able to walk anywhere, climb stairs, no problem. Now I find myself… pausing. Catching my breath. Nothing major, but noticeable. And I've been… less interested in things, I guess. The instruments… I haven’t touched them properly in weeks. It’s unlike me. Just not… motivated, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion and a loss of interest in your hobbies. Have you had any chest pain, swelling in your ankles, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Ankles seem alright, I haven't noticed anything. And no fever or chills, thankfully. Just… tired. Always tired. It's like a dull ache, everywhere, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… worn out. It's probably just age catching up, I suppose. I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… just some blood pressure pills, the doctor gave them to me a few years back. Can't remember the name, honestly. And allergies… not that I'm aware of. Never really been one for allergies. Dust maybe, but who isn't a bit bothered by dust? Is that important? I’m terrible with names and details, you see.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Redfern. We can look up your blood pressure medication in the system. Okay, I see you're on Lisinopril. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… right. My father had… something with his heart, I think. Died when I was young. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had arthritis, bad arthritis. And my sister… she's still alive, thankfully, but she has diabetes. That's about all I remember, honestly. We weren't a family for sharing medical details, you see. More of a… keep-to-yourself kind of family. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Redfern. It gives me a starting point. We'll see if we can dig up more details later if necessary. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a repairer, Dr. Piet, not a… well, you get the idea. I need a steady hand for my work, you see. Can't be doing that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Redfern. Okay, so we have patchy sleep, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of interest in hobbies, family history of heart disease and diabetes, and you're on Lisinopril. I'd like to do a brief physical exam now, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Listening and checking… sounds sensible. Get it done, I suppose. Just… don't take too long, alright? I have things to do. Instruments to… look at. Not that I've been doing much of that lately. Still. Best to get this over with, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, Mr. Redfern. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Your heart sounds a little… muffled, and I hear some slight crackling in your lungs. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate. Now, your blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, especially since you're on Lisinopril. And your pulse is 88, which is normal. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Okay. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. This will help us rule out any underlying infection, check your kidney function, and see if there's anything going on in your lungs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A complete… what now? And an X-ray? Seems a bit… excessive, doesn’t it? I just came in because I’m tired. It’s probably just stress. A bit of a break is all I need, really. I don’t like the sound of all these tests. Are they… expensive? My wife… well, things are tight, you understand. I’m not sure I can afford all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Redfern. It’s true, those tests can be costly. However, given your symptoms and family history, it's important to rule out any serious underlying causes. Fatigue can be caused by many things, and it’s always best to be thorough. The tests will help us determine the cause of your fatigue, so we can treat it appropriately. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of the tests. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. I can have the billing department contact you directly to go over the estimated costs and your coverage. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests?
PATIENT: Medicare, you say? That’s… something, I suppose. Better than nothing. Alright, alright, go ahead then. Order the… whatever they are. The blood count, the panel, the X-ray. But please, make it quick. I don't like being poked and prodded any more than necessary. And get the billing people to call me, alright? I need to know how much this is going to cost. This is all very… disruptive. I had instruments to fix, you know. Important instruments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. I've ordered the complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and chest X-ray. The lab will contact you directly to schedule an appointment for the blood work, and the radiology department will schedule the X-ray. It's usually fairly quick to get those scheduled. I’ll also have the billing department contact you to discuss the costs and your coverage. In the meantime, I'd recommend getting some extra rest and staying hydrated. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results back. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with. Get the tests done, get the results, and tell me what I need to do. I suppose that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I really must be going. Instruments are waiting. Well, they would be, if I had any energy to fix them. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. You take care of yourself. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms.
