DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it’ll do wonders. I’ve never… well, it just doesn’t seem proper, but I suppose I’m willing to consider it if it’s truly helpful. I need a certification, she explained. Is that what you provide here?
DOCTOR: A certification, you say. While I am a physician specializing in internal medicine, I must admit that prescribing medical marijuana isn't typically within my standard practice. However, I understand your daughter’s suggestion, and I suppose we can discuss whether it might be appropriate for you, specifically. Before we proceed, though, let’s clarify a few things. You mentioned arthritis. Could you tell me more about which joints are affected?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Which joints… well, practically all of them, really. But the worst is my hands, definitely. Makes it awfully difficult to do… anything, frankly. And my knees. Walking is becoming quite the ordeal. It’s not like it happened overnight, you understand. Years of… well, years. My husband, he says I just need to slow down, but a lady has things to do. Is this what you need to know? All the joints, aching constantly? It’s a dreadful nuisance.
DOCTOR: Years of progressive joint pain... I see. “Constant aching” is rather vague, Ms. Ranells. Could you describe the pain a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically…? Oh, dear. Well, it's not a sharp pain, not usually. More like a… a dull throb. A heavy ache. And it gets worse with the weather, naturally. Damp days are the absolute worst. And cold. Cold is simply unbearable. Sometimes it’s just stiff, so stiff I can barely move my fingers. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. Is that specific enough for you, Doctor? I’m not a doctor myself, you know. It’s just… achey. A lot of achey.
DOCTOR: "Dull throb," "heavy ache," worse with damp and cold weather, and stiffness… Yes, that’s slightly more helpful. Now, Ms. Ranells, have you ever been formally diagnosed with a specific type of arthritis – rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, perhaps something else?
PATIENT: Oh, I've seen doctors over the years, certainly. They poked and prodded, asked a lot of questions… I recall one mentioning something about “wear and tear,” but frankly, they all just told me to take ibuprofen and get more rest. I never bothered to ask for specifics. Honestly, I just wanted something to make it stop. A proper diagnosis? No, I don’t believe so. I just assumed it was… old age. Is a diagnosis necessary for this marijuana… certification? It sounds awfully complicated.
DOCTOR: A proper diagnosis is always necessary, Ms. Ranells, regardless of potential treatments. We need to understand what we're treating before considering anything. Simply saying "wear and tear" isn't sufficient. Let’s perform a brief physical exam. I'll need to assess your range of motion, check for swelling and tenderness, and observe how your joints move. That will give us a better starting point. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. Though I must say, I don’t like being poked and prodded unnecessarily. I've never been one for… displays. But if it’s absolutely necessary… I suppose you must do what you must. Just be gentle, Doctor. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. And please, no cold instruments. That’s always terribly unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be as gentle as possible. And no cold instruments, I assure you. Please sit back on the examination table. Let's start with your hands. Could you extend your arms, palms up, please?
PATIENT: There we are. Oh, my. This is rather… undignified, isn’t it? I haven’t been on one of these things in years. And don’t pull too hard, Doctor. I don't want anything… out of place. My daughter would have a fit.
DOCTOR: I’m simply assessing your range of motion, Ms. Ranells. I observe some mild crepitus in the metacarpophalangeal joints… and slight tenderness upon palpation. Range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly with flexion. Now, let's check your knees. Could you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not very comfortable, Doctor. It feels rather… stiff, you know? And there’s a clicking sound. Always has been, actually. My mother had the same clicking knees. She said it was a sign of good breeding. Is that good breeding, or a sign of something dreadful? It’s rather difficult to tell these days. And please, no sudden movements. I don’t want to hear any popping sounds. That's never a good sign.
DOCTOR: Minimal swelling noted, but tenderness upon palpation of the medial joint line bilaterally. The clicking sound is likely crepitus, consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, have you had any other symptoms – any fever, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in other joints besides your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Fever? No, nothing like that. I've always had a good constitution, thankfully. Fatigue, well, I get tired easily, of course. I'm 74 years old, Doctor. One does get tired. And weight loss? No, if anything, I've gained a few pounds. My husband keeps telling me I need to watch my figure, but honestly, at my age, what's the point? Pain… well, just my hands and knees, mostly. Sometimes my back aches a bit, but that's probably from bending over to pick up things. It's all just… old age, really. Is all this necessary for the marijuana… paperwork? It’s rather tedious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Ranells, to rule out other potential causes. While your symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis, we cannot simply assume. Have you ever had any blood work done recently?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, goodness no. Not recently, and honestly, not ever, unless it was absolutely necessary. I don't care much for doctors poking around in my veins. I always feel faint. And frankly, what would blood work even tell you? I already know I ache. Is this some sort of test to see if I'm worthy of this… medication? It feels awfully invasive, Doctor. And a bit judgmental, if I may be so bold.
DOCTOR: It is not about “worthiness”, Ms. Ranells. It’s about ensuring you receive appropriate care and ruling out other possible conditions that could mimic osteoarthritis. However, given your reluctance and the lack of any red flag symptoms, we can proceed without blood work. Given your history and examination findings, it appears you likely have osteoarthritis. However, it is important to understand that medical marijuana is not a cure-all, and its effectiveness varies significantly. It also has potential side effects, which we should discuss. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… something, I suppose. I knew it wasn't a miracle cure. My daughter just says it takes the edge off. She's always reading those articles online. Side effects? Oh, dear. What sort of side effects? I don't want to be… giddy, or forgetful, or anything like that. My husband would never forgive me. And frankly, I don't want to spend all day napping. I have things to do. Are these side effects common? And are they… serious? You’re not trying to frighten me, are you, Doctor? I simply want a little relief for my aching joints. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ranells, I am not trying to frighten you. Potential side effects can include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, changes in appetite, and, in some cases, cognitive impairment. The severity varies greatly depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity. Given your age and the potential for drug interactions, I recommend starting with a very low dose, under strict medical supervision. Furthermore, I strongly advise against driving or operating heavy machinery while using medical marijuana. However, before proceeding, I must emphasize that I do not routinely prescribe medical marijuana. While I can provide a referral to a physician who specializes in this area, I believe it is important for you to have a thorough discussion with them regarding the risks and benefits, and whether it is truly appropriate for your specific condition. Would you like me to provide that referral?
PATIENT: A referral…? Oh, dear. That sounds awfully complicated. Another doctor to see, another poking and prodding… Honestly, Doctor, I came to you because my daughter said you might be able to help. I don't want to spend all my time running from one doctor to another. I simply want a little relief for my aching joints, and I thought this… marijuana might be the answer. But if you won't prescribe it… well, I suppose a referral is better than nothing. But I must warn you, I'm not very patient. And I expect this other doctor to be… understanding. And efficient. I don't have time for endless discussions. Just a prescription, if it's appropriate. Is that too much to ask? And can you recommend someone… reputable? I don’t want to end up with just anyone.
DOCTOR: Very well. I can provide you with a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She specializes in pain management and has experience with medical marijuana. Her office is located in the Meadowbrook Medical Center. Here is her contact information. I suggest you call and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. She will be able to conduct a thorough evaluation and determine if medical marijuana is appropriate for you. I must reiterate, Ms. Ranells, that I am not endorsing the use of medical marijuana, but rather providing you with a referral to a specialist who can make an informed decision based on your individual needs. Do you have any other questions before we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma, you say? Well, I suppose it's worth a try. I do appreciate you providing this. Although, honestly, all this running around is rather exhausting. No, I don't think I have any other questions, Doctor. Just… please tell my daughter I tried. She'll be terribly disappointed if this doesn't work out. And remind her that I'm still skeptical about all this… alternative medicine. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And please, no more poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ranells. I will be sure to document your concerns. I wish you the best of luck with Dr. Sharma. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day. .
