DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a significant amount, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Weight gain without lifestyle changes is concerning. How long have you been noticing this weight gain, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I believe, around late February. Perhaps early March. It’s been… gradual, but consistent. I noticed my clothes fitting tighter, and the scale… well, the scale kept going up. It’s about fifteen pounds, I’d say, maybe a little more.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in six months… that is notable. And you’re certain there haven’t been any changes to your usual eating habits or activity level?
PATIENT: Positive. Absolutely certain. I still prepare the same meals for my husband and myself – mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes, you know, potatoes, beets, some meat. And I still walk to the market most days, about a thirty-minute round trip. I haven’t started or stopped taking any medications either, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Traditional diets can be… calorically dense, Ms. Selbitschka. However, we’ll explore other possibilities. Let's get a more complete picture. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this weight gain?
PATIENT: I beg your pardon? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, Doctor. My grandmother lived to be ninety-two eating traditional foods. But, to answer your question… no, not really. I haven’t been feeling ill. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the summer heat. No aches, no pains, no changes in my… bowel habits, if you must know. Nothing obvious, at least.
DOCTOR: "Obvious" is rarely helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. We need specifics. Fatigue can be a symptom of… many things. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – thyroid problems, diabetes, perhaps high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. My family has good genes, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I do have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s very mild and doesn’t bother me much. The doctor back home – in Lithuania – ran blood tests regularly, and everything was always normal.
DOCTOR: Arthritis is… common. And regular blood work is… reassuring, I suppose. What about your family?
PATIENT: My mother lived to eighty-nine, and my father to seventy-five. Both died of heart problems, unfortunately. My sister is healthy, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other often – she emigrated to Canada years ago. No history of weight gain issues or… unusual illnesses, if that's what you're asking. My grandfather had some problems with his kidneys when he was older, but that was decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, I’m at a loss. This weight gain is very worrying, and I don't understand it.
DOCTOR: Worry is understandable, Ms. Selbitschka. However, attributing unexplained weight gain to “not understanding” is… unhelpful. Let’s proceed systematically. Do you take any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely none. I prefer to get my nutrients from whole foods, as my mother always taught me. I don’t believe in relying on pills or potions. Just a good, balanced diet and plenty of fresh air – that’s always been my philosophy. I occasionally have a cup of herbal tea – chamomile, for relaxation – but that’s the extent of it. I assure you, there’s nothing I’m taking that could be causing this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I find the habit… distasteful. My husband smokes occasionally – a pipe, after dinner – but he does so outside, and I avoid being near him when he does. I’ve always been very careful about my health, and I avoid things that could be harmful. I believe a healthy lifestyle is the key to a long and happy life. This weight gain is so… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I do not have a drinking problem. My husband and I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – perhaps once or twice a week, a small glass. Nothing excessive, certainly not enough to cause weight gain. We are, if anything, rather moderate in our habits. This line of questioning is beginning to feel… personal.
DOCTOR: I am merely gathering information, Ms. Selbitschka. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I need to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Please step on the scale again, and then we’ll proceed.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I doubt it will reveal anything new. There. Done.
DOCTOR: 83 kilograms. Height 155 centimeters. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 76. Respiration is 18. Heart sounds are normal, though slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Your weight is indeed elevated, Ms. Selbitschka, placing you in the overweight category. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid issues or diabetes. We'll also check your cholesterol levels.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, I suppose, that you’re taking it seriously. Though I maintain that there must be another explanation. I feel perfectly healthy, Doctor. But, yes, please, run the tests. Whatever it takes to find out what’s happening. When will I have the results?
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 48 to 72 hours. I will have the results sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend a modest reduction in caloric intake and an increase in physical activity. Perhaps reconsider the traditional Lithuanian diet. It is… rich. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: I believe I’ve answered all your questions, Doctor. And with all due respect, I find your comments about my diet… rather condescending. However, I will await the results of the tests. Thank you for your time. I do hope we can find an explanation for this soon. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in touch. .
