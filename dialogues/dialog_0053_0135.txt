DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pitmon. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. Some liquid is coming out. It started, let me see… about three days ago, I think. Tuesday? Yes, Tuesday it started.
DOCTOR: Tuesday, alright. And this liquid… can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, sometimes. Not much, but enough I notice it on my handkerchief. It does not… smell bad, if that is important. It just… is there. And it feels… wet, of course.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge, you say. And no odor. Hmm. Is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not exactly. Maybe… a little fullness? Like something is inside. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And my hearing feels… not as good in that ear. It is hard to explain. Sounds are… muffled.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, fullness… alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness alongside this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I feel… normal temperature, I believe. No chills either. And no… dizziness. I have not fallen, or felt like the room is spinning. Just the ear. Only the ear is bothering me. I did have a bit of a cold, maybe two weeks ago? But it was very mild. Just a little sniffle.
DOCTOR: A mild cold two weeks ago… alright. And have you noticed any ringing in your ear, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No ringing, Doctor. No. And my balance… I have not tripped, or felt unsteady. I walk the same as always, I think. I am careful, of course. I am not a young man anymore. But no change to my balance. It is just this… liquid. And the muffled hearing. I worry it is something serious.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be serious, but we should take a look. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table, and I’ll take a look in your ear. Have you had any ear tubes placed, or any prior ear surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have never had anything done to my ears before. No tubes, no surgery. Nothing. Everything is… original, you could say. I have just always had ears. Is that… a strange thing to say?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Radillo. Just confirming your history. Alright, let's take a look. If you could lie down on your side, with the affected ear facing up, please.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. This ear is the problem ear, yes? The right one. I am lying correctly? I am a little stiff this morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re perfect. And yes, the right ear. Hmm… well, there is some cerumen present, which is normal. But I also see some… inflammation of the ear canal. And a small amount of fluid, as you described. Your tympanic membrane appears intact, thankfully, but it's a bit dull. It looks like you have otitis externa – an outer ear infection, or swimmer’s ear. It’s likely a result of moisture getting trapped in the ear canal, potentially following your cold. Not a huge concern, but it needs treatment.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Swimmer’s ear? But I do not swim, Doctor. I have not been swimming in… many, many years. I live far from the ocean. Is it not only for swimmers? And what is… treatment? What must I do? I do not like the sound of “infection”.
DOCTOR: The name is misleading, Mr. Radillo. It doesn’t require swimming. Any moisture trapped in the ear canal can cause it – even from a humid environment or a cold. It's common. As for treatment, we'll use ear drops – an antibiotic and a steroid to reduce inflammation. I’ll write you a prescription. You'll need to instill these drops twice daily for seven days. Avoid getting water in your ear during that time. And absolutely no cotton swabs – they only push the wax further in and worsen the inflammation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Ear drops… twice a day for seven days. No water. No… cotton swabs. I have always used cotton swabs to clean my ears. I did not know it was bad. So, it is not a serious problem? Just… drops? And avoid water? I can do that. What happens if I… forget? Is it very dangerous if a little water gets in? And how do I… “instill” them? Do I just put them in my ear?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Radillo, it's not serious. But ignoring it could lead to more discomfort and potentially a more complicated infection. As for the drops... you tilt your head to the side, so the affected ear is facing up, and gently place 2-3 drops into the ear canal. It’s alright if they feel cool. A little water getting in is… not ideal, and could make the inflammation worse. Try your best to avoid it. I’ll have the nurse give you a handout with instructions. And please, no more cotton swabs. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. No more cotton swabs… I will remember that. And I will try very hard to avoid water. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for saying it is not… dangerous. I worry easily. I hope I do not bother you again soon. But if the problem does not improve… I will come back, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Radillo. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly with the handout and the prescription. Have a good day. .
