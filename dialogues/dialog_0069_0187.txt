DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just…chest pain. And my heart, it feels…flappy. Like fish. And the nurse, she said my blood pressure was high. Too high. I no like. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand. Chest pain and a feeling of your heart fluttering, and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. We'll definitely look into all of that. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. First, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more you want? It hurts. Dull ache, mostly. Sometimes…sharp. Comes and goes. It's been…a few days now, maybe. I don’t keep track of things like that. It's not…a bad pain, not like broken bone pain. Just…annoying. And worry me. That's why I here. Don't have time for pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache, sometimes sharp, coming and going for a few days, and it's worrying you. That's perfectly valid. It's good you’re listening to your body. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me what you're doing when it starts?
PATIENT: Doing? I'm…old. I do old man things. Sit. Watch TV. Eat. Sometimes walk to store, small store. Doesn't matter what I do. It just starts. Yesterday, sitting. Day before, walking. See? No pattern. I don't have time for patterns. Just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be linked to any specific activity. That’s helpful to know. And I appreciate your patience with me as we try to figure this out. Can you describe where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: Here. …Middle. Right here-ish. Sometimes…feels like it goes all over. Left side too. Hard to say. It's not like someone poking with needle. It's…spread out. I no know. You doctor. You tell me.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s hard to pinpoint. It sounds like it's mostly in the center of your chest, but can sometimes spread to the left side. Now, aside from the pain and the feeling in your heart, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I get tired, easy. Old man tired. Always tired. And I…short of breath sometimes. When I walk upstairs. Not big upstairs, just two floors. And… ...sweaty. A little sweaty. That's all I think. Maybe. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been feeling more tired than usual, a little short of breath when walking upstairs, and occasionally a bit sweaty. That’s good information to have. Do you have any history of heart problems, like a heart attack, or angina?
PATIENT: Angina? What is angina? Never heard of it. No. No heart problems. Never. Doctors always say I'm fine. Just old. I eat good food, mostly. Rice, fish, vegetables. Not like these young people with their…burgers and fries. No heart problems. Never. But now…this pain. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known history of heart problems. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, but it sounds like this is new for you. Let’s talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe. Nurse always say something about that. Always say "watch your salt." I watch! I try. But my wife, she likes salt. She likes kimchi. Lot of salt. I no know. Maybe. Everything else, no. Never sick. Good Korean genes. Very strong. But now…this pain is very worrying. I don’t like worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a history of high blood pressure, but you try to watch your salt intake. That's good to know. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? …Sometimes. Little white pill. For…stomach. My wife give me. Helps with the heartburn. That’s it. Just that one. And… vitamins. For old people. She make sure I take vitamins. She very bossy. But good wife. Except with the salt. And the kimchi.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a white pill for heartburn, and vitamins your wife gives you. Do you know the name of the white pill, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Name? Dosage? I no know! She give it to me! I just take it! She say it good for my stomach. I no ask questions. I just old man. She take care of things. You ask her. She like talking. Always talking. This is why I here. I want this pain gone. Not talk about pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand. We'll try to focus on the pain for now. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. ... No. I eat everything. Korean food, American food...everything. Maybe a little bit of trouble with shellfish, sometimes. But not big trouble. Just…itchy. Little itchy. But I still eat it. I like food. Too much trouble to not eat. No big allergies. Just…itchy sometimes. Now, this pain…is it serious? Will I die? That’s what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slight itchiness with shellfish, but otherwise no known allergies. I understand your concern about the pain and if it's serious. It’s good you're asking, and it’s definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Quick, you say? I have things to do. Not all day sitting here. And…no poking too much. Old bones. Very fragile. Just…get it over with. I want to know if I dying, okay? Is that too much to ask? Just tell me. Dying or not dying. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we’ll focus on a quick but thorough exam. I understand your concern, and we’ll do our best to figure out what's going on. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Old lungs. Not good. Hurry, okay? This is…uncomfortable. Feels like I haven't breathed in years. You find something wrong, tell me now. Don’t make me sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a bit labored, and I can hear some slight crackling in your lungs when you inhale deeply. Your heart rate is a little fast and irregular. Blood pressure is 160/95. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your chest to check for any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore.
PATIENT: Ow! Careful! That hurts. Here! …Right there. It’s always sore there. Especially when you push. You see? Something wrong. I knew it. This is why I came. Not good. Very not good. Is it…my heart? Am I having a heart attack now? Tell me! Stop poking!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your discomfort, and I’ll be very gentle. There is tenderness to palpation in the center of your chest. Given your symptoms – the chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling of your heart fluttering, and elevated blood pressure – and now this tenderness, we need to take this seriously. While it’s not possible to say definitively if you're having a heart attack without further testing, your symptoms are concerning enough that we need to rule one out immediately. We're going to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and I’m also going to order some blood tests, including cardiac enzymes, to see if there's any damage to your heart muscle. I'm also going to order a chest X-ray to check your lungs. It's important to act quickly in cases like this. I want to be cautious and make sure you get the best possible care. I’m going to call the nurses to get these tests ordered right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests?! I no want tests. I want answer! Am I dying or not dying?! You just tell me! I too old for tests. And…EKG? What is that? And blood? I don’t like blood. This is…too much. But…if you think I dying…then do whatever you need. Just…make it quick. Very quick. And tell my wife. She like knowing everything. Always knowing. Tell her I said hello. And maybe…bring me a glass of water? I thirsty. All this worrying…makes me thirsty.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and anxiety, Mr. Sobkowicz. I wish I could give you a simple answer right now, but unfortunately, I can’t diagnose you without doing these tests. They are crucial for figuring out what’s going on and making the right decision about your treatment. An EKG is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We just place some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t take long at all. And the blood test will help us check for any signs of heart damage. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. And of course, I will let your wife know about everything that's happening. Nurse, could you please come in here?
PATIENT: Old man problems… Always something. Tests, tests, tests… Just want to go home. But…maybe she right. Maybe need to know. If I dying, then at least wife know what to do. Tell nurse…be gentle. Old bones, you know. Very fragile.
DOCTOR: I've spoken to the nurse, and she understands to be very gentle. She’ll be in shortly to take your vitals and start the tests. We’ll do everything as quickly and comfortably as possible. In the meantime, try to relax and take some deep breaths. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait?
PATIENT: Comfortable? In this place? No. But… water. That would be nice. And… maybe tell me about the tests. What will happen? How long? Just…tell me what to expect. I don't like surprises. Old man gets scared easy. And… tell wife…I love her kimchi. Even with all the salt. Just tell her that. Okay? Now bring water. And tests information. Quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll explain everything as we go. First, the nurse will take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs again. Then, she will draw a small amount of blood for the cardiac enzyme tests. That will take just a few minutes. While she’s doing that, she’ll also prepare you for the EKG. For the EKG, she’ll place these small, sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs. They don’t hurt at all, it just feels a little cool. Then, a machine will record the electrical activity of your heart. It will only take about five minutes. You just need to lie still during the test. The results of the blood tests will take a little longer, maybe 30-45 minutes. Once we have those results, I can give you a better idea of what's going on and what our next steps will be. I've also let your wife know that you're here and that we're running some tests. I'll be sure to tell her you said you love her kimchi. Here’s some water for you. Please sip it slowly. Is there anything else I can get for you right now?
PATIENT: Water good. Okay. Tests…okay. Not fun. But okay. Wife know…good. She worry too much. But good wife. No… nothing else. Just… hurry. Tests, hurry. I want answer. Dying or not dying. That’s all. And…if I dying… tell her…make good kimchi. Extra spicy. Okay? Now start tests. Before I change my mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand your urgency, and we'll get these tests started right away. We will do everything as quickly as possible. I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Let's get started with the vitals and the blood draw, please. I'll be right here to assist if needed. Just try to relax and take some deep breaths. I'm here for you. And don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
