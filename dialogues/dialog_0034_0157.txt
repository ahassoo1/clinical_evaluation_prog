DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. The nurse said something about my blood pressure being high. Honestly, I feel fine. Just…fine. But my husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your husband to be proactive about your health, and I appreciate you coming in. Even if you feel fine, it's important to check things out. High blood pressure doesn't always have symptoms, which is why it's often called the "silent killer." To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit more about when you were last told your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated…right. The nurse at the clinic took it, yesterday, I think. Or maybe the day before. It was quick, just a cuff around my arm. She made a big deal of it, saying I needed to see you immediately. Honestly, I thought it was a waste of time. I work hard, I don't have time for…this. Is that all you need to know? When it was taken?
DOCTOR: Okay, yesterday or the day before. That’s helpful. And I understand your frustration with having to take time out of your day. We want to rule out anything serious, and sometimes a single reading isn't enough to get the full picture. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me if you've ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or if anyone in your family has a history of it?
PATIENT: No. Never been diagnosed with anything. And family… my mom was always pretty healthy, I guess. Dad…he smoked, if that matters. And drank. But I haven't seen him in years. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or am I just wasting my time? I have a bridge inspection to get back to. A real problem, unlike a slightly high number.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudney, and I want to assure you that we'll make this as efficient as possible. Knowing your family history helps me assess your risk. So, your mother was healthy and your father had a history of smoking. Thank you for sharing that. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or if you’re currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t do medical conditions. And medications? Absolutely not. I’m perfectly healthy, or I was until this whole blood pressure thing. Honestly, you doctors always want to put people on pills for everything. It’s ridiculous. I eat okay, I work hard, I sleep…well, I sleep when I can. What else do you need to know? Are you going to poke me now? Because if you are, just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, and I assure you I won’t prescribe anything unless absolutely necessary. My goal is to understand what's going on and help you stay healthy. Before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Seriously? I told you, I work. Hard. I’m a civil engineering technician. I inspect bridges, mostly. It’s…physical. Lots of walking, climbing, being outside. And I drive. A lot. That's it. I don't sit around eating junk food, if that's what you're asking. I don't have time for hobbies or… relaxing. Is that good enough? I’m a practical person. I deal with real problems, not…whatever this is.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Dudney. It sounds like you have a physically demanding job, which is excellent. Knowing that helps me understand your overall health profile. Just a few more questions, then we can move to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, are you investigating me now? This is getting ridiculous. I already told you, my father drank, but I don't. And no, I don't smoke. And absolutely not. I have a job that requires clear thinking and good judgment. I don’t need to be impaired. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Is this going to take much longer? I have a schedule to keep. People are depending on me.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Dudney. I'm just trying to gather all the necessary information to understand your health and provide the best possible care. You’re right, it’s important to respect your time. Okay, so no smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drugs. That’s good. Before we proceed with the physical exam, could you tell me if you've been experiencing any symptoms like headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No! None of that. Like I said, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I’m a little stressed, maybe, because I’m wasting my time here, but that’s it. Headaches? No. Vision changes? No. I can see just fine. Chest pain? Absolutely not. And my ankles are perfectly normal, thank you very much. Honestly, I think I’m done answering questions. Can we just…get this over with? I need to be getting back to work. This is taking way too long. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. I understand your frustration. Let's proceed with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and do a quick neurological assessment. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll get started. It shouldn't take long. And please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam.
