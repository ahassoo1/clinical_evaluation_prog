DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Aurthur Benic. Good to meet ye, Doctor… Overgaard, is it? I hope I’m no’ botherin’ ye too much this mornin’.
DOCTOR: Overgaard, yes. And you're not bothering me, precisely. Though I do have a fairly full schedule. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Well, it’s been a bit o’ a bother, truth be told. For the past few weeks, I’ve been feelin’ quite sick to me stomach first thing in the mornin’. Not proper sick, mind ye, more like a… queasy feelin’. And it's been happenin’ more often lately. I was told to come in about it, seein’ as how me heart’s not what it used to be. I get winded easily, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Right, nausea in the mornings, worsening over the past few weeks, and you mentioned some shortness of breath… and the heart issue. Let’s clarify a few things. When you say “not proper sick,” can you describe what you do experience?
PATIENT: Aye, o’ course. It’s no’ like a vomitin’ sort o’ sick, if ye follow. More like… a rollin’ in me stomach, ye ken? Like I’ve eaten somethin’ that disnae agree wi’ me, but I haven’t. And it comes on quick, as soon as I sit up in bed. It usually passes after a bit, maybe an hour or so, but it’s enough to ruin me start to the day. No’ much of an appetite after it neither. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… adequately descriptive. So, a rolling sensation, immediate upon rising, lasting about an hour, accompanied by a loss of appetite. And this has been occurring…how frequently, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, at first it was only a couple o’ times a week. Maybe twice, three times. But the last week or so, it’s been nearly every mornin’. Five times, I reckon. Maybe six. It’s a bit hard to keep track when ye’re feelin’ poorly, ye understand. It’s not terribly violent, mind ye, just…unpleasant. Enough to make me dread gettin’ outta bed, to be honest. I’ve been tryin’ to eat lighter in the evenin’, seein’ as how that's when it might be startin’, but it’s no’ made much difference.
DOCTOR: Right. Daily nausea for the past week, no change with dietary adjustments. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Any dizziness when you get up?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… there is a bit o’ a wooziness. No’ a proper faintin’ spell, mind ye, more like the room spins for a few seconds. It usually goes away quick, just as the queasy feelin’ comes on. I just put it down to gettin’ old and movin’ too fast, to be honest. But ye're askin’ specifically, so I thought I’d better tell ye. It's not constant, just when I sit up in the mornin', along wi’ the rest o’ it. I’ve been takin’ me time gettin’ up, mind ye, tryin’ to be careful.
DOCTOR: Dizziness coinciding with the nausea. And you said you’ve noticed shortness of breath previously. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, aye. It’s no’ like a wheezin’ sort o’ shortness o’ breath, more like… I just cannae get a proper deep breath. It happens when I’m exertin’ myself, mostly. Walkin’ up a hill, carryin’ somethin’ heavy, that sort o’ thing. Even climbin’ a few stairs can leave me breathless. It’s gotten a bit worse lately, I reckon, though it’s hard to say for sure. I just put it down to me age, and…well, the doctor told me a while back about me heart not bein’ as strong as it used to be. It’s no’ a sudden thing, mind ye, it’s been comin’ on gradually for years.
DOCTOR: Right. Gradual onset shortness of breath, dizziness, and now daily morning nausea. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. Not a twinge, not a flutter, nothin’. It’s mostly just the queasiness, the dizziness, and the breathlessness. Sometimes, I get a bit o’ a funny feelin’ in me jaw, like a tightness, but that’s only now and again. It doesn't last long, and I just thought it was me teeth. I’ve been to the dentist recently, and he said they’re fine. So, no, no chest pain. That's somethin’ I’ve been careful to watch out for, seein’ as how ye mentioned me heart. It’s just the other things that are botherin’ me. I’m no’ wantin’ to be a bother, Doctor. Is this somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're being observant. The jaw tightness is…noted. We’ll need to explore that further. Now, let’s go back a bit. Any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Aye, now ye’re askin’. I… well, I’ve been a bit… irregular, ye could say. Not proper diarrhea, mind ye, but… softer than usual. And I’ve been goin’ to the… lavatory… more often than usual. It’s been happenin’ at the same time as the queasiness, I reckon. It's not terribly painful, just… inconvenient. I just thought it was somethin’ I ate. I've been tryin’ to drink more water, seein’ as how I’ve been feelin’ a bit poorly. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, to be honest. Is this all connected, do ye think? I feel like I’m fallin’ apart, Doctor. It's the heart, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table, please. Then we can discuss possible causes and what steps we need to take.
PATIENT: Aye, o’ course. Anything ye need. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'm ready when ye are. It's just... I’m no’ as nimble as I used to be, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a bit irregular, as expected. Murmur present, grade 2/6. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Some tenderness in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright, Mr. Benic. Given your history of heart issues, the recent onset of daily nausea, dizziness, changes in bowel habits, and the findings on examination, I suspect several possibilities. It could be related to your cardiac function, or it could be a gastrointestinal issue. Your symptoms are also somewhat suggestive of… well, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for infection. We'll also need an EKG to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood tests and a… stool sample. Right. I suppose it’s best to be sure. And the EKG… will that be painful? I've never had one before. I understand ye need to rule things out. What sort of things are ye thinkin’ about, if ye don’t mind me askin’? I’m no’ tryin’ to pry, just… tryin’ to understand. Is it somethin’ serious? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a bit o’ a garden that needs tendin’ to, ye ken. And I promised me niece I’d help her with her… well, never mind. Just how long? And is it somethin’ I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless, Mr. Benic. It simply involves placing electrodes on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. As for what I’m considering… well, given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out cardiac ischemia, meaning reduced blood flow to the heart, and also consider possibilities like gastritis, or an infection causing your gastrointestinal symptoms. A less likely, but still possible consideration, given the changes in bowel habits, is an underlying malignancy. I realize that's… concerning to hear, but it's important to be thorough. The lab results should be available within 48-72 hours. I will call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet—avoid spicy or fatty foods—and stay well-hydrated. For now, I don’t want you to panic. We’re taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. The tests will give us a clearer picture. Is there anything else you’d like to ask before we finish?
PATIENT: A… malignancy. Right. That’s… not good, is it? I understand ye need to be thorough, but… that’s a bit scary. Bland diet, stay hydrated… I can manage that. I’ll try not to worry. But it’s difficult, ye ken? Especially when ye hear somethin’ like that. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Just… thank ye, Doctor. For explainin’ things. And for not… sugarcoating it. I appreciate that. I’ll wait for the phone call. And I’ll try to keep busy. It's good to know ye're lookin’ into it. Aye. Thank ye again.
