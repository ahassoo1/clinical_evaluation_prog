DOCTOR: Well, hello Early. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Renzi, yes? Good day to you too. I need… a card. A get well card. From you. You are a doctor, after all. It’s for a… friend. A very important friend. It just needs to say something nice. You know, encouragement. People need encouragement these days.
DOCTOR: A get-well card… right. Of course. That’s… certainly a request I can help with. Though, usually folks come to see me when they’re feeling unwell, not to send well wishes. But, happy to oblige. Could you tell me a little more about your friend?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, it’s not about why I need it, it's that I need it. A proper card, with a doctor's signature. Makes a difference, you know? People listen to doctors. It's… respect. I don’t want to get into the details of who this is for. It's… personal. Are you going to write the card or not? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get frustrated. I understand it's personal. I can certainly write a card. Just…to clarify, is there anything specific you'd like me to write?
PATIENT: Something…positive. Encouraging. Like… “Get better soon, you are strong!” Or… “Thinking of you, stay positive.” Something like that. Just… don’t make it sound silly. And sign it properly. “Dr. Renzi.” Not just “Nate.” You are a doctor, remember? A professional.
DOCTOR: “Wishing you a swift recovery and sending positive thoughts for strength and well-being. – Dr. Renzi.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: “Swift recovery…” Sounds… okay. But a little… bland. Couldn't you put something a little more… heartfelt? Like, “Wishing you all the best” or… “Hoping for a speedy return to health?” Something with more… feeling. It's supposed to cheer someone up, Doctor. Not sound like a grocery list.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try this. “Hoping for a speedy return to health and sending my best wishes for strength and well-being. – Dr. Renzi.” Is that better?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… acceptable. Finally. Can I have it now? I need to get this to my… friend. Quickly. Do you need me to fill out any forms? Or is this… done? I do have other things to attend to, you see. Important things.
DOCTOR: Here you go. And no, no forms are necessary. This is all done. I'm glad I could help. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, Early?
PATIENT: No. That will be all, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. Don't waste my time again. .
DOCTOR: Alright then… have a good day, Early. .
