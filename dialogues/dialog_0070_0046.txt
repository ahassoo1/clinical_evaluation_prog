DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Creagh, frequent and uncomfortable bladder pressure. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, maybe a month ago? At first, I just thought I was drinking too much water, but it hasn’t gotten better, even when I try to limit my fluids. I find myself needing to go to the bathroom much more often than usual, even if I haven't had much to drink. And sometimes, when I do go, it feels like I don't fully empty my bladder. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s been about a month, and it’s not improving with fluid restriction. Increased frequency, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no pain in my back, and nothing in my urine that I've noticed. I haven't been feeling particularly tired, either. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more… anxious lately, though I didn’t necessarily connect it to this. Just general worry, I suppose. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Ms. Creagh. No fever, no back pain, no changes in your urine, and some increased anxiety. Anxiety can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms, so that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, as my husband and I are both seniors now. I’ve had the usual check-ups and vaccinations, but no serious illnesses or conditions. I've never had any problems with my bladder or kidneys before this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No prior medical conditions. And you're covered by Medicare, which is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky in that regard, thankfully. Nothing major, or even minor, really. I've never needed any surgical procedures at all. Just the regular dental work, of course. I do take a daily vitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Daily vitamin is good to know, though generally those aren't a concern. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or any similar urinary symptoms in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… my mother had a bladder infection once, a long time ago, but she recovered quickly. My grandmother, on my father’s side, had some issues with… incontinence later in life, I believe. Nothing else that I’m aware of. My husband’s family is healthy as well, as far as I know. Would knowing more specifically what kind of kidney problems would be helpful, Doctor? I’m not very familiar with medical terms.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Ms. Creagh. A past bladder infection in your mother and some incontinence in your grandmother. Knowing the specifics wouldn't be crucial at this point, but thank you for offering. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to maintain a healthy diet and get regular exercise – mostly walking, when the weather permits. I’ve always been careful about what I put into my body, Doctor. I hope that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Creagh. Non-smoker, minimal alcohol, healthy diet, and regular exercise. That’s all very positive. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, besides your daily vitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the vitamin. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, or over-the-counter, really. I try to avoid medications whenever possible, preferring to address things through diet and lifestyle. I’m very careful about what I put into my body, as I mentioned before. I hope that helps paint a full picture, Doctor. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications besides the daily vitamin. Thank you for providing all of that information, Ms. Creagh; it’s very helpful. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will include listening to your abdomen, and a gentle external examination of your abdomen and back. We may also need to do a simple urine test to rule out any infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A physical exam and urine test seem sensible. I trust your judgment and want to get to the bottom of this. Please proceed when you’re ready. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Creagh. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, just to check for any unusual sounds. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen sounds normal, Ms. Creagh. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Again, please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I don’t feel any significant tenderness. Now, I will gently palpate your lower back. Your back feels normal as well. Now, if you could provide a urine sample, that would be helpful. There is a collection cup in the restroom. I'll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ll be right back with the sample.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I’m going to send this off to the lab for analysis. It will take a few minutes to get the results. While we are waiting, I want to ask a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, odor, or frequency—besides the increased need to go?
PATIENT: No, nothing noticeable about the color or odor. It looks and smells… normal, as far as I can tell. The only change has been the amount I’m producing, and how often I need to go, as we’ve discussed. Oh! Now that you mention it, I did notice it seemed a little… cloudy once, but I chalked that up to dehydration. It hasn’t happened again. Is that significant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Creagh. A one-time occurrence of cloudy urine could be related to dehydration, but it's good you mentioned it. While we wait for the lab results, let's briefly discuss your anxiety. Has anything specific been causing you stress lately, or is it more of a general feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… more of a general feeling, I suppose, Doctor. My husband and I recently retired, which was a big change, and I’ve been… adjusting. It’s not anything dramatic, just a bit of uncertainty about the future, I think. We’ve always been busy, and now we have a lot more time on our hands. It’s a good problem to have, but it’s still a little unsettling. I've also been worried about my mother's health, though she says she's doing fine. Perhaps it’s a combination of things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Creagh. Retirement is a significant life transition, and it's perfectly normal to feel some anxiety during that process. Worrying about your mother's health adds another layer to that. Okay, the preliminary lab results are back. The urine analysis shows no evidence of infection, which is good. However, there is a slightly elevated level of white blood cells, which could indicate some mild inflammation, but it’s not definitive. Given your symptoms, the absence of infection, the mild elevation in white blood cells, and your reported anxiety, it’s possible that you’re experiencing what’s called bladder irritative symptoms potentially triggered by stress or anxiety. These symptoms can cause frequent urination, urgency, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to recommend a bladder scan to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after urination to get a better understanding. It is non-invasive. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A bladder scan… that sounds reasonable, Doctor. If it can help determine the cause, then yes, absolutely. Non-invasive is good. I trust your judgment and want to be thorough. So, it will show how much urine is left after I go to the bathroom? That makes sense. Let’s proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Creagh. This is a very simple procedure. I’m going to use this handheld device to scan your abdomen. You don’t need to do anything special; just lie comfortably on the examination table. It’s completely painless and non-invasive. Okay, the scan shows a small amount of residual urine—approximately 50 milliliters—which is within the normal range. This is reassuring, as it suggests your bladder is emptying adequately. Given all of the information—the negative urine culture, the small amount of residual urine, and your reported anxiety—I believe the most likely diagnosis is bladder irritative symptoms exacerbated by stress and anxiety. However, because symptoms can be caused by many things, I want to make sure we're not missing anything. To be completely thorough, I recommend a consultation with a urologist. They are specialists in urinary health and can provide a comprehensive evaluation and rule out any other potential causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A consultation with a urologist… that sounds sensible, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, as they say. It’s good to know you’re being thorough and considering all possibilities. I appreciate that. I trust your professional judgment, and if you recommend it, then I’m happy to see a specialist. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the appointment, or any specific questions I should ask?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you agree. I will send a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly regarded urologist in the area. I'll also send your medical records, including the lab results and scan results. To prepare for the appointment, it would be helpful to keep a voiding diary for a few days. This involves recording the time and amount of each urination, as well as any associated symptoms, such as urgency or discomfort. It will give Dr. Ramirez a better understanding of your urinary habits. As for questions to ask, you could inquire about potential causes of your symptoms, available treatment options, and lifestyle modifications that might help. Don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have, no matter how small they may seem. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your stress levels through relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Staying hydrated is also important, but avoid excessive fluid intake before bedtime. I'm going to write a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication that you can use as needed if you feel your symptoms are particularly bothersome. It's not a long-term solution, but it may help provide some temporary relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A voiding diary, a list of questions, and the medication… it’s a good plan. I will certainly keep the diary and make a note of the questions. And I appreciate the prescription; it’s reassuring to have something available if needed. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly and for being so attentive to my concerns. I feel much better equipped to manage this now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I'm glad I could help. No, there’s nothing else you need to do before you leave. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion, including the voiding diary instructions and a list of local resources for stress management. I will also send a follow-up message to schedule a check-in appointment in a month to see how you're doing. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Here's the prescription. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything wonderfully. Thank you again for your time, your patience, and your thoroughness. I feel much more at ease now, and I appreciate your kindness. Have a good day, Doctor Abady. And thank you to your staff as well. I’ll be sure to keep the diary and follow up as recommended.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
