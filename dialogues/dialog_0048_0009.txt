DOCTOR: Right. Mr. AlCorta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Delano AlCorta. Though, honestly, most folks just call me Del. But formality is… appreciated, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. AlCorta. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Sink, is it? Yes. I’m here about my vision. It’s… deteriorating. Has been for some time, truth be told. It's just gotten to the point where I can't not address it anymore. It’s becoming… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: “Deteriorating.” Right. And how long has this “deterioration” been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. It’s been… gradual. Probably… six months, maybe a little longer? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I don't make a habit of tracking such things. It was just a little blurry at first, easily dismissed. Now… well, now it’s noticeable. And bothersome.
DOCTOR: “Noticeable and bothersome.” Can you describe the blurriness, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: It's not… a consistent blur, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s like looking through a dirty window. Other times, it's more like… patches. Sections of my vision are clearer than others. And at night… well, driving is becoming a rather unpleasant experience. Everything has a halo around it. Quite distracting, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Patches… halos… Right. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me see. No… not really. No pain, no floaters, no… flashing lights, or anything dramatic like that. Just the… diminishing clarity. Though, I have been bumping into things more frequently. My wife – my ex-wife, I should say – always said I was clumsy. Perhaps it’s just a natural extension of that. But it seems… more pronounced lately.
DOCTOR: “More pronounced.” And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. Prefer natural remedies, you see. Though, admittedly, they don’t seem to be doing much for this particular ailment. I take a daily multivitamin, if that counts. And occasionally, ibuprofen for… minor aches and pains. Nothing consistent, I assure you. I’m a fairly healthy man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I spent a good deal of my youth outdoors, you see. Running around in the woods, hunting, fishing… you develop a certain resilience. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Though, I do find ragweed irritating. But I wouldn’t call that an allergy, exactly. Just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your eyes then. Please, have a seat in the examination chair.
PATIENT: Very well. I trust this won’t be… too lengthy a process? I have a rather full afternoon.
DOCTOR: Just focus on the chart, Mr. AlCorta. We’ll keep it brief. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Oh, dear. That’s… rather small. I can make out the… first few letters. But it’s quite blurry. E… F… perhaps a P? It's difficult to be certain. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t had my eyes checked in… well, quite some time. I always assumed they were perfectly adequate. This is rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: 20/70, right eye. 20/80, left eye. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. No obvious clouding of the lens. Fundi appear normal, although… mild drusen present in both eyes. This is… not surprising, given your age.
PATIENT: Drusen? Is that… something serious? I confess, I’m not overly familiar with medical terminology. My ex-wife always handled these sorts of things. She had a… knack for understanding these reports. Is it… curable? Or is this a… progressive condition? I do dislike ambiguity, Doctor. A straightforward answer would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Drusen are small deposits under the retina. Common with aging. Not immediately dangerous, but they can indicate the beginning stages of macular degeneration. It’s not “curable,” Mr. AlCorta, but it is manageable. We'll need to rule out other causes, of course. Consider a dilated eye exam. And possibly, some baseline optical coherence tomography. I’m going to refer you to an ophthalmologist. They’ll be able to provide you with a more detailed assessment and discuss treatment options.
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? More specialists? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for a simple solution. A drop, perhaps? Or a change in diet? I'm not keen on being passed around. And “treatment options”? What sort of treatment options are we discussing? Injections? Surgery? I assure you, I'm not one for drastic measures. Is this… going to be expensive? My insurance situation is… complicated.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. AlCorta, I'm an Internal Medicine physician. I can assess general health, but diagnosing and treating complex eye conditions is outside my scope of practice. The ophthalmologist will determine the best course of action. As for cost… that’s something you’ll need to discuss with their office. I can provide you with a referral to a few specialists in the area. Here. It’s imperative you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Delaying treatment can worsen the condition. I’ve documented my findings. I suggest you follow up with the specialist and abide by their recommendations. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: “Abide by their recommendations.” No, Doctor. I believe that concludes our… exchange. I confess, this has been… less than satisfactory. But I suppose it’s better than nothing. Thank you for your time, Doctor Sink. I will… consider your advice. .
