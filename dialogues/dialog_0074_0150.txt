DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, frankly, it's rather simple. I want a baby. And I want it to be…easy. I'm not getting any younger, you know. I've heard horror stories about…complications. I’d like to avoid all that if possible. Is that…understandable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg, that's perfectly understandable. It’s wise to be proactive about planning for pregnancy, especially as you get older. And wanting a smooth process is entirely reasonable. To help me understand your situation and give you the best advice, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been trying to conceive for a while now, or is this just the beginning of your planning?
PATIENT: Planning. Definitely planning. I haven't…started yet. I thought I'd get a checkup before all that. Preventative, you see? I’m divorced, and frankly, my ex…wasn’t the most reliable. I don’t want to waste time with…problems. And I'd like to know if there are problems before I even bother. Do you understand? It's about efficiency.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Shteynberg. Planning ahead and ensuring you're in the best possible health before trying to conceive is a very sensible approach. It’s excellent that you're being so proactive. Okay, let's gather some information. First, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps…nothing serious. I broke my wrist when I was fourteen, a rather clumsy accident involving a bicycle, naturally. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that…I generally keep myself in good condition. I cycle, you know. It’s good exercise. I don’t take any regular medications, apart from the occasional pain reliever for…arthritis. It’s in my hands. A nuisance, really. Is that enough? Or do you need a detailed list of every cough and cold I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good start, Ms. Shteynberg. Thank you. No, we certainly don't need a list of every cough and cold! The childhood illnesses, broken wrist, gallbladder removal, and arthritis are all important to know. Regarding the arthritis, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my hands, like I said. It flares up when it's cold or if I overdo it on the cycling. It's not debilitating, but it can be quite painful. I use some cream sometimes, and I try to avoid strenuous activity when it’s acting up. I haven't seen a specialist for it, really. I just…manage it. I’m not one for fussing over things. Is that…sufficient? I assume you'll want to know about…family history next? Because honestly, my mother’s side…well, let’s just say there were a lot of complications. A lot.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Shteynberg. Managing it yourself with cream and modifying your activity is reasonable, especially if it’s not debilitating. We can certainly discuss it further if needed. Yes, let’s move on to family history. Knowing what’s been common in your family can help us assess your risk factors. Could you tell me about any significant medical conditions that run in your family, particularly on your mother’s side, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? On my mother's side…my grandmother had…diabetes, I believe. And my aunt had…breast cancer. Quite young, actually. And my cousin…she had trouble conceiving, multiple miscarriages. It was a whole ordeal. And my mother herself…well, her pregnancies were…difficult. Very difficult. She was very frail, and she had…complications after each birth. High blood pressure, I think. It was a mess. Honestly, it's a rather grim picture, isn't it? I'm starting to wonder if this is even worth it. But I want a baby. A healthy baby. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shteynberg, that’s absolutely not too much to ask. It's completely understandable to feel concerned given your family history, and it's very good that you're aware of these potential risks. Knowing this allows us to be proactive and take appropriate steps. Given your family history of diabetes, breast cancer, and pregnancy complications, we'll want to do some screening tests to assess your own risk factors. Would you be comfortable with me briefly reviewing your current medications, allergies, and social history – things like smoking, alcohol use, and your general lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, get it over with. I don't smoke. Never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three times a week. Not a heavy drinker. I don't do…drugs. Allergies…dust, mostly. And cats. I try to avoid them. Lifestyle…well, I cycle. As I’ve mentioned repeatedly. I eat reasonably well. I'm not a gourmet cook, but I don't eat junk food. I live alone, obviously. Divorced, as you know. I don’t really do much socializing. It's all rather…mundane, really. Are you writing all this down? It's quite depressing when you put it all in writing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Ms. Shteynberg. And it's not depressing – it's helpful. It gives me a complete picture of your health and lifestyle, and it allows me to provide you with the best possible care. A glass of wine three times a week is perfectly reasonable. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your past surgical history. You mentioned your gallbladder removal. Were there any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: No, none at all. It was quite routine, thankfully. I was in and out in a few days. No infections, no issues. The doctors were…competent. It was years ago, of course. I don't remember all the details. Honestly, I try not to dwell on medical things. It gives me anxiety. Is that…sufficient? Can we get on with the exam? I'd like to be finished with this as quickly as possible. I have…commitments.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. That's very good to know. No complications from the gallbladder removal is excellent. Alright, let's proceed with a physical exam. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also perform a basic abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, just get it over with. Quickly, if you please. I really don't enjoy being prodded and poked. I’m rather sensitive. And please, no unnecessary conversation. I’d prefer to remain…silent. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything appears normal so far. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a Vitamin D level. I also recommend a urine test to check for any infections. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Just…get it done. The less time I spend here, the better. Vitamin D…is that necessary? I get some sun when I cycle. But if you insist…just do it. I don’t want to argue about it. I have a…deadline. Can I get the results quickly? I don’t want to have to come back here multiple times. I really need to know if there’s a problem. Or if this whole thing is a waste of time. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even coming. Is there anything else? Or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Shteynberg. We will expedite the lab work as much as possible. Typically, the results are available within 3-5 business days. We can arrange to have them sent to you electronically, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Regarding the Vitamin D, it’s often low even in people who get some sun exposure, and it plays a role in overall health and fertility. It’s just a simple test, and it’s good to have a baseline. For now, I'll order the blood work and urine test. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. I’ll also provide you with a requisition form for the lab work. Do you have any questions about where to go for the tests?
PATIENT: No. Just give me the paper. I'll find it. Honestly, I’m perfectly capable of handling things myself. I don't need to be coddled. Is that all? Can I go now? I have…things to do. Important things. This has been…a waste of time, frankly. But if you think these tests are necessary…fine. Just get it over with. And please, don’t call me unless there’s a serious problem. I don’t want to hear about minor fluctuations. Is that understood? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. The requisition form is for [Lab Name and Address]. We will only contact you if there are any concerning results. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best. .
