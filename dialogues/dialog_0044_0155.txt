DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. This tremor, I think they called it on the phone. It’s… bothersome. Honestly, I don't remember all the details anymore. It’s just… my hands. They shake. Been happening for… a while now, I guess. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s possible. I haven’t got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. A tremor can certainly be bothersome. And I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. “A while now” is a bit vague, though – could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea… hmm. Let me think… maybe six months? Or was it longer? It started gradually, you know? Just a little shake, barely noticeable. Now… well, now it’s harder to ignore. I used to be able to hold a wrench steady, working at the plant. Not so much anymore. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. Six months of gradual onset. And it’s affecting your ability to do things you used to be able to do, like working with tools. That's helpful information. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not always shaking, no. It’s worse when I try to do something… precise. Like writing, or… well, holding that wrench like I said. When I'm just sitting, it's usually not too bad. Though sometimes… sometimes it just happens, you know? For no reason at all. It’s just… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable shaking, worse with precise movements… alright. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know. Coffee, maybe? I drink a lot of coffee. But I’ve always drank a lot of coffee. And… stress, probably. Working at the plant was stressful, even after I retired, thinking about it. But I can't say for sure. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything precisely. We’ll try to piece things together. You mentioned coffee and stress. And you said it's been gradually worsening over the past six months. Now, do you notice the tremor anywhere else besides your hands?
PATIENT: Goodness… anywhere else? I hadn’t really thought about it. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a little shaky in my legs, but I just figured that was… old age, you know? Or maybe just tiredness. I haven't paid it much mind. It’s mostly the hands. That’s what bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly the hands, but occasional shakiness in the legs. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. And… sometimes my handwriting is worse than usual. But again, that could be the shaking, right? Or just… getting older. I'm not a young man anymore, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you're not. And it's good you're letting me know all of this. Fatigue and worsening handwriting along with the tremor… alright. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. High blood pressure, I think? And… a bad back, once. But that was a long time ago. I don't remember much about it. I've been to doctors, of course, over the years, but I don't keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in the past and a history of back problems. Do you recall what, if anything, you were treated with for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... pills, I think. Little white pills. I took them for a while, then… well, then I stopped. The doctor said it was under control, so I figured I didn't need them anymore. It was a long time ago, though. I don't remember the name of the pills, or even which doctor prescribed them. I just remember stopping them.
DOCTOR: Okay, discontinued medication for high blood pressure. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Nothing at all. Just… coffee. I told you, I drink a lot of coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications, just coffee. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. I'm not a picky eater. I suppose I could be allergic to something, but I haven't figured it out yet.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – ever been diagnosed with a neurological condition like Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s another hard one, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about those things. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands, later in life, but I don’t know what it was. And my father… he just died suddenly, heart attack, I think. I don't recall anyone having anything… serious like Parkinson's or… whatever the other one was.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited family history available. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I’m divorced. Been divorced for… a long time. I used to work at the water treatment plant, you know? I retired a few years ago. Now… I mostly keep to myself. I don’t have many friends. I live alone. It's… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Retired, divorced, living alone. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never had any interest in it. Always thought it was a foolish habit. And… no drinking, either. Not much of a drinker. Just… coffee, like I said. I seem to be stuck on that coffee, don't I?
DOCTOR: It seems you are. Alright, no smoking, no drinking. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to take a closer look at your hands. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I've got things to do, you know? The sooner we figure out what's going on with these hands, the better. But… be gentle, alright? They're a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… excellent. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I notice a tremor in both hands, resting tremor, more noticeable on your right side. I also note a slight pallor and a little stiffness. Could you extend your arms in front of you, palms up, for a moment?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… not easy. They just… shake. I feel a bit silly, standing here like this. This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: It's… harder than it looks! My hand just won't cooperate. See? It's shaking. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It is more difficult when there's a tremor. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and I notice some increased muscle tone. Based on what I've observed, and your history, I suspect we’re dealing with an essential tremor, possibly with some early signs of Parkinsonism. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes, and I think an MRI of your brain would be helpful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI… more tests? Goodness… I just want it to stop shaking, Doctor. All these tests… it sounds complicated. Is it serious? Parkinsonism… that sounds… bad. Look, I'm an old man. I don't want to spend the rest of my days going through tests. Can't you just give me something to calm my hands? Something to make it stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. It is a lot, and I apologize for that. You’re right to ask if it’s serious. Essential tremor itself isn’t life-threatening, but it can be very bothersome. And the possibility of early Parkinsonism… well, that needs to be investigated to understand the best course of action. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have Parkinson’s disease, but it’s important to rule it out or confirm it. We can certainly discuss medication options to help manage the tremor. There are medications that can reduce the shaking, but they don’t always work for everyone, and they can have side effects. The tests will help us determine if medication is the right approach, and if so, which one would be most suitable. Would you be open to discussing the blood work and MRI?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright. I suppose I can handle blood work. It's quick enough. But that MRI… is it expensive? And will it take long? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have much money, and I don’t have much time. I just want to get this sorted, one way or another. If it's going to cost a fortune and take weeks, then… then maybe I’ll just have to learn to live with it.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concerns about cost and time. Let me explain. The blood work is relatively inexpensive and usually takes just a few days to get the results back. The MRI is more costly, typically around \$800 to \$1200, depending on insurance coverage and the facility. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. Given your financial concerns, we can explore options for financial assistance programs or negotiate a lower rate with the imaging center. We can also prioritize the blood work first, and then decide about the MRI based on the results. If the blood work is normal, we might consider a trial of medication for the tremor without pursuing the MRI. Would you like me to have my staff look into financial assistance options for the MRI, and we can discuss medication options in the meantime?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. Financial assistance… that sounds good. And yes, let’s talk about the medication. If there’s something that can just… calm my hands a little, then I’m willing to try it. Just… nothing too complicated, alright? And nothing with too many side effects. I’m an old man, remember? I don’t need any more problems.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I understand. We’ll start with something simple and monitor for any side effects closely. There are a few medications commonly used for essential tremor, such as propranolol and primidone. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, often used for high blood pressure, and it can sometimes reduce tremor. Primidone is an anticonvulsant that can also be effective. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, propranolol might be a good starting point. However, it can sometimes cause fatigue or dizziness. We would start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your blood pressure and any potential side effects. Would you be comfortable trying a low dose of propranolol?
PATIENT: Propranolol… another pill, then. Well, I suppose it’s worth a try. If it can calm my hands, and it helps with the blood pressure, then… alright. Low dose, you said? And we’ll monitor it? Good. I don’t want any surprises. Just… let’s get this over with, alright? The sooner I can stop shaking, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a prescription for a low dose of propranolol, 20 milligrams twice a day. We’ll start with that and see how you tolerate it. I’ll also give you a list of potential side effects to watch out for, such as fatigue, dizziness, or slow heart rate. I’ll also have my staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your response to the medication and discuss the results of the blood work. And they will also help you explore financial assistance options for the MRI, if you decide to pursue it. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for trying to help. I just want my life back, you know? Before these hands started shaking.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. And you’re very welcome. I’m here to help you get your life back. We'll work together to find a solution that works for you. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. My staff will be with you shortly to finalize the paperwork and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… thank you again.
