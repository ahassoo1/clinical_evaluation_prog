DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, it’s about having a baby. Or, not having problems having a baby, if you understand what I mean. I’m 51, you know. Time isn’t exactly on my side, and frankly, I don’t want any… complications. I’d like to know what can be done to… ensure things go smoothly, if I decide to try. Quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Angelle. It’s very wise to be proactive about this, especially considering your age. We want to do everything we can to give you the best chance of a healthy pregnancy, if that’s your decision. First, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, one. A very long time ago. It… didn’t go well. Complicated delivery, lots of trouble. Ended in a C-section, naturally. I’ve always been perfectly healthy otherwise, though. Never much for doctors, to be honest. Always just a waste of time. And honestly, I’m not sure I want to relive all the details of that. Is it absolutely necessary to go into all of that? I just want to know what tests I need, not rehash old news.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Angelle. We don’t need to go into every detail if you’re not comfortable. Knowing there was a previous complicated delivery and C-section is helpful, and we can certainly focus on moving forward. To get a better understanding of your current health and assess your readiness for pregnancy, I'd like to discuss some tests. These will help us identify any potential risks and ensure you’re in the best possible condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. Everything is tests these days. Fine, get on with it. But I expect a clear explanation of why each test is necessary, and what it even means. None of this… doctor speak. And quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Clear explanations are exactly what I aim for. We'll go through everything step-by-step. First, we’ll do a complete physical exam, including blood pressure, weight, and a general health assessment. This just gives us a baseline. Then, we'll need some blood work. This will check things like your complete blood count – to rule out anemia, your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels – to check for diabetes, and your hormone levels to assess your ovarian function. We'll also check for immunity to certain infections like rubella and varicella, which can be harmful during pregnancy. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Rubella? Varicella? Honestly, no. I’m not a medical professional, you know. I just want to make sure everything inside is working properly, and that any baby will be… healthy. Are these tests going to tell me that? And how long will all of this take? I haven't got all day. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and I apologize for using those terms without explaining. Those are just common childhood illnesses – rubella is German measles, and varicella is chickenpox. If you haven’t had them, or aren't immune, it’s important to get vaccinated before getting pregnant, as they can cause serious problems for the baby. The blood work will also give us an idea of your overall health and whether there might be any underlying issues that need to be addressed. Yes, these tests will help us determine if your body is prepared for a pregnancy and to assess the likelihood of a healthy baby. The physical exam itself will take about 15-20 minutes. The blood work will take another 10 minutes or so to draw, and then the lab typically takes a few days to get the results back – usually 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Three to five days? That’s ridiculous. Absolutely not. Is there nothing quicker? Can’t you just… speed things up? I don’t have time to sit around waiting for results. I need to know now. Fine. If that's the fastest it can be done, do it, I suppose. But I expect you to be very efficient with the rest of this. No unnecessary chatting, and get me in and out as quickly as possible. And tell me, if everything is… perfect, what are the chances of actually getting pregnant at my age? Be realistic, please. I don’t want false hope.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Angelle, and I will absolutely be as efficient as possible. Unfortunately, lab turnaround times are largely out of my control, and 3-5 business days is standard for these tests. I can certainly prioritize the request with the lab to see if they can expedite things, but I can’t guarantee a faster result. As for your chances of getting pregnant at age 51… it is more challenging, and the chances are lower than with younger women. A woman’s fertility declines significantly with age, and there’s a higher risk of complications like miscarriage and chromosomal abnormalities. However, it's absolutely possible to get pregnant at 51, especially with assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization . The success rate depends on many individual factors, including your overall health, ovarian function, and whether you’re using IVF. On average, the live birth rate for women 50-54 using IVF is around 1-5% per cycle. Before we discuss further options, let's proceed with the initial blood work and physical exam. This will give us a clearer picture of your current status and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: One to five percent? That’s… discouraging, to say the least. Honestly, I expected better. Fine. Let’s just get the tests done. I suppose I don't have much choice. But if it turns out to be a waste of time – and it sounds like it will be – I expect a full refund for everything. And quickly. No haggling. Where do we start? Just tell me what you need me to do. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Angelle, and I want to assure you that we'll gather all the necessary information to make an informed decision. I’ll document your expectation regarding a potential refund. Let’s start with the physical exam. If you don’t mind, please have a seat here. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and weight. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also want to ask you a few questions about your medical history, any medications you’re taking, and your lifestyle. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And please, no unnecessary chatting. I have things to do. I’ll sit. Let’s hurry.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and weight is 86 kilograms. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much. Just a little something for my arthritis. It’s nothing serious. Ibuprofen, when I need it. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last year. I don’t take anything else. I try to stay healthy. And I assure you, I haven’t been drinking or smoking, if that's what you’re going to ask. I’m a sensible woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Angelle. That’s helpful. And I appreciate you telling me that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. I'm not a fussy eater, you know. Just get on with it, please. I haven't got all day. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to ask a few questions about your menstrual cycle – if you’re still experiencing periods. When was your last period, and are your cycles regular?
PATIENT: Honestly? That’s a personal question. And frankly, irrelevant. I haven’t had a proper period in years. It’s… irregular, to say the least. Mostly stopped altogether. I’m 51, you know. These things happen. And I really don’t see why it matters if I’m trying to… get pregnant. It’s the inside that matters, not when my… cycle happens. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just wasting time?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, and I apologize for asking an insensitive question. Knowing that your periods have stopped is important information. It indicates that you may be experiencing menopause, which affects your ovarian function and fertility. Now, could you tell me about any previous surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Just the C-section I told you about. Years ago. A very long time ago. And honestly, I don't remember all the details. It was traumatic, to say the least. They had to… well, never mind. Just the C-section. Is that enough? Are we almost done? I have a very important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. Thank you. Finally, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure. And my father… he had heart problems. That’s about it, really. No major illnesses. No history of genetic disorders. A perfectly normal family, as far as I know. And honestly, I doubt it makes any difference. I’m a sensible woman, I take care of myself. Is that enough? Can we finally get the tests done? I’m wasting precious time here.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Angelle. Thank you for your patience. Alright, we've covered the important points. Now, I’ll need to draw some blood for the tests we discussed. I'll also give you a referral slip for a pelvic ultrasound, which will give us a better look at your uterus and ovaries. Please have a seat here, and I’ll be right back with the supplies. It will only take a few minutes. Is there anything you need before we proceed?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. And please, be gentle. I don't like needles. And make sure it’s the fastest possible method. I have a very important appointment later, and I can't afford to waste any more time. Just hurry, please. And don't talk to me unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Angelle. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please relax your arm. This may sting for a moment, but it will be over soon. Okay, all done. Please apply pressure to the site for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Here’s a bandage. And here’s the referral slip for the ultrasound. They’ll schedule an appointment for you when you call. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. Just… when will I get the results? And what happens then? Don’t tell me it’s going to be another week. I haven’t got all day, you know. And tell me again, clearly, what a low chance of success actually means. Be realistic. I want to know if this is a complete waste of time. And quickly.
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to process the results, but I'll prioritize the request and see if they can expedite it. I'll call you as soon as I have them. As for what a low chance of success means… a 1-5% live birth rate per cycle means that for every 100 cycles of attempting pregnancy, only 1-5 women will result in a live birth. It’s important to understand that these rates are averages, and your individual chances may be higher or lower depending on your specific circumstances. Factors like your overall health, ovarian function, and the quality of the sperm will all play a role. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a complete waste of time. It just means that assisted reproductive technologies like IVF may be necessary to increase your chances of success. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the results, and you can decide what’s best for you. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… call me when you have the results. Don’t waste my time. And please, be thorough. I want all the facts, clearly and concisely. No medical jargon. And don’t try to sell me anything. I'm a sensible woman, I can make my own decisions. Just give me the facts. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have an appointment to get to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. I will ensure you receive a thorough and clear explanation of the results. Have a good day, and I will be in touch as soon as they are available. .
