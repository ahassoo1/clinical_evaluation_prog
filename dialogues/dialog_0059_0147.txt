DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It’s a bit concerning, and that's why I scheduled an appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump in the lower abdomen is certainly something we should investigate. To help me get a better understanding, could you describe the lump for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…firm, not squishy. About the size of a plum, maybe a little smaller. It doesn’t really hurt, not constantly anyway. Sometimes I feel a dull ache, but it comes and goes. It’s…lower down, towards my right side, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed it getting much bigger recently, but it’s definitely been there for a while now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Raghunathan. That’s very helpful. And you said it's been present for a while – can you recall approximately how long?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. I'd say…at least a couple of months, maybe three? It started very small, and I initially dismissed it as just…something temporary. But it hasn’t gone away, and it hasn’t gotten smaller, so I decided it was time to get it checked.
DOCTOR: That’s wise of you to come in and have it evaluated. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes, actually. I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, just generally run down. And my appetite hasn’t been great. Nothing major, but I haven’t been as hungry as I normally am. Oh, and…I’ve been going to the bathroom more frequently, but no pain or anything like that. Just…more often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all helpful information, thank you. Increased frequency of urination, fatigue, and decreased appetite... We'll want to explore those further. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm generally quite healthy. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, things like that, but nothing serious. My family… my father had high blood pressure, and my mother had some arthritis, but that’s about it. I've never been diagnosed with anything chronic, and I don’t take any regular medications. I do have Medicare, as I’m retired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant past medical history or medications. And you mentioned your parents' health conditions - high blood pressure and arthritis. Are you aware of any other relevant family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. My aunt, on my mother’s side, had some issues with her stomach a few years back. They never really said what it was exactly, something about needing to monitor it, but she’s doing alright now, as far as I know. Other than that…no, not really. No history of cancer, or anything like that. We aren't a particularly sickly family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. No allergies at all, as far as I'm aware. I’ve always been able to eat and take pretty much anything without any issues. It’s one less thing to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That is good news. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm retired now, so I don’t have a stressful job anymore. I try to stay active. I enjoy gardening, and I go for walks most days, weather permitting, of course. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I eat a fairly balanced diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. Nothing too exciting, really. Just a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, Mr. Raghunathan. Alright, with your permission, I'd like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and gently feeling for the lump you described, and checking a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. I am palpating your abdomen now. I do feel a firm mass in your lower right quadrant, approximately the size you described - around 5 centimeters. It doesn't appear particularly tender to the touch, but it is fixed – meaning it doesn’t move easily when I press. Your bowel sounds are normal, and I don’t detect any significant guarding or rigidity. I'm also noting some mild discomfort when I press in the area around the mass, but it doesn’t seem acute. I am going to check your vital signs now as well, just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That all sounds… thorough. I appreciate you explaining what you’re doing. I hadn’t noticed much pain, so that’s good to know it's not acute. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything. Is checking my vital signs just my blood pressure and pulse?
DOCTOR: Yes, checking your vital signs includes your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. Given your history and the findings of the physical examination, I think it’s important to order some further investigations to determine the cause of this mass. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal CT scan. The CT scan will give us a detailed image of your abdomen and help us to identify the nature of the mass. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. A CT scan and blood work seem like the best way to figure out what’s going on. Please, proceed with those tests. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the CT scan? Do I need to fast, or drink anything beforehand? And when can I expect the results? I’m a little anxious, naturally, but I’m glad we’re taking steps to find out what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Raghunathan, and it’s perfectly natural to feel that way. For the CT scan, you will need to fast for at least six hours beforehand. You can drink clear liquids, like water, up until a few hours before the appointment. I will provide you with a detailed information sheet with specific instructions when you leave. The radiology department will schedule the scan for you. Typically, we receive the results within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have the results, I will contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's very clear. Fast for six hours, clear liquids okay, and results in 24-48 hours. And to watch out for severe pain, fever, or nausea. I think I’ve got it. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your calm demeanor; it’s very reassuring. I’m ready for the information sheet now, if you have it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. Here is the information sheet. It includes contact information for the radiology department if you have any questions about scheduling the scan. I’ll also have my nurse prepare a work note for your records. Do you anticipate needing any assistance with transportation or accommodations for the scan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you for offering. I’m all set for transportation; my son will be taking me. And I don’t anticipate needing any accommodations. I'm quite independent. I think that's everything. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I feel much better having spoken with you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or experience any changes in your condition. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Raghunathan, and please give my best to your son.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And you have a good day as well.
