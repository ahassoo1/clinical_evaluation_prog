DOCTOR: Hi Laury, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I want… I want to know more about where my family come from. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do testing, with… with spit? To see who I am, inside?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestry, your family history from a long time ago, and you’ve heard about genetic testing that uses a saliva sample?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. My mother, she tell stories. Stories of islands, and boats, and… and different people. But stories change, you know? Old man like me, I forget things. I want to know for sure. Before I… before I can’t remember anything anymore. Is that… is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's absolutely possible. Genetic ancestry testing has become quite popular, and it can often provide a lot of information about where your ancestors likely came from. It won't give you every detail, and stories are always important too, but it can be a good starting point. It sounds like those stories from your mother are really important to you, and wanting to preserve that knowledge is a wonderful reason to look into this. Let me just quickly look over your chart here… I see you’re 85 years young and originally from the Marshall Islands, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Marshall Islands. Majuro. I live here now, but I born there. Long, long ago. Majuro is a small island, you know? Lots of water. Lots of family still there, I think. Hard to keep track now. Old age… it makes things blurry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely normal for things to feel a bit blurry as we get older. Majuro is beautiful, I've read about it. Okay, good to know. So, this ancestry testing… it works by analyzing your DNA. It can tell you about your ethnic origins – which regions your ancestors likely came from. There are a few different companies that offer these tests. Some are more detailed than others, and they vary in price. Have you thought about which company you might want to use, or would you like me to give you some information on a few of the reputable options?
PATIENT: Reputable? What that mean? I don’t know any companies. I just… I just hear about the spit test. And I thought… you people here, you know about this stuff. Which one is… safest? And… and cheapest? I don’t have much money. Medicare… it don’t cover this, right?
DOCTOR: "Reputable" just means trustworthy, a company that’s known for being accurate and protecting your privacy. It's important, because these tests give you personal information. You’re right to ask about safety and cost. Let's talk about that. Here, I have a list of a few companies that are generally considered reliable: 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage DNA. They all work pretty similarly – you order a kit online, spit into a tube, mail it back, and they send you the results in a few weeks. 23andMe tends to be a little more focused on health information along with ancestry, which can be helpful, but it's also a bit more expensive. AncestryDNA is really good if you're also interested in building a family tree – they have a huge database of records. MyHeritage is similar, and often has sales. Right now, MyHeritage is probably the cheapest option, with tests starting around $79. 23andMe is usually around $99-$199, and AncestryDNA is a bit more, around $149-$199. You're also right to ask about Medicare. Unfortunately, Medicare typically doesn't cover genetic ancestry testing, as it’s considered an elective test, not a medical necessity. Would you like me to go into more detail about any of these companies, or maybe we can talk about what you hope to learn from the test, and I can help you pick the best option?
PATIENT: Seventy-nine dollars… that’s… that’s a lot of rice. But… maybe. I don’t care about the health stuff. Just where my family come from. Before the boats, before the islands… before everything. I just want to know… who I am. Is that silly? My mother, she say we come from… from the stars. But that’s just a story, right? I just want… proof. If that’s possible. What does MyHeritage… what do they tell you? Do they tell you where? Like… what islands?
DOCTOR: No, that's not silly at all. Wanting to understand your roots and who you are is a very important thing. It’s perfectly natural to want “proof”, and these tests can often provide that, at least a good starting point. MyHeritage focuses on ethnicity estimates. They break it down into different regions – they'll tell you percentages for things like Polynesian, Melanesian, East Asian, and so on. Within those broader categories, they can often narrow it down further. For example, they might tell you something like “40% Polynesian .” They can identify specific island groups, but it’s not always exact. It depends on how much data they have from that region. They also have a database of historical records, which can sometimes help you trace your family tree, but that’s a separate feature, and usually requires a subscription. It’s important to remember that these tests are estimates, based on comparisons to existing DNA samples. They're not 100% accurate, and the results can sometimes vary depending on the company. But they can often give you a good idea of your ancestral origins. Do you think that sounds like something that would be helpful for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… Marquesas Islands… I think my mother talk about that. Maybe. Forty percent… that’s a lot. And I like that you say it’s not exact. Stories are not exact either. Okay. I think… I think I want to try MyHeritage. But… can you… can you help me order it? I not so good with computers. And I worried about… about sending my spit to strangers. Is that safe? Will they… will they keep my secrets?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’m happy to help you order it. That’s what I’m here for. And you're very smart to ask about the safety and privacy – it's a very important concern. MyHeritage has pretty strict privacy policies. They state that they don’t share your DNA data with third parties without your explicit consent, and they use secure methods to store and protect your information. They also allow you to control who can see your results. You can choose to keep them completely private, or share them with family members if you want. You can read their full privacy policy here if you’d like. They’re also HIPAA compliant, which means they follow strict regulations to protect your health information. Now, let’s get you signed up. First, we’ll need to create an account with your email address and a password… Is it okay if I use your email address from your chart here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. My email… it’s lauryscobie@email.com. I don’t get many emails. Mostly… mostly just reminders from the doctor. And… and pictures from my niece. She live in Hawaii now. Hawaii is nice. I visit once. Long time ago. Before… before everything. Now, just stories.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. lauryscobie@email.com… And now we need to create a password. It needs to be at least eight characters long, and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Do you want me to help you come up with one?
PATIENT: Oh… symbols? I don’t know any symbols. Just… letters and numbers. My birthday? Is that okay? August fifteenth, 1938. 8151938. Is that safe? Too easy? Everyone knows my birthday.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious. Using your birthday is probably not the best idea, since it's easy for others to guess. It's better to use a combination of random letters, numbers, and symbols. How about “Starfish23!”?
PATIENT: Starfish… I like starfish. My mother, she make necklaces from starfish. And 23… that’s my niece’s lucky number. Yes. Starfish23! That’s good. That’s safe. Thank you. You very good with computers. I worry too much. Old man things.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. It’s perfectly normal to be cautious, especially when it comes to your personal information. That's my job, to help you with these things. Okay, now we just need to select the DNA ancestry test kit. There are a few different options, but the basic ancestry kit is probably the best choice for you. It costs $79 and provides a detailed ethnicity estimate. Do you want me to add that to your cart?
PATIENT: Seventy-nine dollars… one last time. Yes. Add it to the cart. Just… get it done. I want to know. I want to know who I am. Before I forget everything. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury. And you don’t have to thank me. It’s my pleasure to help. Okay, now I just need to enter your shipping address and payment information. Is your address still 123 Main Street here in town?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 123 Main Street. Small apartment. Not much room. But… it’s quiet. And… my credit card? I not so good with credit cards. I have a card from the bank. But… I don’t like to give it to strangers. Is this safe? Everything is so complicated now.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, and it's wise to be careful. This website uses a secure payment system, which encrypts your credit card information to protect it from fraud. You can also rest assured that I won’t have access to your full credit card number. See this padlock icon?
PATIENT: Padlock… yes. I see. What that mean? Like a safe? Everything is so… digital now. My mother, she keep her treasures in a wooden box. Under the bed. Safe and sound. Okay. Fine. Wooden box is better. But… I trust you, Doctor. You very kind. Just… hurry. My hands are shaking.
DOCTOR: You’re right, a wooden box is very safe. But I assure you, your information is protected here as well. And we’re almost done. Just a few more clicks. Okay, the order is placed! You should receive a confirmation email within a few minutes. The DNA test kit will be shipped to your address within 5-7 business days. Here’s the order confirmation. It includes the shipping address and estimated delivery date. You did it! It was a little complicated, but you got through it. And now you’ll be one step closer to learning about your ancestry. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You very patient. And… and kind. I feel… a little bit lighter now. Like a weight has been lifted. Maybe… maybe my mother was right. Maybe we do come from the stars. Now… I have a chance to find out. Thank you again. You very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury. It was my pleasure. And I agree, your mother might be right. It’s wonderful that you’re taking this step to explore your heritage. If you have any questions or concerns once you receive the test kit, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Have a wonderful day, Laury. And I look forward to hearing about your results!
