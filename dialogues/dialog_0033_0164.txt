DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Haggar, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, well, it’s been a bit strange, actually. A few times now, after I eat fava beans – you know, those big green beans? – I get really, really tired. And yellow. My skin gets yellow, and my eyes too, I think. It’s… worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Tired and yellow… after fava beans. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the first time, maybe six months ago? But it didn't happen again for a while. Then it happened twice in the last month. Each time, after eating fava beans. It's not every time I eat them, but enough to make me nervous. I haven’t changed anything else in my diet, or… anything really.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, intermittent… interesting. And how much would you say you typically eat when this occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, not a huge amount! Maybe… a cup of them? Cooked, usually. I like them with a little olive oil and some feta cheese. It’s a traditional Romanian dish, you see. Not a whole plateful, definitely not. Just a normal side dish, I would say.
DOCTOR: A cup… Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and yellowing?
PATIENT: Um… well, now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a little weak, like I might faint. And my tummy… it gets a bit upset. Not full-on sick, just… uncomfortable. And I’ve been a bit breathless sometimes, but I thought that was just the heat, honestly. It’s been very hot lately.
DOCTOR: Weakness, discomfort…breathlessness. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the low side, but within acceptable parameters. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let me check your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit… right there, on my left side. Not terrible, just… sensitive. It’s probably just because I ate a bit much last night, honestly. But yes, a little tender. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And your sclera… yes, there is a slight jaundice present. Not severe, but noticeable. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and also a reticulocyte count. We need to check your liver function and rule out some possibilities. Also, a G6PD deficiency test.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those tests… What are you checking for, exactly? I’m… a little scared now. Is it something bad? And what is a… G6PD thing?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Haggar, please try to remain calm. A G6PD deficiency is an enzyme deficiency that can cause hemolytic anemia, meaning your red blood cells break down. It can be triggered by certain foods – like fava beans – or medications. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It’s likely nothing serious, but we need to rule things out. We'll get the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to avoid fava beans completely.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that makes… a little sense. Avoiding fava beans, definitely. That's… manageable. Hemolytic anemia… that sounds scary though. So, the fava beans could be causing this? And you think it's likely that’s what’s happening? I just… I’ve always eaten them, my whole life.
DOCTOR: It could be. Or it could be something else entirely. That’s why we’re running tests. Don't jump to conclusions. And frankly, Mrs. Haggar, some people are simply more susceptible to certain things. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is fundamentally wrong. I'm ordering the tests, and we will discuss the results when they come back. For now, avoid fava beans and try not to worry unnecessarily. Do you have any other concerns, or shall we consider this consultation concluded?
PATIENT: Oh… um… No, I think that’s everything. Just… avoiding fava beans, and waiting for the results. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let's hope so. The lab will contact you with the results. Have a good day, Mrs. Haggar.
