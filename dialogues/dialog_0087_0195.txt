DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Doctor…Soodeen, was it? Yes, well, it’s not a real problem, you understand. Just…my sister, she always gets these lovely cards when she's feeling a little under the weather. All flowery and encouraging. And I thought, well, a nice card from a real doctor might cheer things up a bit. It’s just…a little boost, you know? Not that I’m sick sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. While I'm happy to provide a note for your sister, as a physician my primary role is to address health concerns. Even if you feel it’s not a “real problem,” it’s important to rule out anything serious. Perhaps you could tell me a little more about what’s been going on that makes you feel like you might need…a boost?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It's just…life. You know? Getting older. Things ache a bit more. I tire easily. My husband, bless his heart, he says I complain too much. He doesn't understand. It’s not like I have a fever or anything. And I’m still working, still assembling these little…gadgets at the factory. It’s just…a general feeling of being…blah. Is that enough for a card? Really, I just want a nice card. A pretty one. With maybe some birds on it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Micucci. And yes, that is enough for us to talk. Even “general feeling of being blah” can indicate something that needs attention. It's good that you're still working, that's excellent. Let's try to be a little more specific, if you don't mind. When did you start noticing this feeling of tiredness and aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… Well, let me think. It’s not like it was sudden. It’s been…gradual. Probably…since the monsoon season ended last year? Yes, last year. It’s always worse during the humidity, you know? Makes everything feel heavier. And then the winter, it’s cold and damp. And now this heat… it just never ends. So, maybe… eight, nine months? Something like that. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. I don’t keep a calendar of my aches and pains, Doctor. That’s just silly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal not to keep track of those things. Eight to nine months… so this has been ongoing for a while. Besides the tiredness and aches, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn't what it used to be. I used to love dal bhat, you know? Now, I just…pick at it. My husband keeps making me these big plates and I just can't finish them. He worries, naturally. And I sleep… well, I sleep okay, but I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s like I haven’t slept at all. And… oh! My hands. They’ve been feeling a little stiff lately. Especially in the mornings. Makes it harder to assemble the…the bits and bobs at work. It’s annoying, really. Is that enough for a card now? Because honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm giving you my life story.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Micucci, you are not giving me your life story. This is important information. Loss of appetite, unrefreshing sleep, and stiffness in your hands… those are all things we need to consider. Just to clarify, the stiffness is in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, yes. Both hands. It's worse in the mornings, like I said. And it doesn’t go away completely during the day, it just… lessens. It’s not like I can’t work, I just have to… concentrate harder. And sometimes I drop things. Small things. Screws and…and those little plastic connectors. My supervisor hasn’t said anything yet, but I can tell she’s watching me. Honestly, it’s probably just old age. Everyone gets stiff when they get older, don’t they? I’m just being a bother. Can we please talk about the card now? A nice, colourful one, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, it's understandable you'd like to focus on the card, but these symptoms – the fatigue, loss of appetite, unrefreshing sleep, and hand stiffness – warrant further investigation. While it could be simply related to aging, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I want to ensure you're healthy and feel your best. Before we discuss a card, I’d like to ask a few more questions and then do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Physical exam? Really? I came here for a card, Doctor. Not to be poked and prodded. I’m telling you, it’s just… life. Getting older. Everyone feels a bit blah sometimes. I don’t need a whole examination. And frankly, I don’t have time for it. My husband will be wondering where I am. I just want a little encouragement, a little pick-me-up. Is that too much to ask? I swear, doctors these days… You want to fix everything instead of just listening. Honestly, I think I'll just go home. It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m not meeting your expectations. My intention isn’t to dismiss your feelings, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and wellbeing. Even if it is simply related to aging, a quick exam can help rule out other potential causes and give me a better understanding of what's going on. I assure you, it won’t be extensive. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your hands and joints. It will only take a few minutes. And if everything checks out, we can absolutely discuss a card. However, if you are truly not comfortable with an exam, I respect your decision. But please understand that I cannot provide a medical opinion or documentation without gathering some basic information. In that case, I would recommend seeing a specialist for a thorough evaluation. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But make it quick. And gentle. I don’t like being touched. And please, no asking me to say "ahhh". Really. Just…get it over with. But I'm still expecting that card afterwards. And it better be a pretty one, with birds. Not flowers. Birds. Do you understand? Birds.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Micucci, I understand. Birds. Absolutely. No flowers. And I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Hurry up, then. It feels strange having that thing on my arm. And try not to squeeze it too tight, alright? I bruise easily. Honestly, doctors these days…always poking and prodding. It's a wonder anyone feels normal after a visit.
DOCTOR: I’m being as careful as possible, Ms. Micucci. Just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me, please?
PATIENT: It sounds all… wheezy, doesn't it? That’s probably the humidity. Everything feels congested in this weather. And it’s always worse indoors with the air conditioning. Honestly, I prefer just being outside, even if it’s hot and sticky. At least you can breathe properly. Are you writing all this down? It sounds very serious.
DOCTOR: I am making notes, Ms. Micucci, but it's standard procedure. Your breathing sounds a little congested, as you said, which is not uncommon with the humidity. It’s not significantly concerning at this point. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s stiff, alright? That's why I came here. It aches when I move them. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like little needles are poking me. My husband says it’s just arthritis. He always thinks the worst. But I don't want to take any of those pills. They make me feel… foggy. And I need to be sharp, you know? I have to assemble these gadgets at work. It requires concentration. Honestly, it’s just a bother. Can we please talk about the card now? I'm starting to feel like I’ve wasted a whole morning.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s some mild tenderness in the joints, particularly in your knuckles. The range of motion is slightly reduced, but not severely. The “needle-like” sensation you describe is consistent with some nerve irritation, which could be related to the joint inflammation or other factors. Okay, Ms. Micucci. I’ve completed the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and my findings, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms without further investigation. It could be early signs of arthritis, as your husband suggested, but other possibilities need to be ruled out. Before we talk about a card, I want to discuss some potential next steps. I recommend getting some blood work to check for inflammation markers and rule out other conditions. I can also order some X-rays of your hands to assess the joints more closely. And yes, we will discuss a card, but I want to ensure your health is addressed first. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? Oh, for goodness sake. That sounds awful. I knew it. I knew it would be something complicated. Honestly, Doctor, I came here for a card, not a whole medical investigation. I just want a little encouragement, a little pick-me-up. I don't want to be poked and prodded and worried about all sorts of things. No. Absolutely not. No blood work. No X-rays. I’m not doing any of that. Just…give me the card. A pretty one with birds. And let me go home. I’m starting to feel quite stressed out now, and stress isn’t good for my…well, everything. I think I’ve had enough of this for one day. Honestly, some doctors these days… they just want to make everything more complicated. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Micucci. I respect your decision. Since you are declining any further testing, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or medical advice. However, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms. If they worsen or you develop new concerns, please seek medical attention. Here you are. I hope this brings you a little cheer. I wish you all the best, Ms. Micucci. .
