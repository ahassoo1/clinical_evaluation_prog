DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Let me see… well, it’s a bit silly, really. My son, he worries so. He says I should know my… what does he call it… blood type? Yes, that’s it. He wants me to know my blood type, just in case. I don’t rightly remember ever having it checked. Is that something you can do here?
DOCTOR: Your blood type. Right. Well, it’s not exactly silly, Ms. Nini, though it’s certainly not usually a pressing medical concern unless you’re needing a transfusion. Your son is… conscientious. Yes, we can absolutely check that for you. It’s a simple blood draw. But before we go ahead and do that, is there anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, nothing else at all. Just the blood type. My son, Miguel, he's a good boy. Always fussing. He says with my age… well, you know. Things come up. I suppose he’s right. A simple blood draw, you say? That doesn’t sound too bad. Do you need a lot? I’m not very good with needles, if I’m honest. Not afraid, exactly, just… not fond of them.
DOCTOR: It's a standard amount, Ms. Nini, just a few vials. We have very experienced phlebotomists, they're quite gentle. It'll be a quick pinch, and then it's done. Before we proceed, though, let’s just run through a quick medical history to get a better overall picture. It’s good practice, even for something as straightforward as this. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A history, you say? Let me think… I used to see Dr. Ramirez, back in… oh, I don't know, a long time ago. He retired, I think. And then… well, I haven't really needed a doctor, you see? Just the usual aches and pains. Old age, I suppose. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone regularly for… oh, must be ten years, at least. Maybe longer. I take a little something for my… well, for my water. Helps me sleep. That's all. Is that enough history? I'm terrible with dates, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. "A little something for your water," you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… now you’re asking me! It’s a little blue pill. Small. My daughter-in-law, Isabella, she gets it for me. She knows all the names. I just take it before bed. It helps me… well, it makes me go to the bathroom less during the night. That’s all I know about it, truly. I haven’t a clue what it’s called. Should I know? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I apologize.
DOCTOR: It's rather important to know what medications you're taking, Ms. Nini, even if it's just a "little blue pill." Let me see if I can pull up your records here… Do you happen to know the name of your pharmacy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pharmacy… hmm. Isabella uses the one… near the supermarket? The big one, with the drive-through. It's… Walgreens, I think? Yes, Walgreens. On Main Street. She always goes there. I really rely on her for these things, you see. I get so confused with names and places. I'm sorry to be such a bother. Perhaps she could call and tell you? She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. I’m showing a few prescriptions filled at the Walgreens on Main Street. Let me see… yes, here we are. You've been prescribed Tamsulosin. It's used to treat an enlarged prostate… which, of course, women don't have. Are you sure Isabella isn't filling this prescription for someone else?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness! Tamsulosin? Well, that is odd. My son, Miguel, he has… problems, you see. With his… water. Yes, that must be it! He must have given me one of his pills by mistake! He's always mixing things up. I told him not to leave his medicine lying around. He gets so flustered, that boy. So, it's his pill, not mine? Oh, dear, what a mess! I apologize again for all the confusion. Is it safe for me to have taken one? Just the one, I promise.
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, Ms. Nini. Tamsulosin can cause dizziness and lightheadedness, especially in women. It's best to avoid taking medication that isn't specifically prescribed to you. We'll monitor your blood pressure and I'll ask a few questions just to be safe. But frankly, relying on your son for medication management is… not advisable. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dizziness, you say? Well, I haven't felt too dizzy, just a little… unsteady. I put it down to my age, you see. I suppose I should be more careful. I will definitely tell Miguel to keep his pills separate from now on. He means well, that boy. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long, long time ago. I haven't been stung in decades. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. Though Isabella does get upset with me about eating too much chocolate. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nini, a fondness for chocolate doesn’t count as an allergy. Alright. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes! I had my tonsils out when I was a girl. And… and I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. That was a silly thing to do. And… oh, goodness, I think I had a… a little thing removed from my face. A mole, I think? It was years ago. A very nice doctor did it. I can’t remember his name, though. It was a small surgery. Nothing major. Just a little snip, I think. Does that help? My memory is just terrible, you see. I'm afraid I’m not a very good patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Tonsils, a broken arm, and a mole removal. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… goodness. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, I think. Ninety-something, perhaps? She had… aches and pains, like me. And my father… he was a strong man, but he had… problems with his heart, I think. I don’t rightly remember. It was a long time ago. My brother… he had… something with his stomach, but I don’t know what. Everyone always just got… sick, you see? Nothing specific that I can recall. We weren't one for talking about these things much. Is that useful? I wish I could be more help. It’s just… so long ago.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, with all due respect, this is becoming difficult. We need to establish a clear medical background. Do you understand why it’s important for me to know this information?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Am I doing something wrong? I’m trying my best, you see. I just… I don’t have a good memory. Things fade. It's like trying to hold water in my hands. It slips away. I understand it’s important, but it’s hard to remember all these things. I just wanted to know my blood type, so Miguel wouldn't worry so much. Is that so much to ask? I apologize if I'm being a bother. Perhaps I should just forget about the blood type? It’s probably not that important after all. I’m sorry to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, it’s alright. It’s clear you’re not intentionally being difficult. And you’re right, knowing your blood type isn’t a medical emergency. However, it’s important for me to gather as much information as possible, even if it seems trivial. It helps me understand your overall health and provide the best possible care. Perhaps we can focus on what is bothering you currently. Besides wanting to know your blood type, are you experiencing any other symptoms—anything at all—like fatigue, weight loss, pain, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to say, dear. No, not really. I feel… a bit tired, sometimes. Old age, you see. And I do get a bit… forgetful, as you’ve noticed. But nothing that worries me. I eat alright, I think. Perhaps a little too much chocolate, as Isabella says. No pain, no weight loss… just the usual aches and pains. And the tiredness. It’s just… being old, I suppose. I really don’t think there’s anything wrong. I appreciate you trying, though. Perhaps we should just get this blood type checked, and then I can go home and rest. That sounds lovely, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. We will proceed with the blood draw to determine your blood type. After that, I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just as a precaution. Then, if everything checks out, you can go home and rest. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds lovely, dear. Thank you so much. Blood pressure, heart and lungs… alright. Anything to put Miguel’s mind at ease. He worries so. Is it going to hurt much? I do hope it’s quick. And do you think… do you think you’ll be able to tell me my blood type right away? I just want to know it’s alright. And then I can go home and have a nice cup of tea. That sounds perfect.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick pinch, Ms. Nini, I promise. And yes, we should have the results back relatively quickly. I’ll let you know as soon as we have them. Now, if you’ll just follow me, we’ll get the blood draw done. And then we can check your vitals.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Lead the way. I’m ready, I think. Though I must confess, I do feel a bit… fluttery. Old age, you see. It does strange things to one’s nerves. I do hope it’s not too bad. And thank you again for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: It's quite alright, Ms. Nini. It’s all very routine. We'll have you seated comfortably, and the phlebotomist will take it from there. Just try to relax. Here we are. She knocks gently on the door. "Maria, we have a patient for a blood draw."
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. I’ll try. Relax, you say? It’s easier said than done, at my age. Is it… is it a young man? I don’t like young men poking about with needles. No offense, of course. It’s just… they’re so clumsy. Is there a nice woman who can do it?
DOCTOR: It’s Maria, she’s a very experienced phlebotomist, and she’s excellent. She’s a woman, Ms. Nini. Don’t worry. Maria, this is Ms. Nini. She's here for a routine blood draw. Please take good care of her.
PATIENT: Oh, a woman! That's a relief, dear. Thank you so much. Hello, dear. You look very capable. I do hope it doesn't hurt too much. And please, take your time. I bruise easily, you see. Old age, again. It’s a terrible thing, this aging business.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. It’s lovely to meet you. Don’t worry, I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll make sure to take my time. I have plenty of experience with patients who bruise easily. Just a little pinch, that’s all. And we’ll have you all done in a jiffy. Now, if you could just extend your arm…
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. A little pinch, you say? Just get it over with quickly, please. I don’t like dwelling on these things. And try not to poke too deep, if you could. It’s a terrible thing, needles. Absolutely terrible. I used to faint at the sight of them, you know. Though I haven’t fainted in years. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Just relax your arm for me. I've found a good vein. It will be very quick, I promise. Just a little prick. There you go. All done. Just a little pressure here… Hold that firmly for a few minutes. And try to keep your arm still.
PATIENT: Oh! That was quick. You were right, dear. Just a little pinch. I hardly felt a thing. You have a very steady hand. Thank you so much. You’re a marvel, truly. Now, what happens next? Will you tell me my blood type right away? I’m ever so curious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Nini. I'm glad it wasn't too bad. The blood sample will be sent to the lab, and it usually takes about ten to fifteen minutes to get the results back. Dr. Nooruddin will review them as soon as they're available. Why don't you go back to the examination room, and I'll let the doctor know you're ready. She’ll come in and discuss the results with you as soon as they're back. I'll just go let her know.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Ten to fifteen minutes, you say? That doesn't sound too long. Thank you again for being so kind. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’m ever so curious to know my blood type. I do hope it’s a good one. Perhaps Dr. Nooruddin will have some nice tea waiting for me? That would be lovely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. I hope you have a lovely time, and I’m sure Dr. Nooruddin will be with you shortly.
