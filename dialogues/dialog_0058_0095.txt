DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane Nissenbaum, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get on with it… I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Right. Well, sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are concerning. Let’s not minimize it, even if it is disrupting your schedule. How long ago did this start exactly?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. Woke up, went to make tea, and… nothing on the left side. And my mouth feels… off. Like I’m trying to smile with only half a face. It started this morning. Before that, everything was perfectly normal. Do you need a detailed timeline down to the minute? Because frankly, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little more detail would be helpful. “This morning” isn’t terribly precise. Was it immediately upon waking, or did it develop over the first hour or so?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. I woke up, and it was just… there. I didn’t sit there cataloging the exact moment my hearing disappeared. I noticed it when I tried to listen to the news while making tea, and it wasn't working. It wasn't a gradual thing, if that’s what you're getting at. It just was. Really, I expect more professionalism and less… interrogation, from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Professionalism requires me to gather a complete history, Stephane. Sudden onset of these symptoms is… significant. And frankly, your dismissive attitude isn’t helping me assess the situation. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No fever, no headache. Taste is… normal, I suppose. Though everything tastes a bit bland now that I can’t hear the sizzle of my food. Is that a symptom? Look, I’m not a doctor. I just woke up with half my face paralyzed and I can't hear! What more do you want to know? I’m a busy woman, and I don’t appreciate being made to feel like I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any dizziness or problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Perfectly steady, thank you. I walk perfectly well. Though, admittedly, I’m a little more cautious now, given that I can’t hear someone coming up behind me. It’s rather unsettling. But no, balance is fine. This is all quite simple, isn't it? I lost hearing and half my face doesn't work. I'm starting to wonder why this is taking so long.
DOCTOR: Simple?
PATIENT: Yes, simple! It's not like I'm describing a complex medical condition. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness. It's… obvious. I'd think you'd have seen this before. Are you new? No offense. But honestly, it feels like you're deliberately trying to prolong this.
DOCTOR: I've been practicing medicine for quite some time, thank you very much. And while the symptoms sound straightforward, the cause is not. We need to rule out several possibilities. Before we proceed, have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No! Never. As I've said repeatedly, this is a new development. I've been perfectly healthy my entire life, aside from the usual aches and pains of getting older. I eat well, I exercise, I don't smoke… Frankly, I'm a very responsible person. This is just… terribly inconvenient and disruptive. It’s hardly something one plans for. Are you going to actually do something or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a look at your ear. And then I'm going to need to do a quick neurological exam. It's standard procedure, Stephane, and it's necessary to determine the likely cause of your symptoms. Please remain still.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to poke anything too hard. And be quick about it. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. Though at this rate, I doubt I’ll be going. This is just… appalling. Really, appalling service.
DOCTOR: Alright. External auditory canal appears clear. Now, close your eyes. Can you furrow your brow?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. It doesn’t feel right. It’s harder on this side. As you can see. Not exactly a smooth operation, is it? Do you need me to demonstrate this repeatedly? It’s quite obvious.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. And puff out your cheeks. Now, try to smile. Keep smiling. Alright. Given your symptoms and the neurological findings, the most likely possibility is Bell’s palsy. However, we need to rule out other, more serious causes, such as a stroke.
PATIENT: Stroke?! Are you saying… I could be having a stroke? You didn't mention anything about strokes before! This is… unacceptable. Why didn't you say something sooner?! I have a perfectly good life! I need to know what’s going on now. Are you going to give me a scan or what? I demand a scan! A proper investigation! This is simply outrageous!
DOCTOR: I said “rule out.” It doesn’t mean you are having a stroke. But given the sudden onset of these symptoms, it’s prudent to investigate. I’m going to order a stat CT scan of your brain to assess for any signs of a stroke or other structural abnormalities. I will also order an MRI to rule out any inflammatory processes. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of high-dose prednisone, which may help reduce inflammation around the facial nerve. But please understand, this is only a presumptive treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Prednisone? Is that… strong? I don't like taking a lot of medication. What are the side effects? And how long will this scan take? I have a luncheon! And what if it is a stroke? What happens then? You're not explaining anything properly! This is all very stressful! Honestly, I expected a much more… reassuring experience from a doctor. And luncheon is at 12:30! I really need you to tell me what’s going on now!
DOCTOR: Prednisone is a corticosteroid. It can have side effects, including increased appetite, fluid retention, and mood changes. However, in this case, the potential benefits of reducing inflammation outweigh the risks. The CT scan will take approximately 30 minutes. And regarding the possibility of a stroke... if the scan reveals any evidence of a stroke, you will require immediate hospitalization and potentially thrombolytic therapy. Look, I understand your anxiety. But I need you to remain calm. We are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. I will explain everything in more detail after we have the results of the scan. Please go to the radiology department immediately. They are expecting you. And try not to worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, not that I know of. Though I do get a bit of a rash if I use certain soaps. But that’s not relevant, is it? Honestly, this is all so overwhelming. A rash isn’t going to help me right now. Just… please hurry up with this scan. I have a very important luncheon! And I really don't want to have a stroke! What if I can’t… speak properly afterwards? This is just dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Alright, fine. I’ll go to radiology. But I expect answers as soon as possible. And I expect a full explanation. Don’t keep me waiting. And be nice. It’s all I ask. .
