DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it's my bruising. It's just...worse lately. I'm on a blood thinner, and I keep getting these big bruises, even from just bumping into things. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I'd like to figure out what's going on, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Courtnye. That's definitely something we should look into. Bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is a valid concern. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising becoming more frequent or severe?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It started…probably about a month ago? Maybe six weeks? It was just little things at first, like a small bruise after carrying groceries. But then it started getting bigger, and happening more often. Last week I just bumped my arm on the doorframe and got a huge one. It's just...not normal, even for being on the blood thinner, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A month or six weeks is a good timeframe to work with. And you're right to be concerned if it feels different than what you'd expect from the medication. Just to clarify, what medication are you currently taking for blood thinning?
PATIENT: It's…Warfarin, I think? The little orange pills. I've been on it for about two years now, ever since the doctor found that clot in my leg. I usually get my levels checked regularly, but the last check was…July 12th, I believe. Everything was stable then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin, and your last INR was stable on July 12th. That's helpful. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um…not really. No, I haven't. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, no weird tiredness…nothing like that. Just the bruises. They don’t hurt too bad, just…look awful. And I'm a bit worried it means the medicine isn't doing what it's supposed to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no other bleeding symptoms. It's understandable to be concerned about the medication's effectiveness. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the blood clot in your leg?
PATIENT: Just the clot, really. And high blood pressure, but that's managed with pills. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just normal getting older, I guess. Nothing else major, honestly. I try to stay healthy, eat well...you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. That's good to know. And you said you try to stay healthy. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No smoking, never have. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing crazy. I definitely don't drink every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine, that’s good to know. Now, regarding your family history, are there any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising tendencies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…not that I know of. My mum and dad both lived to be pretty old, and they were both fine. My brother's healthy as a horse. Nobody ever talked about bleeding problems, or anything like that. I don't think so, anyway. I'd probably know, right?
DOCTOR: You would likely know, yes. Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders. Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, besides the Warfarin and the blood pressure medication. Include any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Okay, let me think... besides those two, I take a multivitamin every day. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I'll take ibuprofen. The regular kind, you get it at the store. I also take fish oil, for my heart. But that's it, honestly. I try not to take a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and fish oil. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just take a look at your bruising, check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I just want to get this figured out, so whatever you need to do. I'm a bit worried about the bruising, like I said. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of it, Courtnye. It's good you're proactive about this. Let's start with taking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Now, regarding the bruising…I’m seeing several ecchymoses – that's the medical term for bruises – on your forearms and legs. They vary in size, and some appear relatively recent. They are tender to the touch, but not significantly. There's no swelling or warmth beyond what I'd expect with bruising. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it’s possible the bruising is related to the Warfarin, even with a stable INR. However, it’s important to rule out other causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to get a better picture of your blood's ability to clot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A CBC and…coagulation panel, right? Okay. Is that just a blood test? How long will it take to get the results? I have a hair appointment on Friday, I hope it doesn't interfere with that.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a routine blood test. The lab should be able to get the results back within 24-48 hours, so well before your hair appointment on Friday. I'll have the results faxed to my office, and we can schedule a quick follow-up to discuss them then. In the meantime, are you taking any other medications or supplements that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: No, I'm pretty sure that's everything. I really try to keep it simple. Just the blood pressure pills, the Warfarin, the multivitamin, fish oil, and ibuprofen when needed. I swear! I'm not trying to hide anything, I just...forget things sometimes, you know? It's probably a woman thing. Is there anything else I need to do? Should I stop taking anything? I really don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to forget things, Courtnye, it happens to the best of us. And no, please do not stop taking any of your medications without talking to me first. Continuing your current regimen is important until we have the results back. I'm ordering the CBC and coagulation panel now. I’ll also send a note to the lab to prioritize the results. Once we get the results, we can assess your overall blood health and clotting factors. If everything comes back normal, we may simply monitor the bruising more closely. If there are any abnormalities, we'll discuss further steps, which could include adjusting your Warfarin dosage or considering other potential causes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It's just…worrying, you know? I don't want to end up in the hospital or anything. So, just wait for the results, then call the office? How will I know when they’re back? And…is it expensive, this test? I don't have insurance, so I'm always a bit worried about costs.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Courtnye. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, and worrying is natural. The lab will send the results directly to my office. My medical assistant, Sarah, will review them, and she’ll call you as soon as we have them and can schedule a follow-up appointment. Regarding the cost…because you don't have insurance, I'll have Sarah check with the lab to see if they offer any discounted rates or payment plans. We can also explore some local resources that might offer financial assistance for lab tests. I don’t have the exact cost information available at this moment, but Sarah will be able to provide you with a clear breakdown. To recap, we’ve ordered a CBC and coagulation panel. Sarah will contact you once the results are available, and she’ll also help you with any cost-related concerns. Is there anything else I can address before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it. Okay, so I just wait for Sarah to call? And don’t stop taking my pills. Got it. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I'm glad I could ease your worries a bit. Yes, just wait for Sarah to call. And absolutely, do not stop taking your medications until we've discussed the results. I’ll make a note in your chart to ensure Sarah reaches out to you promptly. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
