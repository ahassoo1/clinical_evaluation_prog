DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, the army, see? They want me to take a… a test. Before they let me actually be in the army. Seems silly, but rules are rules. They sent me here. Said I needed a check-up first. Don't see why, I feel fine. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: A pre-enlistment examination, you say. Yes, quite standard, though the necessity often escapes those in… robust health, shall we say. Fine is a subjective term, Mr. Hartness. We will need to establish a baseline, for their records, naturally. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Known conditions? No. Absolutely not. I’ve never been sick a day in my life, practically. Maybe a cold now and then, like anyone, but nothing serious. My wife, Ingrid, she’s always fussing, saying I should “take care of myself”, but honestly, I work hard. Builds character, you know? No time for being sick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Why would I need surgeries? I haven't broken anything, haven't had anything removed. I keep myself in good shape. Ingrid always says I’m too stubborn to go to the doctor unless I’m practically missing a limb. Which, thankfully, I’m not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family?
PATIENT: Family? What about them? Ingrid, she's fine. A bit of a worrier, like I said. My father, he was… a strong man. Worked in the shipyard his whole life. Never a sick day, just like me. Mother, she passed a few years back. Old age, mostly. No… no special illnesses, not that I recall. They were… sensible people. Not ones for complaining.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. Good. Now, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat whatever’s put in front of me. Ingrid makes a lovely herring stew, even if it smells a bit strong. And I don’t go avoiding things just because someone says they might cause a problem. That’s just…weak. I’m a Swede. We’re hardy folk.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Why would I be? I told you, I don’t need medications. I work hard, eat good food, and sleep when I’m tired. That’s all a man needs. Honestly, this is…a bit insulting, you know? Like you think I’m going to be falling apart.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Since you insist you are in perfect health, we shall proceed with a brief physical examination, purely for documentation purposes. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs. And please, try to remain still.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. It's a waste of time, but if you must. Don't expect much, doctor. I'm a very healthy man.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Pulse is 78, regular. Respiratory rate 16. Temperature normal. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Throat appears clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Height is 187 centimeters, weight is 53 kilograms. BMI is… significantly underweight. Your weight is quite low for your height, Mr. Hartness. Are you maintaining an adequate caloric intake?
PATIENT: Adequate? Of course I am! I work hard all day! I eat what Ingrid puts in front of me, and it’s plenty. She makes good food. Herring, potatoes, sometimes meatballs… It's traditional Swedish food! Maybe I'm just…naturally lean. Some men are built different, you know? I'm not some…soft city fellow. BMI… what even is a BMI? Sounds like nonsense.
DOCTOR: BMI, Mr. Hartness, is a calculation used to assess body composition. Your result indicates you are significantly underweight, which can be indicative of underlying health concerns. We should order some blood work to rule out any deficiencies or other issues. And frankly, given your elevated blood pressure, a cardiac evaluation is also prudent. This is not merely “nonsense,” Mr. Hartness. It is a necessary step to ensure your overall health. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, I told you, I feel fine! Absolutely fine! I don't need your fancy calculations and blood work! This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple check-up for the army, not a… a full medical investigation! Ingrid will have a field day with this. I do not consent. Just give me a piece of paper saying I’m healthy enough and let me go. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your health and well-being. To simply sign off on a pre-enlistment physical without proper evaluation would be…negligent. Your weight and blood pressure are concerning, and ignoring them is not an option. I can document that you refused recommended blood work and cardiac evaluation, but I will not falsely certify you as being in optimal health. You are welcome to seek a second opinion, of course. But I strongly advise you to reconsider. Perhaps it would be best to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns further. .
