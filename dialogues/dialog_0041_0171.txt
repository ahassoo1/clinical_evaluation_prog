DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's...the nails. They look funny. Not good funny. I think. I don't really...remember what happened. Just noticed them. They changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, "the nails." I understand. Changed how, exactly?
PATIENT: Changed...like the color. And they’re kinda…thick. Not like, pretty thick, just…not normal. I don't know what normal is anymore, to be honest. Everything feels off these days. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe a few months? I really don't keep track. Time just…goes. I think it started after I got that new hand lotion, but that lotion smelled so good...probably not that, right? People put all kinds of stuff on their hands.
DOCTOR: <stage>I chuckle softly. “That’s true, a lot of things go on our hands. And it's okay if you’re unsure of the timing. A few months is helpful. Do you remember any injury to your hands or nails recently, even something small?
PATIENT: Injury? No… I don’t think so. I do a lot of…well, I work with ears. People’s ears. Lots of poking around. But I wear gloves! Good gloves. I always tell my patients, "Keep those ears clean!" But my hands…no, no injury. Unless you count that time I burned myself making tea…that wasn't my hands though. That was my tongue. Stupid hot tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent injury to the hands themselves. And you wear gloves when you're working. That's good. Now, let’s take a closer look. Would you mind if I examined your hands and nails?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don't poke too hard. They're sensitive, you know. And wash your hands first. You've been touching…everything. People’s ears, probably. Germs, germs everywhere.
DOCTOR: Of course. Clean hands are very important. Okay…I’m seeing some discoloration and thickening, particularly on a few of these nails. They also appear a bit brittle. It doesn’t seem to be causing you any pain right now, is that correct?
PATIENT: No pain. Just…ugly. They’re embarrassing. I gotta shake people’s hands all the time for work, you know? “Nice to meet you!” and then…these. It’s not a good look. And I don’t wanna give people germs!
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what I'm seeing, it could be a fungal infection of the nails, which is quite common. It can cause that discoloration and thickening you're noticing. That's why it's important to maintain good hygiene and avoid sharing nail tools. Now, to be sure, we could do a test to confirm. We’d scrape a small sample from under the nail to look at under a microscope. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fungus? Like…in my nails? Oh, goodness. That sounds awful! Like something you get in a locker room. I haven’t been to a locker room in years! And scraping? No, no scraping. That sounds painful. Can't you just…tell me it's nothing? I don’t like things being scraped off of me. Especially my nails. They’re already embarrassing without being scraped!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your hesitation. Scraping can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s a quick procedure. It’s the most reliable way to get a definitive diagnosis. Without it, it's difficult to say for sure what's causing the changes. However, since you’re so concerned about it, and we haven't seen signs of a more serious condition, we could try a topical antifungal cream first. It might resolve the issue. But it will take several months to see improvement, and it’s not guaranteed to work. Would you prefer to try that route first?
PATIENT: Topical cream? Like…lotion? That I can handle. Lotion is good. I like lotion. And if it takes months…well, I'm used to waiting. Everything takes months these days. But if it doesn’t work…you won't make me scrape, right? Promise?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. A topical antifungal cream. And I promise, we won’t do any scraping unless absolutely necessary. We'll try the cream first and see how you respond. If it doesn’t improve after a few months, we can re-evaluate and discuss other options then. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…acceptable. A few months of lotion. I can do lotion. What kind of lotion? Does it smell good? I prefer lavender, but anything floral is fine. And do I have to wash my hands every time before I put it on? Because that's a pain. A real pain.
DOCTOR: Good. We have a few different options. I can prescribe a cream with a mild floral scent. It doesn’t have a strong lavender fragrance, unfortunately, but it’s pleasant. As for washing, it’s best to wash your hands before each application to ensure the cream absorbs properly. But, I wouldn’t say every time. Just try to do it at least twice a day—once in the morning and once before bed. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Twice a day…okay. Morning and night. I can do that. As long as I don’t have to scrub my skin off. And if it doesn’t work…you promise you won’t poke around? I just want normal nails. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. And I promise, we will avoid any poking or scraping unless absolutely necessary. We'll start with the cream and see how it goes. I’ll write you a prescription for a topical antifungal cream—clotrimazole—and include instructions on how to apply it. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to assess your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Three months…okay. Three months of lotion. And no scraping. Good. Write the prescription. And make sure it smells nice. Floral, remember? Don't want anything medicinal smelling. That would be awful. Okay, I guess that's all. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I’ve just sent the prescription to your pharmacy. It’s a floral-scented clotrimazole cream. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you back here in three months. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. You too, doctor. Bye bye. And…don't let the germs bite!
