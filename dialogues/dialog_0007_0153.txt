DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… something about a check-up? For… work. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. They said something about needing a clearance… for a performance. Yes, that's it. A performance. I work at the theatre, you see. Lobby mostly, but… yes. Can we just get this over with? No offense, Doctor. I just… have a lot on my mind.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Brando. We can definitely try to get this done efficiently. A work clearance for a theatre performance…okay. So, just to clarify – is this a new job at the theatre, or have you been working there for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. A long while. Decades, I think? It’s… hard to keep track these days. I started taking tickets, then moved to ushering… and now mostly just the lobby. It’s… repetitive, but it keeps me busy. Is knowing exactly when I started important? I… don’t recall the precise date, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Brando, the precise date isn't critical. Just trying to get a sense of your overall health history. Decades at the theatre – that's wonderful! Okay, so you’ve been doing lobby work for some time now. Are you experiencing any specific issues or symptoms right now that prompted this clearance?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… no, not really. Just… old. Everything feels a bit… worn out, if that makes sense. Aches and pains, you know? Normal old-man stuff. Nothing specific that made me come here. They just… told me to come. I don't feel sick. Is there something wrong if I don’t have symptoms? I’m probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Brando. It’s very common for things to feel “worn out” as we get older, and a clearance is a good idea even without specific symptoms. Just wanting to make sure everything is functioning as it should. Let’s just do a quick run-through, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick is good. Very good. Lead the way, Doctor. I… I hope it doesn’t involve too much bending. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, fair enough. We’ll take it easy. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it’s quick, and doesn’t involve… jumping jacks. Honestly, I haven’t done a jumping jack in… well, a very long time. I feel a bit silly even talking about it. Just… let me know if anything feels strange, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brando. No jumping jacks, I promise. We’ll stop immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, blood pressure is 148 over 85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16, nice and steady. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breathing is a bit shallow. Do you have any history of heart problems or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh dear. I… I think the doctor back in Chinatown mentioned something once, a long time ago. Something about a leaky valve, maybe? I honestly don’t remember much of what he said. He spoke very quickly. And… no, not really shortness of breath. Unless I’m running for a bus, which, admittedly, doesn’t happen very often these days. Is the murmur bad? Should I be worried? I feel… a little lightheaded now, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brando, let’s not jump to conclusions. A murmur can be many things, and doesn’t automatically mean there's a serious problem. The fact that you haven't noticed shortness of breath is good. We can definitely investigate it further. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I had… the flu, quite a few times. And a bad back, as I mentioned. And… arthritis in my hands, I think. My wife used to rub them with ointment. She knew all that stuff. Now… I vaguely recall a problem with my stomach, years ago. An ulcer, maybe? I took some pills for it. That's about all I can remember, honestly. It’s all a bit… blurry. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, far too long. Is it bad that I can’t remember? I’m starting to feel like a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: You're not a terrible patient at all, Brando. It’s very common for details to become fuzzy over time, especially if you haven’t been to the doctor regularly. The important thing is we're trying to piece things together now. Do you recall any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. That’s the only one I’m absolutely certain of. And… vaguely, I remember something about my appendix. But my wife handled all the arrangements, so I don’t have the details. I just… woke up in a hospital bed afterward. Is it important to know exactly when those were? I… I really don't recall the dates, Doctor. I apologize. My memory is just… not what it used to be. Honestly, I’m probably just taking up your valuable time. Perhaps I should just… leave.
DOCTOR: Brando, please don't apologize, and please don’t feel like you’re wasting my time. It’s alright that you don’t remember the dates. We’ll work with what you do remember. The tonsillectomy and possible appendectomy are good to know. Now, to get a little broader… could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's a long story. My father… he was a strong man, a farmer. He lived a long life, but… he had heart problems, I think. He always complained of chest pains. My mother… she was a very kind woman, but… she had diabetes, I believe. And… my older brother, he… he passed away young, from something with his lungs. Smoking, I think. I don't recall much else, honestly. My family wasn't one for talking about… ailments. It was considered bad luck, I think. Is this helpful, Doctor? I’m trying my best, but my memory… it's like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Brando, thank you. Knowing about the heart problems, diabetes, and lung issues in your family is valuable information. It helps us understand potential risks. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My brother tried to get me to, when we were young, but I refused. It smelled awful. And… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, years ago. But my wife didn’t approve, so I stopped. Now, I drink only tea. And… no, absolutely no drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a very… respectable man, Doctor. I lead a quiet life. Just tea, and the theatre, mostly. Is that… satisfactory? I hope I’m not boring you. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Brando. You're not boring me, and it's very helpful to know that you don't smoke, drink excessively, or use drugs. That's excellent. Now, last question for this section: Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That's another tough one. I… I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. My wife used to give me penicillin when I had a sore throat, and that was always fine. But… I’m vaguely aware of being a little sensitive to… dust? I sneeze a lot when I’m cleaning. But it’s not a serious allergy, I don’t think. Just… a little sniffly. I honestly can’t recall anything major. I hope that’s… helpful. Is there anything else I should be telling you, Doctor? I feel like I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known major allergies, and a bit of sensitivity to dust – good to know. You've been very thorough, Brando, thank you. Alright, it seems the clinic doesn’t have much in the way of past records for you. That's not uncommon. Given your age, family history, and the murmur I heard, I'd like to do a few simple tests. A blood test to check your cholesterol and blood sugar. And an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Yes, alright. As long as they’re not too… invasive. And if they take too long, please let me know. I have… commitments, you see. The theatre, mostly. And… well, I just prefer to get things over with quickly. Blood test and EKG… yes. As long as it doesn't involve… needles, if I can avoid it? I’m not a fan of needles, Doctor. I get a little… faint. Is that possible? To avoid the needles, if at all feasible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brando. We'll do our best to make you comfortable. The blood draw is unavoidable, unfortunately, but we can use a smaller needle and I’ll be very careful. And we can have you lie down during the blood draw if you're concerned about feeling faint. As for the EKG, it's completely non-invasive. We just attach some small stickers to your chest. No needles involved at all. Let me have the nurse come in and draw the blood first, and then we’ll do the EKG. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood first… and then the stickers. As long as the stickers don't… stick too tightly. I have… sensitive skin, you see. And please, let me know if anything feels strange or uncomfortable. I just… I prefer to be informed, Doctor. I get a little anxious when I don't know what's happening. Is that… unreasonable? I hope I’m not being a bother. I just… want this to be over with quickly, and safely. And… please, tell the nurse I dislike needles. Perhaps she can be extra gentle?
DOCTOR: Not at all unreasonable, Brando. I understand your anxiety, and we will absolutely keep you informed every step of the way. I will personally tell the nurse about your concerns and ask her to be extra gentle with the blood draw. We’ll take it slow, and if you start to feel uncomfortable at any point, just let us know immediately, and we’ll stop. Here’s the nurse now. She’s very experienced and will take good care of you. “Nurse Chen, this is Brando Krahn. He’s here for a work clearance. He’s a bit anxious about the blood draw, so if you could be extra gentle, that would be greatly appreciated.” Okay, Brando, the nurse will get you set up for the blood draw first. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels wrong. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… yes. Easy to say. But… thank you, Doctor. For being… understanding. And thank you to the nurse, too. I’ll… try my best. Just… please, be gentle. And… please, let me know what you're doing, alright? I prefer to be informed, as I mentioned. Yes. Gentle and informed. That’s all I ask. I… I hope I’m not being a nuisance. I just… don't like surprises. And… needles. Definitely needles. .
