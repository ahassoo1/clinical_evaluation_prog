DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it's about this… clearance thing. For the… show. It's a physical, right? They said I needed one. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. A lot of things are these days. I just want to get it over with, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A physical for a show… alright. Let me just confirm some basic information. I see here your name is Brando Krahn, age 69, and I have your height and weight listed as 199 centimeters and 118 kilograms. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Ninety-nine… and one-eighteen… sounds about right. Yes, that's… that’s me, I think. I haven’t really checked in a while. It’s been… a long time since anyone asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And you mentioned this is for a show… could you tell me a little bit more about what the show involves?
PATIENT: It's… acting. Mostly ushering, I think. And taking tickets. Maybe a bit of helping folks find their seats. It’s… low-key. Not a starring role, you understand. Just… being there. It's at the… oh dear. The community center, I believe? It’s been a while since they told me the details. A friend asked me to help out. I like being around people.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Krahn. It's good to stay active and engaged. So, this physical is to ensure you're fit to handle the duties of ushering and assisting at the community center. To start, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… Hmm. That’s a tough one. I’ve… I used to have a bad back, years ago. From… lifting things. But that’s mostly gone now. And… honestly, Doctor, I just get tired easily. Old age, I suppose. I don’t really have any conditions, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common to have aches and pains with age, and feeling tired can have many causes. We'll try to figure things out. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… There was something… a long time ago. My appendix, I think? When I was a young man. But that was… decades ago. I don’t remember much about it. It all happened so fast. And… nothing else. No, I don’t think so. Nothing else that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… I was married, once. A long time ago. Divorced now. No children. I have… a sister, somewhere. We don’t really keep in touch. It’s been years. She lives… far away. I don’t know anything about her health, or… anything, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krahn. Knowing your family history can be helpful. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or over-the-counter supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not currently. I… I used to take something for my blood pressure, maybe? A long, long time ago. But the doctor took me off it. Said it wasn’t necessary. So, no. Nothing at all. Just… a lot of tea. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and tea definitely doesn’t count as medication! Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing serious, anyway. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I'm around cats, but that's about it. It's a mild irritation, not a proper allergy. Nothing that requires a shot or anything like that. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant allergies. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... well, it's quiet. Mostly at home. I read. I watch a bit of television. I walk to the store sometimes. Not far, mind you. I try to stay active, but… getting older makes things difficult. I don’t smoke. Never have. And… I used to drink a little, socially, but I stopped years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good. Now, Mr. Krahn, before we move on to a physical exam, are you experiencing any current symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... Current symptoms… Let me think… sometimes my knees ache, especially when the weather is cold. And I get a little short of breath when I climb stairs. But that's just age, I suppose. Nothing major. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. Nothing that keeps me from doing things, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Knee pain and shortness of breath with exertion. We’ll definitely take a look at that. Alright, Mr. Krahn, let’s go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Krahn… and exhale slowly. Good. Again, deep breath in… and out. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Just let me know what you need me to do. I’m not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No problem at all, Mr. Krahn. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. A little… firm, maybe? But no pain. I think it's just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a bit uncomfortable, I must admit. There's a little creaking sound. And… a bit of stiffness. It's worse in the mornings, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s some tenderness and swelling here. Range of motion is limited, and there’s crepitus with movement. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And finally, let me just take a look at your feet. Okay, Mr. Krahn, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Finished, then? That wasn't so bad, actually.
DOCTOR: Yes, finished. Alright, Mr. Krahn, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which is common with age. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you report some fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. Your heart and lungs sound okay, but we’ll want to investigate the fatigue and shortness of breath a bit further. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Investigate further…? Oh dear. Does that mean… something’s wrong? I just wanted a clearance for the show, you know. Is it something serious? I don't want to cause any trouble. I just want to help out.
DOCTOR: No, please don't worry, Mr. Krahn. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is serious. “Investigate further” just means we need to do some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It’s better to be thorough, especially since you mentioned fatigue and shortness of breath. We’ll start with some basic blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We can also consider a chest X-ray to get a look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Blood work… A chest X-ray… Oh dear. It all sounds… complicated. But… I suppose if it's necessary. I just don't want to be a burden. If it's too much trouble… But… alright. If you think it’s best, then do the tests. Just… tell me if it's going to be expensive. I’m… not really in a position to pay for a lot of things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Krahn. We'll certainly keep cost in mind, and we can discuss options if needed. I’ll order the basic blood work, which should give us a good starting point. The chest X-ray will also be helpful. We can also see if the community center has any insurance options available. The blood work can be done at the lab just down the street. They will draw some blood, and the results should be back in a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results and plan accordingly. In the meantime, please try to stay active as much as you can, but don’t overexert yourself. If you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Chest pain… dizziness… Right. I’ll remember that. Staying active… not overexerting myself… It sounds… manageable. The lab down the street… alright. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for… not making me feel like a burden. I appreciate that. I suppose… I’ll go to the lab, then. And wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the lab requisition and some instructions. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and they are open Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. We’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment in about a week. We’ll review the results and discuss a plan for managing your osteoarthritis and addressing the fatigue and shortness of breath. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. I suppose… I should be going, then. I have a few things to do. Thank you for your time. And for… everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you need anything. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. A good day to you as well. .
