DOCTOR: Alright, so…Thyra Fabing, 35 years old. Yes, yes. Look, I have a lot of patients, so let's just get right to it. Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Well, hi. Um, I just need to get some forms filled out, that's all. Medicare sent me over here to do that, I think. Something about needing a doctor's signature for something? I don’t really know all the details.
DOCTOR: Forms. Right. Medicare. Always forms. Look, I’m a doctor, not a…paperwork assistant. What exactly did Medicare say you need signed?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don't remember exactly what they said. Something about needing verification… maybe for continued coverage? The lady on the phone was talking pretty fast and I didn’t write it down. I just have this paper they gave me. Here it is. Maybe you can tell me what needs doing?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Functional assessment. Of course. Look, this is…basic stuff. It wants to know if you can, you know, function. Get up, walk around, use the toilet. Do you need me to explain what all this means?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, yeah, I see. Functional assessment. That makes sense, I guess. No, I don't need you to explain what it means, just… what you need from me to fill it out. Like, do you need me to do anything while I'm here, or can I just answer the questions? I'm pretty good at getting around, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Look, “pretty good” isn’t a medical assessment. I need to see you move. Get up from that chair. Walk a few steps. Simple things. Don't be difficult. It's just a formality, really. Though, frankly, Medicare should have more stringent requirements. Go on, now.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sorry. It's just… I haven't been feeling my best lately, so it takes me a minute sometimes to get going. Is that alright? Should I do anything specific?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your gait is…not optimal. A slight limp, favoring the left side. Balance seems…adequate, but not strong. And you're slow. Very slow. Okay, now, can you squat down and stand up?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. This might be a little rough. There. I can do it, but it’s not…easy. My knee gets kinda cranky. Is that what you needed to see?
DOCTOR: Knee. Yes. Crankiness isn’t a diagnosis, you know. It suggests something, but… Never mind. Alright. Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Sometimes my back bothers me, especially after I've been on my feet all day. It's a dull ache, mostly in my lower back. It usually goes away if I sit down and rest for a bit. It hasn’t been bad lately, but it's always there, kinda. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Kinda.” Everything is always “kinda” with people. Look, I'm documenting "lower back pain, intermittent, patient reports 'kinda' discomfort." It’s not very precise, but it's what I’m getting. Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Hmm... I get pretty tired, actually. More tired than I used to, even when I've had enough sleep. It’s hard to explain. Like… just worn out, all the time. It’s been getting worse slowly over the last few months, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Fatigue. Intermittent. Vague. Yes, yes. Look, this is… insufficient. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I eat about the same as always, I think. Maybe I haven't been as hungry lately, but I figured that was just because I'm tired all the time. I don't really feel like eating a lot when I'm worn out, you know? Nothing major, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Look, I’ve got enough information for the basic assessment. Frankly, it’s all rather… non-specific. I’m documenting “fatigue, possible mild anorexia, lower back pain.” It’s enough for Medicare. Here. Take this. I recommend… getting more rest. And possibly seeing a physical therapist for your back. It’s probably just muscle strain. Next patient.
PATIENT: Okay... Thank you, I guess. So... that's it? I don't need any other tests or anything? It just... feels like there's something more going on, but maybe I'm wrong. .
DOCTOR: . Look, I’ve seen a hundred patients today, and you're not a specialist. If you have concerns, see a specialist. Don’t waste my time with “feelings”. Always something.
