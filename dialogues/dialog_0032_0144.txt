DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Pipkorn, is it? Yes, well... honestly, I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. My daughter scheduled it, you see. She worries too much. Just thought I’d see what all the fuss was about, I suppose. Old age, you know. Things start to... slip.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common for family members to encourage preventative care. While I appreciate your daughter’s concern, it is helpful for me to understand what specific issues prompted this appointment. Even if it’s just a general check-up, knowing what your daughter is worried about can guide the examination. Can you recall anything she specifically mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. She kept going on about my memory. Said I was repeating myself. Honestly, I think she just doesn't listen properly! But... she also mentioned something about my hands. Said they were shaky when I was trying to thread a needle for my quilting. Though, I've always had a bit of a tremor, haven't I? It's nothing new. Really, I feel fine. Perfectly capable. It’s just… things aren't as easy as they used to be. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. The memory concerns and hand tremor are both pertinent. You mention the tremor isn’t new – how long have you noticed it, and has it been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Progressively… is that a fancy word for getting worse? I don't keep track of these things, dear. It's always been there, a little shake. Probably since I was… well, a long time ago. Maybe ten years? Twenty? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, and other times… well, like when I'm trying to do something delicate. It’s frustrating, but I manage. I always have. Though, I suppose now it takes a bit longer to get things done. My hands aren’t what they used to be, that’s for certain. I used to be such a precise surgeon, you know.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a surgical technician. For many years. At St. Jude’s. Though, that was a long time ago. Before… well, before everything. It was a good career, very steady. You had to be precise, calm under pressure. Things are different now, of course. I retired years ago. Mostly quilting these days. Though, it’s getting harder and harder to see the tiny stitches.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel… normal. Tired, maybe. But who isn't? And my knees ache a bit when the weather changes. That’s just old age, isn't it? Honestly, dear, I don't go looking for things to be wrong with me. It just makes you feel worse. I suppose… sometimes I feel a little… off balance. But that could be my eyesight. Or the medication my daughter makes me take. She’s always so worried.
DOCTOR: Let’s clarify these symptoms. You mentioned feeling "off balance." Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s hard to explain. Not like dizzy, exactly. More like… unsteady. Like I might stumble. It happens mostly when I stand up quickly. Or when I turn my head. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. I usually just hold onto something. It's not a big deal, really. I’ve always been a bit clumsy. My husband used to tease me about it. Is this important? I mean, I'm not falling over or anything.
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Ms. Calvery. And it’s important for me to get a complete picture. Now, let's discuss your medications. Can you tell me what you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. My daughter manages most of that. Let me think… there's a little white pill for my blood pressure, I think. And a pink one for cholesterol. And something for my… oh, what was it? Arthritis, maybe? It’s a small blue pill. And then there’s a vitamin D supplement. She says I don’t get enough sun. Honestly, I’ve lost track. She puts them in these little boxes every week. I just take what she gives me. I don't really pay attention to the names.
DOCTOR: I see. That makes it difficult. We will need to obtain a complete medication list from your daughter. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don't think so. I've always been pretty lucky that way. I remember being stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that didn't seem to bother me too much. And I'm not particularly fond of shellfish, but that’s just a matter of taste. No, I don't have any real allergies. Unless… is dust an allergy? I do sneeze a lot when I’m cleaning. But that’s probably just the dust.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I will start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’d also like to assess your reflexes and check your gait and balance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that? Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don't like being poked and prodded, but I trust your judgement, dear. Just try to be gentle, alright? My skin is rather sensitive these days. And please don’t take too long. I have a quilting circle this afternoon.
DOCTOR: “Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths.” I use the stethoscope to auscultate her heart sounds, listening for any murmurs or irregularities. Then, I listen to her lungs, listening for any wheezes or crackles. “Heart sounds are normal, with no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally.”
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Clear lungs, you say? My mother always had a terrible cough. It’s good to know mine are… clear. Are you sure my blood pressure is only a little elevated? My daughter is always fussing over my salt intake. She says it’s terrible for my heart. Perhaps I should cut back on the kimchi... though, I do love kimchi.
DOCTOR: “Your blood pressure is mildly elevated, Ms. Calvery. It is not an immediate concern, but it is something we should monitor. Dietary modifications, such as reducing sodium intake, can be helpful. Your daughter is correct to be concerned about salt. However, moderate consumption is generally acceptable. Now, I’m going to examine your ears, nose, and throat.” I use an otoscope to examine her ears. “Ears are clear, with normal tympanic membranes bilaterally.” I examine her nose. “Nose is clear, with no signs of congestion.” I use a tongue depressor to examine her throat. “Throat is clear, with no redness or swelling.”
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief. I always worry about my ears. My hearing isn’t what it used to be, you know. Perhaps that’s why I can’t hear my daughter when she tells me to slow down! She always says I walk too fast. Now, what was I saying? Oh yes, my throat. Good to hear it’s clear. I do enjoy a good cup of tea. What’s next? I really must get back for my quilting circle. Agnes is bringing her new fabric… it’s supposed to be lovely.
DOCTOR: "Very well. Now I'd like to assess your reflexes and check your gait and balance. Please sit back and relax." I test her reflexes in her arms and legs, noting the responses. "Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric, within normal limits." "Now, please stand up slowly." I observe her gait as she stands and walks a few steps. "Walk towards me, please." I observe her gait and balance. "I notice a slightly unsteady gait with a mild base of support."
PATIENT: Oh dear, walking? I told you I wasn’t very good at it! It’s probably just my knees. They’ve been acting up lately. I suppose I should do more exercising… but it’s so tiring. Agnes says I walk like a penguin, you know. She doesn’t mean anything by it, of course. She just has a very… vivid imagination. Is my gait really that bad? It doesn’t feel bad, just a little… careful. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: “Your gait is slightly unsteady, Ms. Calvery, and you do have a wider base of support than ideal. It’s not dramatically abnormal, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think. Chronic conditions… my daughter always tells me what’s wrong with me, so I’m not sure what I remember on my own. I think… I think I had something with my blood sugar a few years ago, but it went away. And my knees, of course. They’ve always been trouble. Arthritis, I think that’s what the doctor said. And I had a bit of a problem with my heart years ago, but it’s been fine since. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I used to be so good at remembering things… now, everything just seems to… slip away. Do you need me to ask my daughter? She’d know for sure.
DOCTOR: "It would be helpful to obtain more detailed information from your daughter. For now, let's move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… well, yes. Quite a few, actually. Being a surgical technician, I was around them all the time. I assisted with all sorts of procedures. Appendectomies, gall bladders… you name it, I saw it. But I didn’t have many myself. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And… oh yes! I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. And… I think I had a small procedure on my knee once, but it wasn’t very serious. Honestly, it’s all a bit hazy. It was all so long ago. I mostly remember helping other people through surgery. That's what I was good at.
DOCTOR: "Alright. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he was a strong, healthy man, but he had some trouble with his eyesight later in life. And my brother… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer. It was very sad. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It was considered… impolite. It was a long time ago. Mostly, I just remember them being… there. And then, they weren't.
DOCTOR: "Very well. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, bless his soul, but I always made him go outside. And alcohol… just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a very small glass. And drugs? Heavens no! I'm a respectable woman, dear. I used to volunteer at the church, you know. I believe in living a clean, healthy life. Mostly. Perhaps the kimchi doesn't count.
DOCTOR: “Now, are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, haven't we been over this? My daughter manages my medications, I told you! And I don’t think I have any allergies. Unless dust counts. Honestly, it's so frustrating trying to remember everything. You're making me feel worse, dear. Can we please get this over with? I really need to get to my quilting circle. Agnes is bringing her new fabric… and I don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: “Very well, Ms. Calvery. Based on our conversation and examination, you present with a slightly unsteady gait, mild memory concerns, and a history of possible pre-diabetes, arthritis, and cardiac issues. Your blood pressure is mildly elevated. Given your difficulties recalling your medical history and medications, and your reported symptoms, I recommend further evaluation. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a referral to a neurologist to assess your memory and balance. We also need to obtain a detailed medication list from your daughter. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that? A neurologist? It sounds… serious. I don’t know, dear. It all seems like a lot. Is it really necessary? I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Perhaps I just need a good night’s sleep. And maybe a little less kimchi. I don’t know… I suppose I can ask my daughter. But honestly, she’ll just worry even more. Can’t we just… leave it at that? I really don’t want to put her through all this trouble. Can't I just come back for a check up in a few months? That seems more reasonable. I don’t want tests or specialists. I want to go to my quilting circle. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Ms. Calvery, while I respect your wishes, I strongly advise against foregoing further evaluation. Your symptoms, while seemingly minor, could indicate an underlying medical condition that requires treatment. However, I will defer to your judgment. I will document your refusal of recommended testing and referral. I can provide a basic work note for your quilting circle if you desire. I will also provide you with information on fall prevention and dietary modifications. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Fall prevention… I've never fallen in my life! Well, not seriously. Just a little stumble here and there. Dietary modifications… My daughter will have a field day with that. No, I don't think I have any further questions. Just… thank you, dear. For trying, I suppose. I think I’ll just go home now. And ask my daughter about all this. She’ll know what to do. She always does. Thank you again. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: “Goodbye, Ms. Calvery. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms.” .
PATIENT: .
