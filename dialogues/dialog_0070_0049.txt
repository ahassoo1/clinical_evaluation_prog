DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, you say? That's a nice name. Well, it's my ears, mostly. They ain't what they used to be, that's for sure. People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it's just me... I don't rightly know. It's just... hard to hear, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common for hearing to change as we get older. And you’re right, sometimes it is the people mumbling! To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm, when did I first notice... That's a tricky one. Seems like it's been a slow thing, not all at once. Maybe... a couple of years ago? Hard to say exactly. My nephew, Timmy, he kept saying I didn't hear him when he was visiting, but Timmy talks so fast, always has. I don't know if that counts. It's mostly when there's a lot of noise, I guess. Like in restaurants. Everything just... blurs together.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been gradual, over a couple of years, and seems to be more noticeable in noisy environments. That’s helpful to know. And yes, noisy restaurants can be challenging for anyone! Besides restaurants, are there any other situations where you find it particularly difficult to hear?
PATIENT: Well... The television, sometimes. My stories... I like my stories, you know? I have to turn it up pretty loud, and even then I miss bits. And… talking on the phone is getting harder. I used to be able to hear everyone just fine. Now I have to ask folks to repeat themselves a lot. Especially my sister, Agnes. She has a quiet voice, always has. It's just... frustrating, mostly. Don't want to bother people all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schneer. It's certainly not wanting to be a burden that makes it difficult. It sounds like the problem is affecting multiple aspects of your life – watching television, talking on the phone, conversations with your sister. Now, have you ever had any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing... Now that you mention it… yes, actually. Sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It’s like… a high-pitched whine, a little bit. It comes and goes. Mostly when I’m tired, I think. Or… when it’s very quiet. It’s not a loud ringing, just… there. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's… unsettling. I never really said anything about it, thought it was just… old age, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to have, Mr. Schneer. A high-pitched whine, intermittent, related to quiet or fatigue. That could be a component of this. Now, before we proceed with an examination, let me ask about your overall medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Let me see… Doctor Miller, bless his soul, he used to take care of me. He’s retired now, though. I think… I had my blood pressure checked once, a long time ago. It was a little high, maybe? He put me on some little pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like taking pills. No, I don’t think I’ve got anything serious. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? Never had diabetes or heart trouble, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with medication you discontinued. And no known history of diabetes or heart disease. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… Surgeries… let me see. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, of course. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, falling off my bicycle. That was when I was about ten years old. Other than that… I don’t think so. Never been in the hospital for anything serious, no. Just… a few overnight stays when I had the flu, maybe. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken wrist, and occasional overnight stays for the flu. Now, Mr. Schneer, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… well, I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it wasn’t doing much good, so I stopped taking that a while back. And… sometimes I take a little bit of aspirin if my head is aching. Just one or two pills, mind you. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. Nothing regular, really. Just bits and pieces when I need them.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you occasionally take aspirin for headaches and a vitamin D supplement in the winter. No regular prescription medications currently. Now, just a few more questions about your family history. Do you have any family members who have experienced hearing loss, tinnitus , or other ear problems?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she was a bit hard of hearing when she got older, I think. She used to say everyone mumbled. But she didn't wear a hearing aid or anything, just turned up the television really loud. And… my Uncle Patrick, he worked in a factory for years, very noisy place it was. He did have some trouble with his ears, I remember. Other than that… I don’t really know. We didn't talk much about those things, back then. It wasn’t something you brought up, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. It wasn’t always common to discuss those things. So your mother had some hearing difficulty in her later years, and your Uncle Patrick worked in a noisy environment and experienced ear problems. That's helpful to know. Finally, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smoking… Well, when I was younger, I used to. Back in the war, everyone smoked. It was just… what you did. But I gave it up a long time ago. Must be… fifty years ago now? Yes, at least. Doctor said it wasn't good for me, and I didn’t want to bother my sister, Agnes. She never liked it. I haven't touched a cigarette since. Never went back.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Schneer. That's all the questions I have for now. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a brief physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat, and perhaps a quick hearing test, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I always did trust doctors. You seem like a nice young man. Go ahead, then. Just… be gentle, alright? Old ears, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schneer. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It's called an otoscope. It has a light and a magnifying glass, so I can see your eardrum. I’ll just gently insert it into your ear canal. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Alright… I see some cerumen, or earwax, in the ear canal, but the eardrum itself appears intact. Now, let's take a look at the other ear. Hm… a bit more cerumen in this ear, but the eardrum also appears intact. Now, I'm going to use this tuning fork to test your hearing. I’ll place it on your forehead and ask you to tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. Can you hear the tone?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It’s a… a kind of ringing sound. Very faint, though. It’s hard to tell. It sort of… fades away. It’s gone now. I think it’s gone. It was very quiet to begin with. Am I doing it right? It's been a long time since anyone tested my hearing.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Mr. Schneer. It is very faint, and you're right, it does fade quickly. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have some cerumen buildup in both ears, and your hearing appears to be slightly diminished, but there are no obvious signs of a more serious problem. It’s possible that the cerumen buildup is contributing to your difficulty hearing. We could try removing it, which might improve your hearing. Would you be interested in having that done?
PATIENT: Remove it, you say? Well… if it would help, yes. That sounds sensible. I don't want to leave it if it's causing the trouble. Is it… painful? I don't like pain, you know. Just… gentle, alright? Old ears, remember.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schneer. I understand your concern. We have several options for removing the earwax. The simplest and most common method is ear irrigation, using warm water. It can sometimes be a little uncomfortable, like a brief pressure sensation, but it’s generally not painful. We can also use ear drops to soften the wax first, which can make the irrigation more comfortable. Before we proceed, do you have any drainage from your ear, or have you experienced any dizziness or ringing in your ears recently?
PATIENT: Drainage… no, no drainage. Not that I’ve noticed. And dizziness… well, sometimes I get a little lightheaded when I stand up too quickly, but that's just old age, I think. Nothing serious. And… the ringing, yes, I told you about that. It comes and goes, mostly when it's quiet. But no, nothing new. It hasn't been worse lately. Just the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Given your medical history and the examination findings, I recommend we proceed with ear irrigation to remove the cerumen. We'll start with the ear drops to soften the wax, and then gently flush the ears with warm water. Do you have any allergies to ear drops or any medications in general?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. My sister, Agnes, she’s allergic to bee stings, but I’ve never been stung. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Go ahead, then. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. First, I’m going to instill a few drops of this cerumenolytic solution into both ears. You may feel a slight tingling sensation. Then, we'll wait about five minutes for it to soften the wax. After that, I'll gently flush the ears with warm water using this syringe. Alright, I’ve instilled the drops. Now, we’ll wait a few minutes. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: It's a bit… strange, but not unpleasant. Just a little tickly, I suppose. It's alright. Nothing to worry about. Just a bit… bubbly, maybe. Like tiny bubbles in my ears. Waiting is the hardest part, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Mr. Schneer. The bubbling sensation is just the drops working to dissolve the wax. Alright, it’s been about five minutes. Now we’ll proceed with the irrigation. I’m going to gently flush your ears with warm water using this syringe. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… a bit cold! And a bit… swishy. It feels strange, like water in my ear, of course. It’s not painful, but it’s… unsettling. A little disorienting, maybe. Is it almost done? It feels a bit… full.
DOCTOR: You're right, it can feel a little strange and disorienting. I apologize if the water was too cold; I’ll adjust the temperature. I'm just flushing out the wax and debris. We'll repeat the process on the other ear now. Alright, that’s all the irrigation we need to do for today. Now, let’s see if that has improved your hearing. Can you hear me clearly now?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… a lot. It feels… different, certainly. A bit clearer, maybe? Yes! You're… louder! I didn't realize how muffled it was before. It's still not perfect, mind you, but it's definitely better. Much better. Thank you, Doctor. That's a big improvement.
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Schneer! That’s a good first step. It appears the cerumen buildup was contributing to your hearing difficulty. However, your hearing is still not quite optimal. It’s possible that you have some age-related hearing loss, which is very common. To get a better understanding of your hearing, I recommend a formal audiological evaluation performed by an audiologist. They can perform a comprehensive hearing test and determine the extent of any hearing loss. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: An audiologist, you say? Well... that sounds sensible. If you think it's best, then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you could schedule an appointment for me, that would be wonderful. I'm not very good with these things, you know. Whatever's easiest for you, really. Just… not too far away, if possible. My nephew, Timmy, he drives me to these things. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. Alright, there’s an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM at the Hearing Solutions clinic, which is just a few blocks away. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… yes, that sounds fine. Yes, that should work. Timmy usually has the afternoon free. That's perfect. Please schedule me for Tuesday at 2:00 PM, then. Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Is there anything else I need to do? Or are we all set?
DOCTOR: Alright, you're all set. I've scheduled you for an audiological evaluation next Tuesday at 2:00 PM at Hearing Solutions. They’ll send you a confirmation email with all the details. For now, just continue to monitor your hearing. If you notice any sudden changes or experience any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. You've answered all my questions, Doctor. Thank you again for your help. You've been very kind and patient with an old man like me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and helping me understand what's going on. I think I'll be on my way now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Schneer. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. .
