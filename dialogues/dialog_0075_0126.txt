DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Panjoj. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I've been awfully thirsty lately, and… hungry, constantly. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s becoming quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased thirst and hunger. That is bothersome. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. Could you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… not just a dry mouth, if you understand. I mean, I drink a normal glass of water and feel like I could drink another right after. And then another. I’ve been keeping a bottle with me constantly, and I'm still feeling parched. It doesn’t really seem to matter what I drink, either – water, tea, juice… doesn’t seem to make much difference. I just… need more.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's not relieved by drinking, and the type of fluid doesn't seem to matter. And you mentioned hunger as well. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, yes. Not like a craving for anything specific, just… an emptiness. I eat a normal meal, and within an hour or so, I’m feeling hungry again. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I feel like I’m eating constantly just to feel… normal, and even then, it doesn’t always work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constant thirst and hunger, not relieved by intake. Have you noticed any changes in your weight – either gaining or losing any weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… haven’t actually weighed myself recently, to be perfectly honest. Now that you mention it, my trousers feel a little tighter, perhaps? But I haven't confirmed it with a scale. I suppose I should be paying more attention. It's been a bit… hectic lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible weight gain, though unconfirmed. And have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s… that’s been happening as well. I seem to be going to the bathroom much more often than usual, and… well, a larger volume each time, if you understand. I just put it down to drinking more, but… now that you ask, it’s probably more frequent than it should be, even considering the thirst.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, increased hunger, possible weight gain, and increased urination. Those four together are certainly something we need to investigate further. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… I believe my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something… I don’t recall the specifics, truthfully. She was… unwell for a long time before she passed, and I vaguely remember my mother mentioning something about sugar levels. It wasn’t discussed much, to be frank. I wasn’t particularly close to her, and my mother… wasn’t one for details. I don’t know if it was diabetes specifically, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible family history of diabetes, though unconfirmed. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and no known food allergies. I’m usually quite careful with what I eat, though I haven’t had cause to be overly cautious. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, if needed, but nothing consistent. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, if you understand. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I feel rather foolish asking, but… it’s concerning me, naturally.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking, and no, you're not being foolish. It's right to be concerned. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination, possible weight gain, and a possible family history – we need to run some tests to rule out a few possibilities, the most important being diabetes. I'd like to do a blood sugar test now, and a urine sample. That will give us a good starting point. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. A blood sugar test and a urine sample. Of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me have the nurse come in and draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It's a standard procedure, shouldn't take more than a few minutes. While we're waiting, perhaps you could tell me a little about your typical diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, a few minutes. Well, my diet… isn’t particularly exciting. I work in shipping and receiving, so it’s often whatever’s quickest and easiest. Sandwiches, usually. And I admit, I’m not the most active person. Mostly desk work, with some lifting and moving of packages, of course, but nothing strenuous. I… haven’t been to a gym in years, if I’m being honest. It's a bit of a regrettable habit, I suppose. I should really be taking better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet of mostly sandwiches and limited exercise. Thank you for being honest with me. That information is helpful. Let’s see what the lab results tell us, and then we can discuss the best course of action. The nurse should be with you momentarily.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
