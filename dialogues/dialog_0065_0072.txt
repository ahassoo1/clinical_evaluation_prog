DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's happening more and more, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: “Little things,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and completely lose my train of thought mid-sentence. Yesterday, I made a grocery list, went to the store, and came back with… well, not what was on the list. Just… things. It’s not like huge gaps in my memory, but it’s enough to make me feel… off.
DOCTOR: So, recent onset of forgetfulness, primarily affecting recall of immediate events, and some difficulty maintaining a train of thought. And you say this is a recent change?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It’s… I don’t know, within the last six months, maybe? It used to be just the occasional senior moment, you know? But now it feels like several times a day. It’s not constant, but… frequent enough to be concerning. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a rather subjective term, Ms. Heidenthal. Forgetfulness can be a part of aging, but a sudden increase in frequency, as you describe, warrants investigation. Let's go through a more detailed history. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was because I’ve been busy at work. No headaches, no dizziness, no vision changes… nothing else that stands out. I sleep okay, I guess. Not amazing, but okay. I haven’t noticed any changes in my mood either. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. No associated neurological symptoms - that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, obviously. And I broke my arm once, but that was years ago. No serious illnesses, no hospitalizations… I see my dentist regularly, of course! And I had the usual vaccinations. I’m pretty healthy, generally. I haven't been to a doctor in ages, to be honest, unless it was for a check-up or something.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've managed to avoid those so far, thankfully! I'm not a fan of hospitals, if you can't tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she… well, she had some memory problems towards the end of her life, but we always thought it was just old age. She didn't really go to the doctor much either. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be 85. No dementia or anything like that on his side, as far as I know. I have a brother, and he seems perfectly fine. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does. A history of memory problems in your mother is… relevant. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything, but it’s good to know. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t really drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I work full-time as a dentist, so I’m pretty busy. I don't have a lot of free time, to be honest. Mostly just work and… trying to keep up with things around the house. I don't have any major hobbies, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember to take it! And occasionally ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. No prescriptions, no herbal remedies… nothing like that. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I don’t absolutely need it. Is this all important? It feels like a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, Ms. Heidenthal. But a thorough medical history is essential. It helps me determine the potential causes of your symptoms. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Honestly, I'm a pretty boring patient. No allergies, no major medical issues, no prescriptions… it’s all just this… memory thing. I feel a little silly even being here.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, then. I'll assess your neurological function. It’s standard procedure, and it will help us rule out some of the more obvious causes. We’ll start with your reflexes… Please sit here, and I’ll begin.
PATIENT: Okay. So, what exactly will you be doing? I’m not good with… medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I’ll be testing your reflexes, your coordination, and your balance. I’ll also do a very quick cognitive assessment – just some simple questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It won't be unpleasant. I'll start with your deep tendon reflexes. Please relax your legs… I'm going to tap on your knees with this. It might be a little startling, but it shouldn't hurt. Right leg… and left leg.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… unexpected. Is that normal? It didn't really hurt, but… it was a little jarring.
DOCTOR: It’s standard, Ms. Heidenthal. The reflexes are… within normal limits. Now, let’s assess your coordination. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger. Repeat that several times.
PATIENT: Oh! Sorry. That was a little clumsy. I feel… off balance. Is this… bad? I’m not usually this uncoordinated.
DOCTOR: Slightly diminished coordination, with mild tremor. Now, let's test your short-term memory. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that correct? I think… I think I got them right.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I want you to repeat those three words again… after a short delay.
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… table… I’m sorry, I… I can’t remember the third word. It’s on the tip of my tongue… something shiny… a coin… I just can’t…
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the initial assessment, and considering your history, I suspect we're dealing with early cognitive impairment. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but further investigation is necessary. We'll need to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I'm ordering a comprehensive blood panel, and I'm scheduling you for a neuroimaging scan - an MRI of the brain. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment…? What does that mean…? Is that… bad? An MRI…? I… I don’t know what to say. I just came in because I was forgetting things… I didn’t think it was anything serious. This sounds… scary. What… what are the chances it's nothing?
DOCTOR: "Nothing" is always a possibility, Ms. Heidenthal. However, the recent onset of memory loss, coupled with the findings on this examination, warrant a thorough investigation. The blood tests will rule out reversible causes. The MRI will help us assess the structure of your brain and identify any potential abnormalities. I understand your anxiety, but it's important to have a clear understanding of what's happening. I'll schedule the tests immediately. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to arrange the MRI. And I'll forward my referral to Dr. Evans, a highly respected neurologist in the area. He'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to maintain a regular routine, get adequate sleep, and avoid any activities that cause excessive stress. Do not self-diagnose or rely on information you find online. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Routine… sleep… don't self-diagnose… What if… what if it is something serious? What if it's… Alzheimer's? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: It is too early to speculate on a diagnosis, Ms. Heidenthal. Worrying prematurely will not be productive. We will gather the necessary information and proceed accordingly. The results of the tests will provide clarity. I will provide you with a copy of my findings and the neurologist’s contact information. In the meantime, focus on maintaining your current lifestyle. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness, contact my office immediately. My nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. .
