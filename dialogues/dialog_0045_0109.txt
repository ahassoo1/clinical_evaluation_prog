DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Head…back of head hurts. Been hurting for…a little while now. Not all the time, but…yeah. Hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little while now… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Maybe…two weeks? No, maybe longer. Hard to say. It comes and goes. Not…sharp pain. More like…heavy. Like someone is pushing on the back of my head. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And how often would you say it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm…most days now, I think. But not all the time. Like…sometimes it’s there when I wake up. And then it goes away for a little bit. And then comes back. Not every hour, not every minute. Just…comes and goes. I work, you see. Rail yard. It can be…loud. Maybe that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Loud noises, yes. Definitely. And…when I bend over. If I try to pick something up off the floor, it gets worse. Also…when I’m tired. Long days at work, lots of bending and lifting…it’s bad then. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: No…not really. Maybe…a little dizzy sometimes? But I get dizzy easy. Old man, you know. I don't think that’s from the head. Just…balance is not what it used to be. No blurry vision, no…tingling. Just the head hurts. And I’m tired. Always tired. But that's from the work, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I'm going to do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to check your reflexes, your balance, and just see how you're moving. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. That’s…good. You check. Whatever you need. Just want the head to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Everything seems…normal, for your age. Your reflexes are a little slow, and your balance is a bit unsteady, but that’s not uncommon. Now, I want to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood pressure. Yes, that sounds good. Just…please, make it quick. I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little high, which we should keep an eye on. Your heart and lungs sound okay, and everything else seems…within normal limits for your age. Given your history and the symptoms you've described, it’s likely this is a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by your work and stress. However, given your age and elevated blood pressure, I want to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: “Tension headache”? What…is that? Is that bad? And what about the blood pressure? Should I worry about that? And the work…can I still work? I need the money.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. A tension headache is a common type of headache. It’s usually caused by muscle tightness in your neck and shoulders. It's not usually dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which means your heart is working harder than it should. We need to monitor it and make sure it doesn’t get too high. As for work… yes, you can continue working, but we need to discuss some things to help manage your symptoms and blood pressure. First, I’m going to prescribe you a pain reliever for the headache. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to check your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Pain reliever…okay. That sounds good. But…I don’t have insurance. How much does it cost? And what if it doesn't help? And two weeks…is that a long time to wait? What if the blood pressure gets worse?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I understand your concerns. Since you don't have insurance, we can look at some options to help you afford the medication. There are some programs that offer financial assistance, and I'll help you find one. The pain reliever is relatively inexpensive, and there are generic options available. We'll start with a low dose, and if it doesn't help, we can try something else. As for the blood pressure, I want you to monitor it at home if possible. I can show you how to do that, and we can adjust your medication accordingly. And yes, two weeks is a bit of a wait, but it's important to get a baseline reading and see how your blood pressure is responding to treatment. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No. I don’t have one of those. Never had one. I just…I work. Hard work. And then I come home and I sleep. That’s all. I don’t know anything about…blood pressure. Or medicine. You have to explain everything very slowly, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. This is a blood pressure cuff. It’s a small device that you wear on your arm to measure your blood pressure. It’s not very expensive, and you can buy one at most pharmacies. I can write you a prescription for one, and we can see if your insurance will cover it. If not, I can help you find a low-cost option. It’s important to monitor your blood pressure at home because it can fluctuate throughout the day. I'll show you how to use it, and we can keep track of your readings. Now, let's talk about some other things you can do to manage your symptoms and blood pressure. First, it's important to get regular exercise. I know you work hard, but try to find some time to go for a walk or do some light stretching. And it's also important to eat a healthy diet. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Exercise…that sounds hard. And I like my food. I eat what I can. Whatever is available. It’s not easy, you see. Rail yard work…long hours. Little money. Everything is hard. So…what if I can’t do all of this? What if I just keep working and hope it gets better? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. I understand. It's not easy, and you're right, it takes effort. You don’t have to do everything at once. We can start small. Just try to walk for 10 minutes a day, and maybe cut back on sugary drinks. As for the food, just try to eat a little more fruit and vegetables. Every little bit helps. And no, it's not okay to just hope it gets better. High blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, like heart attack and stroke. That’s why it’s important to monitor it and take steps to manage it. Now, I’m going to prescribe you a low dose pain reliever for the headache and write you a prescription for a blood pressure cuff. We’ll check your readings in two weeks and adjust your treatment accordingly. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss your symptoms and progress. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Two weeks. And the medicine. And the cuff. Yes. I can try. But…what if I forget? I forget things sometimes, you see. Old man. What if I forget to take the medicine? Or forget to check the blood pressure? What then? Will something bad happen?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. That’s a valid concern. Forgetting things is normal, especially as we get older. We can create a plan to help you remember. First, I’m going to write down the instructions for the medicine and blood pressure checks. We’ll also set a reminder on your phone, if you have one. If you don’t have a phone, we can use a calendar and write down the dates and times. I also recommend asking a family member or friend to help you remember. If you forget to take the medicine or check your blood pressure, don’t worry. Just take it as soon as you remember. If you’re still concerned, we can schedule a follow-up appointment sooner than two weeks. Now, let's write down the instructions. You take one pain reliever twice a day, with food. And you check your blood pressure once a day, in the morning, before you eat. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay. Twice a day. With food. And in the morning. Yes. I can try to remember. But…asking someone to help…I don’t like to ask for help. I always do things myself. I don’t want to be a burden. Is it okay if I just try to remember on my own? For now? Maybe…maybe I can manage it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. I understand. You don't have to ask for help if you don’t want to. It's your decision. But I want you to know that I’m here to support you, and I’m happy to help you with anything you need. If you change your mind, just let me know. Now, let's focus on the instructions for the medicine and blood pressure checks. We'll write them down clearly, and you can keep them with you. And I'll give you a list of resources where you can find more information about managing your blood pressure. Now, let's review the instructions one more time. You take one pain reliever twice a day, with food, and you check your blood pressure once a day, in the morning, before you eat. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Twice a day. With food. Morning. Yes. I think…I think I understand. The blood pressure…how do I read the numbers? What do they mean? If the number is high…what do I do? Do I call you? What if it’s very, very high? Will I…will something bad happen?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. That's a great question. Let's talk about the numbers. A blood pressure reading has two numbers. The top number is called systolic pressure, and it measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom number is called diastolic pressure, and it measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests. A normal blood pressure reading is around 120/80. Anything above 140/90 is considered high. Now, if your blood pressure reading is high, don't panic. Just take a few deep breaths and try to relax. Check it again in a few minutes. If it's still high, call me. If it's very, very high, like above 180/120, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Will something bad happen?
PATIENT: 120 over 80…and 180 over 120…those numbers…they don't mean anything to me. They're just…numbers. If I get scared…if I feel bad…what do I do? What if I'm alone? What if something happens and I can’t call anyone? Is there a number I can call…just someone to talk to? Someone who understands old people? This is…too much. Maybe I should just go back to work and forget about all of this. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It's a lot of information, and it's perfectly normal to be scared. This card has the number for a senior support hotline. You can call them anytime, day or night, and they can talk to you about your concerns and help you find resources in the community. They understand old people, as you say. They can even help you create a plan to manage your blood pressure and schedule appointments. You're not alone in this, Mr. Brum. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, let’s just focus on getting the medicine and the blood pressure cuff. And remember, you can call me anytime if you have questions or concerns. How about we schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today?
PATIENT: Okay. Two weeks. And the number…I will remember the number. Thank you, Doctor. You…you have been very patient. It’s…it’s a lot to think about. But…thank you. I will try my best. Now…I think I should go home. And…rest. Yes. Rest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. You take care now. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I'll see you in two weeks. Here’s the prescription for the pain reliever and the blood pressure cuff.
