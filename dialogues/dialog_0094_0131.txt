DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's lovely to meet you. Why don't we start with what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Gegan. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my regular doctor told me to come get it checked out by someone here. He just wanted a second opinion, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. A second opinion is always a good idea. So, your regular doctor noticed your blood pressure was elevated and recommended you come in for further evaluation. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it being high, and if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it was probably around, oh, maybe March? My regular doctor checks it every time I go, and he didn't say anything for a long time. Then, at the appointment in March, he mentioned it was a little higher than usual, but not to worry too much. He wanted to see it again next time, and then this time he said I should get it checked out here. Symptoms... not really. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but I always get headaches. And sometimes I feel a little tired, but who doesn't? I haven't been feeling sick or anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Sladen. Headaches and fatigue are very common and don't necessarily point to anything specific. It’s good that your doctor is being proactive. So, to clarify, your blood pressure started to trend upwards around March, and it's been gradually increasing since then, prompting the referral?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Gradually increasing, you got it. He didn't seem too worried, honestly. Just wanted to make sure everything was okay, since my family... well, my grandfather had some heart problems. I think that's why he's being extra careful.
DOCTOR: That's very good information about your grandfather’s history – family history is important. And it’s wise of your doctor to be cautious. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your own medical background?
PATIENT: Sure. I don't have a lot, thankfully. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. But nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was little, and I broke my wrist once playing netball, but that was ages ago. Other than that... not much. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I have Medicare, if that's what you need to know. I don't go to the doctor much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sladen. That's helpful to know. No major medical history is good. And yes, knowing you have Medicare is useful for billing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. I try to stay away from pills if I can help it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. Just the regular one you get at the pharmacy. And honestly, I forget to take it half the time. I don't really like taking anything unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And no known allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of food, wear any kind of jewelry... I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. My mom always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Sladen. No allergies simplifies things considerably. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Okay. Well, I work as a… it’s hard to explain exactly. I help people with personal care, you know, things like getting dressed or helping with meals if they need it. It’s pretty physical, actually, lots of walking around. I'm on my feet most of the day. I live alone, in an apartment in town. I don’t really have any bad habits, I don't smoke, barely drink. I used to go dancing a lot, but haven't been in ages. It's hard to find the time, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds like a demanding job, being on your feet all day. It’s good to hear you don’t smoke and only drink occasionally. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me approximately how much water you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Probably not enough, to be honest. I usually have a cup of tea with my breakfast, and maybe a glass of water with lunch. And sometimes I'll have a bottle of water when I'm at work, if I remember. But I don’t really make a point of drinking water all day. I'm terrible at it, I know. I should probably be better about that.
DOCTOR: It’s very honest of you to say that, Ms. Sladen. Many people don't drink enough water. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and measure your blood pressure. Then, I’ll take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctor visits, even if I don't enjoy them much. Hopefully everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a listen… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, good air entry. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Alright, everything sounds and looks good physically, but that blood pressure reading is a bit elevated. It confirms what your doctor suspected. Do you feel comfortable with me ordering some basic blood work and a urine test?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. A bit elevated… so it's not terrible? I get a little worried when people say things are “elevated.” But if you think it’s a good idea to do the blood work and urine test, then yeah, go ahead. I trust your judgment. What exactly will those tests show?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Sladen. "Elevated" simply means it's higher than the ideal range, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We want to investigate why it’s elevated. The blood work will check your kidney function, electrolytes, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. It will also give us information about your overall health. The urine test will look for protein, sugar, and signs of infection. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for the high blood pressure and ensure there's no damage to your kidneys. It’s a routine process, and we'll get the results back in a few days. Based on those results, we can discuss the best course of action, which may involve lifestyle changes, medication, or further testing. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. Checking for all sorts of things… that’s good. I'd rather know what's going on, even if it’s not good news. So, kidney function and stuff... good. And then you'll tell me what it all means? And talk about what to do next? Okay. That sounds like a plan. How do I go about getting those tests done? Do I need an appointment somewhere?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We'll get all the information we need to determine the best path forward. I’m going to give you a lab requisition form with a list of the tests. There’s a lab just down the street – [Lab Name and Address]. You can go there anytime during their business hours – they don't require an appointment. Just bring your Medicare card and this form. They will draw some blood and collect a urine sample. The results will be sent directly to me. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It usually takes 3-5 business days for the results to come back. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: Okay, 3-5 business days... I can wait that long. And I just take this form and my Medicare card to [Lab Name and Address], right? No appointment needed. That’s good. No, I think that’s everything. You said they'll send the results straight to you. So, I don't have to do anything after I go to the lab? Thank you, Dr. Gegan. You've explained everything really clearly. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on and what to do next.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sladen. That's exactly what I'm here for. Yes, you are correct – once you've taken the form and had the tests done, you don't need to do anything further. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Have a good day, Ms. Sladen. And remember to stay hydrated! .
