DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually bother doctors with… these sorts of things, but I felt I really ought to get it checked. It’s about… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. And it’s… from him. My… companion. Not me, of course! I would never…
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to discuss these things, but you’ve come to the right place, Ms. Wartick. It’s good you’re getting it checked. To clarify, you’re concerned about a discharge coming from your… companion?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. My… gentleman friend. He’s a bit… private, you understand, and doesn’t like doctors much. But it’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… concerning. It’s not a lot, mind you, but it’s definitely there. And it… smells. Not a pleasant odor at all, I assure you. I’m quite fastidious about cleanliness, and this is simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like you’re understandably concerned about this, and it’s good you’re being proactive. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about your companion?
PATIENT: Well… he’s… a bit older than me, naturally. A gentleman. Keeps himself tidy, usually. A bit of a homebody, really. Doesn't go out much. He's… particular about his routines. And, frankly, Doctor, I don't think he's been entirely… faithful, if you understand my meaning. Though he'd never admit it, of course! It’s just… a feeling I have. And I suspect that might have something to do with all of this. I do try to keep things… respectable, but one can only do so much, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there's some complexity to the situation. To clarify, when you say "not entirely faithful," are you aware of any specific instances or potential exposures that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Well, no, not specifically. It’s more… a sense. He gets little gifts sometimes. Odd trinkets. And he spends rather a lot of time locked in the shed. He says he’s… working on his hobbies, but… honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit suspicious. He’s very secretive about what goes on in there. And there have been… noises. Unidentifiable noises. I don’t pry, you understand, but it’s hardly the sort of thing a gentleman of his age should be doing. It’s all very unsettling. I try not to think about it, but… it does cross my mind. A lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like you’re understandably worried about your companion’s activities and how they might be contributing to this discharge. To help me determine the best course of action, could you describe the discharge itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… yellowish, mostly. Sometimes a bit greenish, I think. Not a bright color, thankfully. It’s… thick, you see? Not watery, certainly. And it has a… rather strong smell. A bit fishy, perhaps? Though I’m not entirely sure. It’s not constant, mind you. It comes and goes. More noticeable after… well, after he's been in the shed. And it stains, you see? It stains his… underthings. Which is terribly inconvenient, I assure you. I've tried various detergents, but nothing seems to get it out completely. It’s simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wartick. That's very helpful. Given the color, consistency, and odor you've described, and the association with time spent in the shed, I’m starting to form a picture. Before we go any further, I need to ask a direct question, and I want to assure you that I’m asking this for medical reasons only. Is your companion… a dog?
PATIENT: A… a dog? Doctor, are you suggesting…? Well, I never! Of course not! He’s a gentleman! A perfectly respectable, if somewhat eccentric, gentleman! He… he enjoys gardening, that’s all! And he has… sensitive skin! Is that what you’re implying? Honestly, I’m quite shocked. I came to you for help, not… accusations! This is highly unprofessional, I must say!
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Wartick, allow me to apologize if I’ve offended you. I assure you, I meant no disrespect. The information you provided – the discharge, the secretive shed visits, the staining – led me to consider a possible zoonotic cause, specifically a urinary tract infection or other infection in a canine companion. It was a line of inquiry, and I apologize for not framing it more sensitively. It's important to rule out all possibilities to provide the correct treatment. Can you confirm if your companion is, in fact, a human?
PATIENT: Well! Finally. Yes, Doctor. He is a human. A perfectly normal, if somewhat… peculiar, human. Though I suppose everyone has their quirks. He simply prefers his privacy. And the shed is his workshop! He builds… things. I don't ask. Really. It's better that way. He's a bit… sensitive about it. And the noises? Probably just the tools. Though I still don't entirely understand what he's making. But it's not a dog! A dog would never wear tweed! And he drinks tea! Tea, Doctor! Do dogs drink tea? I think not! Honestly, the very idea is… preposterous. Now, are we going to discuss the actual problem, or are you going to continue questioning my companion's species?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Wartick. My apologies again for the line of questioning. It was a misstep on my part. Let's focus on your companion. You mentioned he's experiencing a discharge. Can you tell me about any other symptoms he's experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… he’s been a bit… withdrawn lately. More so than usual, if that’s possible. And he seems… uncomfortable. He winces sometimes when he… uses the facilities. And he’s been drinking more tea, which is odd. He always liked a single cup in the afternoon, but lately it’s been two, even three! And he's been… fidgety. Constantly adjusting his trousers, if you understand me. And there was that one incident… he complained of a burning sensation, he said. But he wouldn't elaborate. He's a very private man, you see. And he refuses to see a doctor himself. Says he doesn't trust them. That’s why I’m here. It’s all very… worrying. And frankly, quite unseemly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wartick. The withdrawal, discomfort, increased frequency, fidgeting, and burning sensation are all important details. Given these symptoms, and the fact that he’s unwilling to see a doctor directly, I suspect we should consider a possible urinary tract infection, or perhaps something related to a sexually transmitted infection, even if he’s reluctant to discuss the details. To proceed, and to be as respectful of your companion as possible, I’d like to collect a urine sample. Would that be possible?
PATIENT: A… a urine sample? From him? Doctor, that’s… that’s rather intrusive, isn’t it? He would be mortified. Absolutely mortified. I don’t know if I can… I mean, he’s a very modest man. And I’m not sure I have the… the facilities to collect such a sample discreetly. It’s all very… delicate. Perhaps we could… simply prescribe something? A general antibiotic, perhaps? Something to cover all bases? I’m sure it can’t hurt, and it would save us a great deal of embarrassment. Honestly, the thought of having to… procure a sample… it’s simply unthinkable. It’s just… not done.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick. You’re right to prioritize your companion’s dignity and comfort. However, prescribing antibiotics without a proper diagnosis isn't advisable. It can lead to antibiotic resistance and may not address the underlying issue. To minimize any discomfort, I can provide you with sterile collection containers and detailed instructions. You can collect the sample at home, and it doesn't need to be done under any specific medical supervision. We can also discuss strategies to ensure privacy and discretion. Alternatively, if obtaining a sample at home proves too difficult, we can explore the possibility of a referral to a specialist who may be better equipped to handle this situation with sensitivity. What would you feel more comfortable with?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is all so… complicated. A referral to a specialist… that sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. He hates going to new places. And he’s so particular about his routine… No, no, that won’t do at all. Very well. The containers… and instructions. You say it doesn’t need… supervision? He wouldn't want anyone… watching. And it has to be discreet. Absolutely discreet. I can… I can try. But I make no promises. He's a very stubborn man. And easily flustered. And if he refuses… well, I don’t know what I’ll do. But I suppose it’s better than nothing. Just… please, make the instructions very clear. And simple. He's not very good with… technology. Or anything remotely complicated, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I understand. I’ll make sure the instructions are very clear and simple, with illustrations. They’ll explain how to collect a “clean-catch” midstream sample – this is the most accurate type for testing. And I’ll include information on proper storage and transportation. I’ll also write down my direct phone number should you have any questions or encounter any difficulties. Here you are. And please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We’ll do our best to accommodate your companion’s needs and ensure his comfort. In the meantime, can you tell me if he has any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. He’s always been rather… robust, you see. Doesn't get sick easily. But… he did have a reaction once. Years ago. To… chamomile tea. Yes, chamomile tea. He broke out in a rash. A rather unsightly rash. And he sneezed incessantly for days. So, chamomile. Definitely chamomile. And… he doesn’t like penicillin. He says it gives him indigestion. Though I’m not sure if that’s a true allergy or just a… preference. He’s very particular about his stomach, you see. And… that’s all I can think of. He doesn’t take any regular medications. He prefers home remedies. Mostly… herbal teas. Except for the chamomile, of course. And… he dislikes the smell of lavender. Just a… personal aversion. It doesn’t hurt him, but he finds it… unsettling. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wartick. That’s all very helpful. We’ll note the chamomile allergy and the aversion to lavender in his chart. The penicillin and the general stomach sensitivity are also good to know. To summarize, we’ll proceed with attempting to collect a urine sample for analysis, keeping in mind his preference for privacy and his sensitivities. Once we have the results, we can determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For being… understanding. And for not… judging. It's been… a rather difficult conversation. And I do appreciate your discretion. I hope… I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. He’s not a well man. And I worry about him. Very much. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to go and… prepare. For the… collection process. It’s not going to be easy. Thank you again, Doctor. And… good day.
