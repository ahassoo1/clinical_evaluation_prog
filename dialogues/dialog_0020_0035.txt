DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Beinborn. Nice to meet you as well. Oh, it’s these hiccups, really. They just won’t stop. Started yesterday, and they're still going strong. It's a bit silly coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they're… persistent, let's say that.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups can be quite bothersome, Mirriam. It's good you came in. It’s not silly at all to seek medical attention when something is interfering with your daily life. Yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. Around lunchtime, I think. I was having a little bit of tuna salad on white bread – don’t judge me, it’s a comfort! – and then hiccup. And then another. And another. I figured it'd pass, you know? But here I am. I haven't been able to sleep properly either, keeps waking me up.
DOCTOR: No judgement at all about the tuna salad, Mirriam! Comfort foods are important. And sleep disruption definitely makes things worse. Okay, so it started with the lunch yesterday and has continued since then. Have you tried anything to get rid of them – holding your breath, drinking water quickly, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything I could think of. Holding my breath until my face turned red, drinking water upside down, even a spoonful of sugar. My grandson, little Kaito, told me about the sugar trick. Didn't work for me, unfortunately. My daughter suggested a paper bag, but I felt quite foolish breathing into that. It just feels like they’re stuck.
DOCTOR: You've certainly tried a lot of the common remedies! It sounds like these hiccups are quite resistant. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Not sure I've noticed anything specific making them worse, honestly. Maybe… getting excited? Talking on the phone seems to bring them on sometimes. But that might just be coincidence. It’s hard to pinpoint. Eating doesn’t seem to matter, drinking doesn't either. Oh! And if I bend over quickly, definitely. That's a surefire way to trigger a whole string of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so excitement, talking on the phone, and bending over seem to be triggers. And eating and drinking don’t consistently cause them. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the hiccups – any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or heartburn?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And my breathing is fine, thankfully. No nausea either. I had a little bit of heartburn last night, but I think that was just the spicy curry my daughter brought over. It wasn't anything too bad. Just a little bit of a burning feeling. That curry was good, though. Worth the heartburn, almost.
DOCTOR: Curry is good enough to risk a little heartburn, I understand! Alright, so no significant symptoms besides the hiccups and some mild heartburn. Now, to get a little more background… Do you have any history of medical problems – anything you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had my gallbladder removed years ago, must be… thirty years now? And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, you know? I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No diabetes, no high blood pressure. My doctor always said I had a strong heart.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Gallbladder removal thirty years ago, pneumonia in the past, and generally good health otherwise. Any family history of similar issues - hiccups that won't go away, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we didn’t really talk about medical things much. Lots of stoicism, you know? My mother, she had a touch of arthritis, and my brother, he had some problems with his nerves later in life, but nothing like… chronic hiccups. Nobody I recall ever being bothered by these things for this long. I do remember my grandmother used to get little spasms sometimes, but nothing persistent. More like a twitch.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no strong family history of persistent hiccups or neurological conditions. Now, I’m going to ask about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one prescription, really. For my arthritis, a little something called… let me see… Celecoxib, I think it's called. A small dose, just to keep the stiffness at bay. And sometimes I take paracetamol for aches and pains, when needed. Oh, and a multivitamin every morning, you know, to keep things ticking along. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. No reactions to anything I can recall. My daughter always checks when she brings me new foods, just to be safe, but I’ve never had a problem. I can eat pretty much anything. Except for maybe oysters, but that's just a personal preference!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Mirriam, let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs and a brief abdominal exam. Then we can talk about what might be causing these hiccups and what we can do about them. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I'm happy to cooperate. It’s a bit of a bother, these hiccups, so I'm glad to be getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay, lungs sound good, heart sounds regular. Now I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and not tender. Anything feel painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt at all, Doctor. Not a bit. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. Just the usual gurgling sounds, you know? I had a big lunch yesterday, might be leftover noises from that! Everything feels pretty much as it should, honestly. I’m a bit surprised, I expected something to be amiss.
DOCTOR: That’s good news, Mirriam. No obvious signs of anything concerning on the exam. Given your history and the physical exam, these persistent hiccups seem to be… idiopathic, meaning we don't have an obvious cause. Sometimes they just happen. However, we do want to rule out a few other possibilities, just to be safe. I'd like to order a simple blood test – just to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying metabolic issues. It’s a routine precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then yes, absolutely. A blood test sounds perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's causing these pesky hiccups. I trust your judgment. It's a relief to know it's not something serious, at least. And if it’s just… idiopathic, well, I suppose I can live with that. As long as they eventually stop!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the lab order sent over now. It should be a quick draw, and the results usually come back within a day or two. In the meantime, we can try a medication that sometimes helps to calm the hiccup reflex. It's called Baclofen, a muscle relaxant. It’s often used for spasms and can sometimes be effective for persistent hiccups. Are you comfortable with trying that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If it might help, then yes, please. I’m willing to try anything at this point! I’m getting rather tired of these hiccups, to be honest. Baclofen, you say? I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to give it a try. What are the side effects like, if you don't mind me asking? I like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Baclofen can cause some drowsiness, dizziness, and sometimes muscle weakness. It's important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel these effects. Less commonly, some people experience nausea or constipation. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you experience any bothersome side effects, we can adjust the dosage or discontinue the medication. I’ll write you a prescription for 5mg of Baclofen, to be taken three times a day. Let's try this for a week and see if it makes a difference. If the hiccups continue after a week, or if you experience any significant side effects, please give the office a call and we can discuss other options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Drowsiness and dizziness… I can manage those, I think. I don't drive anymore, thankfully, and I’m mostly just puttering around the house. Puttering and hiccuping, that's my current routine! 5mg three times a day, you say? Alright, I’ll take it as prescribed. And I’ll definitely give you a call if anything feels amiss. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor Beinborn. I’m feeling a bit more optimistic now, knowing we’re at least trying something.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right to be optimistic; we’re taking a proactive step. I'll also send the lab order to the lab. They can draw your blood anytime. We can review the results when they come back. Here’s a printout of my notes and the prescription instructions, just in case you forget anything. Also, I'll have the nurse give you a handout with more information about Baclofen. I want you to know that if the hiccups worsen, or if you develop any other concerning symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. You've put my mind at ease. I’ll get the blood work done tomorrow, and I’ll start the Baclofen as soon as I can. And I’ll definitely keep you informed of how things are going. Thank you again for everything. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if I’ve forgotten anything! My memory isn’t what it used to be. I think I have everything. You have a lovely day, Doctor Beinborn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t worry about forgetting things – that's perfectly normal. We're here to help, and we'll make sure you get the care you need. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and I hope the hiccups subside soon. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. I will, thank you. And I certainly hope so as well! Goodbye now.
