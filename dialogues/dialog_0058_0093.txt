DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. So, you’re here today…what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s right. Redfern. Look, honestly? I dunno exactly. The wife… well, she always handled these things. Said I needed to… optimize. Something about sleep and…being less floppy, I think? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. She always liked things neat and tidy, even my health.
DOCTOR: Optimize…right. And “less floppy”?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s what she said. Said I was…lacking tone. Like a…a bad instrument. Honestly, it was probably just her being fussy. She was a musician, you see. Very particular about everything being… just so. I just want to be able to get a decent night’s rest, if that’s possible. And maybe not feel like I’ve been run over by a truck every morning. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Well, let's try to figure it out. So, you’re experiencing fatigue and…decreased muscle tone, is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Decreased muscle tone…fancy words. Yeah, alright. I guess. Look, I wouldn't say I'm exactly robust, if that’s what you mean. I used to be… stronger, I suppose. But that was a long time ago. And yes, tired. Always tired. It’s just… life, isn’t it? Though she'd argue it was something fixable. She always had to have a reason for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, definitely. Maybe… since she… passed? It's hard to say. Everything sort of blurred together after that. I stopped keeping track of things, to be honest. The days just… run into each other. She always kept the schedule, the appointments, everything. I just…did the repairs. Guitars, violins… whatever needed fixing. Didn’t really pay attention to much else.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue for several months, potentially worsening after the loss of your wife. Any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I get… winded easily. Even walking up the stairs, which is ridiculous. And my appetite's been off. I haven't been eating much, to be honest. Not that I ever had a huge appetite, but… less now. And… sometimes I just feel… off. Like I’m not quite… here, if you know what I mean? A bit foggy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. And the weight loss – have you noticed how much weight you've lost, approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. Clothes are a bit looser, I suppose. The wife used to complain I was getting… substantial. Said it was a health hazard. Now… well, I just wear what still fits. Probably a good bit, if I’m being honest. I haven't stepped on a scale in ages. She always monitored that too. This is all a bit… much, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, to get a better understanding, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. Just routine things, okay?
PATIENT: Listen to my… lungs? Is something wrong with my lungs? The wife always said I had a perfectly good set of lungs, good for a bellow. Look, I’m not opposed to a quick look, but I don’t want any… unpleasant surprises. I’ve never been fond of doctors poking around. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Redfern. Just to rule things out. We'll start with your blood pressure. 110 over 70. A bit on the lower side, but nothing alarming. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath… Breath sounds are a little diminished bilaterally. And your heart rate is 68, regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… but slightly decreased muscle mass. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Diminished… what now? And muscle mass? I told you, I'm not exactly a picture of health. Always preferred tinkering with instruments to lifting weights. Bracing myself. See? Not exactly sprightly. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something seriously wrong? The wife always said I was prone to… delicate constitutions.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m checking your reflexes and your muscle strength. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. Squeeze my hand, please. Grip strength is… weaker than expected. And you appear to have some mild postural instability. All of this, combined with your fatigue, weight loss, and decreased appetite, is concerning. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a Vitamin D level. We also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, so I’m ordering an EKG. I suspect something more than just a “delicate constitution” is going on here.
PATIENT: EKG… cardiac issues… good heavens. This is all rather… dramatic, isn't it? The wife always said I worried too much. Said I was a hypochondriac. So, blood work, heart tests… what exactly are you looking for? Is it… serious? Is it going to require… poking and prodding? I really don't like hospitals. And I certainly don’t like being told I'm not as robust as I used to be. Can’t it just be… stress? Or lack of sleep? Perhaps a new pillow?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your anxiety, but dismissing these symptoms as simply “stress” or “lack of sleep” would be irresponsible. Your symptoms – the fatigue, weight loss, diminished reflexes, weak grip strength, postural instability, and reduced appetite – point to a potentially serious underlying issue. We need to investigate thoroughly to determine the cause. The blood work will help us identify any deficiencies, infections, or organ dysfunction. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm and identify any abnormalities. I'm not saying it is serious, but we need to rule out the possibilities. I will refer you to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation. It's best to be proactive and get a definitive diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend you maintain a detailed food diary, noting everything you eat and drink. Also, try to get as much rest as possible, but don’t self-medicate with sleeping pills without consulting me first. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests in one week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… a whole week of worrying and waiting. And a cardiologist… that sounds terribly serious. The wife would have handled all of this. She always knew what to do. A food diary… really? I barely remember what I ate yesterday. And sleeping pills? I haven’t slept properly in months, even with a decent pillow. Alright. Fine. A week. Food diary. Cardiologist. Whatever you think is best. But please… try to be gentle. I’m not exactly built for poking and prodding. And… could you perhaps explain everything in layman’s terms? I don’t understand all the… medical jargon. Just… tell me what’s wrong, in plain English. That’s all I ask. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. I will explain everything in plain English. I’ll also ensure the cardiologist takes a gentle approach. We’re going to investigate potential causes for your symptoms. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities, such as underlying cardiac issues, neurological disorders, or even endocrine problems. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Here’s the referral to the cardiologist and the food diary form. Please schedule an appointment with the cardiologist as soon as possible. And remember to keep a detailed record of everything you eat and drink. I understand this is overwhelming, but it’s important to be proactive and address these symptoms. I will be here to guide you through this process. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
