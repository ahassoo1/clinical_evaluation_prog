DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too. I’m here because… well, I have cancer. It’s been… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be incredibly difficult to process. I'm very sorry to hear that, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand your situation better, and how I can best support you, could you tell me a little more about when you were diagnosed, and what type of cancer you have, if you know?
PATIENT: Um… it was… last November, I think. November 15th. And… it's in my… chest. The doctor said… lung cancer. But… I don't really understand all the details. They used a lot of big words. It's… stage two, I believe. I remember that part.
DOCTOR: Okay, November 15th, stage two lung cancer. That's good you remember that part – it's a lot to take in, and those medical terms can be confusing. Don't feel bad about not understanding everything. To clarify, was this diagnosis made here at our clinic, or by another doctor?
PATIENT: It was… at the hospital in town. Dr. Miller. He… he was the one who told me. He… he also said I should see someone for… help with things. With… after the treatments. That’s why I’m here. I don't… I don’t know what kind of help I need, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Miller at the hospital. That’s helpful to know. It sounds like Dr. Miller recommended you come see me to discuss supportive care options after your treatments – which is excellent. That's exactly what I specialize in – Internal Medicine, focusing on helping patients manage the side effects of cancer treatment and improve their quality of life. Just to get a clearer picture, have you started treatment yet, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I finished my fourth round of chemotherapy last week. It’s… really tiring. And… I feel sick a lot. My husband… he used to help. But… he passed away in April. So… it's just been me since then.
DOCTOR: I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That is a tremendous loss, and to be going through cancer treatments on top of that… it's just unimaginable. It's understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. You mentioned feeling tired and sick a lot. Could you tell me more about the sickness?
PATIENT: It's… mostly nausea. I throw up sometimes. And… I don't have much of an appetite. Everything tastes… funny. And… I get really weak. Just… walking to the bathroom is hard some days. It started getting worse after the third round, I think. Before that… it was bad, but… manageable. Now… it’s hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, worsening nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite with altered taste, and increasing weakness, particularly after the third chemotherapy round. That definitely sounds like treatment-related side effects, and it’s good we're talking about this. To get a fuller picture, I’d like to ask you some more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any other significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I… I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the chickenpox when I was a little girl, and… I broke my arm once. But… nothing serious. No… diabetes, or heart problems, or anything like that. I don’t take any medications… except the anti-nausea pills the doctor gave me. But they don't really help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No other major medical problems, just the anti-nausea medication which isn’t providing adequate relief. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother… on my mother’s side… she had breast cancer. A long time ago. She… she’s passed away now. And… my uncle… he had some kind of… lung problem. But I don’t really know the details. My mother… she’s okay. Healthy. As far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother with breast cancer and an uncle with a lung problem. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… well, before… before my husband… we used to go hiking a lot. I like being outdoors. But… now I mostly stay inside. I don't… I don’t have much energy. I don't smoke. I… I never have. And… I don't drink much. Just… a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Before… all of this. Now… not so much. I eat… what I can. Mostly soup. And… crackers. It's hard to eat when I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, previously active with hiking, non-smoker, occasional wine drinker, and now limited activity with a restricted diet due to feeling unwell. Before we move on, and to make sure I have a complete picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I’ve never had any… bad reactions to anything. I can eat anything. I… I don’t have any… food allergies. Or… anything like that. Never had a problem with… penicillin, or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, Chellsea, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me assess how you’re doing overall. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… okay. I guess. Whatever you need to do. I… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, 100/60, which can be common with chemotherapy. Your pulse is regular, at 72. Your lungs are clear to auscultation, meaning I don't hear any unusual sounds. I did notice you appear a little thin, and your skin feels dry, which is also common with the treatment and reduced appetite. I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. It's… a little sore, maybe. But… not pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like… a dull ache. It’s been like that… for a few weeks. It doesn't really bother me… too much. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the abdomen. That could be related to the chemotherapy or simply be a result of reduced intake. I’m also going to check your reflexes. And your strength. Everything seems relatively normal so far, but I would like to order some blood work just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It will help us assess your kidney and liver function, check your electrolytes, and see if you're anemic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… know what’s wrong. And… hopefully, feel better soon. Blood work… okay.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write the order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to take the samples. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some typical side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and mild dehydration. It’s also understandable that the loss of your husband has taken a tremendous toll on you, and that’s contributing to your overall feeling of unwellness. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss some specific strategies to manage your symptoms, like medication adjustments, dietary recommendations, and supportive care options. Would you be open to trying some anti-nausea medication with a different mechanism of action?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Anything. I… I’ve been trying to… just deal with it. But it’s getting harder. If there’s a different pill… I'll try it. I just… can’t keep throwing up. It’s… embarrassing. And… makes me feel even worse.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s not embarrassing at all – nausea and vomiting are very common side effects of chemotherapy. And you’re absolutely right to seek help – you shouldn't have to deal with that on your own. I'm going to prescribe you Ondansetron, a different type of anti-nausea medication. It works a little differently than what you've been taking, and many patients find it more effective. I'll also give you some tips for managing your diet, such as eating small, frequent meals and avoiding strong-smelling foods. I also want to discuss some other supportive care options that might be helpful. Are you currently seeing a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not. I… I haven’t really thought about it. It’s… hard to talk about things. Especially… after losing my husband. I’m just… trying to get through each day. I haven’t… really felt like talking to anyone. Even my family. They… they mean well. But they don’t really understand. It’s… different. I just… miss him. So much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Chellsea. Grief is a very personal and complex process, and it's completely normal to want to withdraw and cope in your own way. And you’re right, it’s difficult for others to fully understand what you're going through unless they've experienced it themselves. I think it would be beneficial for you to consider connecting with a grief counselor or support group. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to process your emotions and develop coping strategies. I have some resources here that I can share with you. Would you like me to give you some information?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be… helpful. I don’t… I don’t know where to start. But… maybe talking to someone… someone who understands… would be good. I just… I feel so alone. Even when I'm around people. It's… like a weight on my chest. Always. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you need support, and I'm glad you're willing to explore these options. These resources have excellent counselors and groups specifically for individuals dealing with grief and loss. There's no pressure to join anything right away, but it's good to have the information available. Now, to summarise, we’ve discussed your cancer diagnosis and treatment, the side effects you're experiencing, and the importance of supportive care. I’ve prescribed you Ondansetron for the nausea and given you resources for grief counseling. I've also ordered blood work to get a clearer picture of your overall health. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week, once the blood work results are back, to discuss the findings and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A week… okay. I’ll… try to remember. Thank you for everything. You’ve… been very kind. And… you listened. That means… a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. That's my job – to listen and provide the best possible care. And please, don't worry about remembering – we can always send you a reminder. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that’s everything. Thank you again. I should… get going. I have to… pick up some groceries. And… I need to rest. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care of yourself, Chellsea. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. Have a good day.
