DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I’m Courtnye, please. And honestly? It’s my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on… something for my blood, you know, to thin it. It just seems like every little bump now leaves a mark. I'm a bit worried about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. "Something for your blood," you say. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. It’s… Warfarin, I think? The little orange pills. My regular doctor put me on them a while back, but I mostly just… take them. I don’t really keep track of why exactly, just that I need them. Does that make sense? Sorry, I’m not great with remembering all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Warfarin. Yes, that’s a blood thinner, as you said. And you say the bruising is…newly worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. It used to be just a little discoloration if I bumped into something hard, you know? Like, normal. But the last couple of weeks… a small scrape on my arm looked like someone punched me. And I didn’t even feel that hard of a bump, honestly. It's just… concerning. I work with computers all day, so I'm always moving around, and I don’t want to end up looking like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Work's been the same, stressful as always. I haven’t started any new medications, haven’t been sick, nothing like that. Just… the bruising. And maybe I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I'm really not sure. Is this something serious? I just want to get it figured out and go back to work.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be anything immediately serious, but we need to investigate. You're on Warfarin, which, as you know, affects your clotting. It’s…common for people to bruise more easily. But we need to see if it’s within a safe range. Let’s start with a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. See? It's like… everywhere. And it’s not like I’m walking into walls! I'm careful. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to worry about, you know, bleeding out from a papercut or something. That sounds silly, but that’s what I’m scared of.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a papercut isn't going to cause any major issues, Ms. Hainley. But we still need to check your INR. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Deep breath, please. Normal rate and rhythm, lungs are clear. Now, let's just check your abdomen… any pain or tenderness?
PATIENT: No pain, no tenderness. Nothing at all. Just… worried. Look, I appreciate you checking, Doctor, but is this going to take long? I have a deadline at work, and my boss isn't known for being understanding. And honestly, I feel perfectly fine otherwise. I just bruise easily now, which is new. Is it just a blood test then? Can we just get the blood test done?
DOCTOR: Yes, a blood test is necessary. We need to check your INR, as I've mentioned. And frankly, Ms. Hainley, a complete blood count wouldn’t hurt, just to rule out other possibilities. It's a standard procedure when someone on Warfarin reports increased bruising. It's… responsible care. We need to have a full picture, regardless of your deadlines. I'll have the nurse draw some blood now.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. A full blood count. Just… please be quick about it. I really need to get back to work. I just hope this doesn't mean I need to adjust my Warfarin dosage or something. That always seems like a headache.
DOCTOR: We'll discuss that after we have the results, Ms. Hainley. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try to relax.
PATIENT: .
