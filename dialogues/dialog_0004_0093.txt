DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Deschane, right? Yeah, look, honestly, it’s… everything feels a bit off, you know? Not bad, exactly. Just… not right. My wife… she always kept me on a schedule, made sure I was eating properly, exercising. Since… well, since she passed, it’s all gone to pot. I sleep alright, I guess. But I don’t feel rested. And I’m probably… softer around the middle than I used to be. That botherin’ me more than anything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A significant life change like losing your wife can certainly disrupt routines and affect overall well-being. It’s not uncommon to experience changes in sleep, appetite, and energy levels during times of grief. You mentioned feeling “not right” and being concerned about weight gain. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. Could you tell me a little more about this feeling of “not right”?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. It's not… a pain, or anything. Just… sluggish, I suppose. Like I’m wading through mud all the time. And everything feels… pointless, if I'm being honest. I used to spend hours restoring old instruments, meticulous work, you know? Now… I can barely bring myself to tune a simple violin. It's frustrating. I should be enjoying my work, but it feels like a chore. I don't have the… drive anymore, I guess. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Redfern. A loss of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed, coupled with feelings of sluggishness, is definitely something we need to explore further. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember to. My wife always had meals planned, perfectly balanced, you know? Now, I just… grab whatever’s easiest. Biscuits, mostly. And tea. Lots of tea. I wouldn't say I'm hungry all the time, but I don't go without. It’s just… not a priority, I suppose. And honestly, the biscuits are comfortin’. Don’t judge me, doc. It’s a habit. A bad one, probably, but a habit nonetheless.
DOCTOR: I’m not here to judge, Mr. Redfern. Habits are often coping mechanisms, especially during difficult times. It's good you're recognizing it. You mentioned sleep being "alright." Can you describe a typical night for you?
PATIENT: Right, sleep. Yeah, I get… usually six or seven hours. I fall asleep alright enough, watchin' the telly usually 'til I drift off. No trouble gettin’ to sleep. It’s… stayin’ asleep that's the problem sometimes. I wake up a few times, tossin’ and turnin’. Not every night, mind you. But enough to feel it in the mornin’. Just… restless. And I don't really… dream anymore, I don’t think. Or if I do, I don't remember them. It's all a bit blurry, to be honest. Everything feels blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’re getting a clearer picture. Let’s move on to some other things, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any changes in your weight, besides what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, the trousers are tighter, definitely. Used to be able to do 'em up without thinkin’ about it. Now… I gotta loosen the belt a notch or two. I haven’t actually weighed myself recently, to be honest. I try not to. Numbers always bothered my wife, and I’ve kinda… carried that over. It's probably… a stone or two, I reckon. Maybe more. Honestly, doc, I'm not a small man to begin with, you know? I’m a long fella. Always have been. But I'm definitely… wider around the middle than I used to be. Does that answer your question? I’m not good with specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder function?
PATIENT: Ugh, doc, really? Do we have to get into that? Look, I'm an instrument repairer, not a… a medical specimen. Everything's… normal, I suppose. Regular as clockwork, if you must know. Though maybe not as regular as it used to be. A bit slower, perhaps. But nothing… dramatic. Honestly, doc, I’m startin’ to feel like you’re lookin’ for somethin’ serious. Is somethin’ serious wrong? Because if it is, you should just tell me. I don't like beatin' around the bush.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable, Mr. Redfern. I assure you, I'm simply following a standard protocol to gather a comprehensive understanding of your health. You are right to ask directly, and I will be upfront with you. Based on what you've told me – the loss of interest in activities, feelings of sluggishness, changes in sleep and appetite, and some weight gain – it’s important to investigate potential causes, and that includes considering both physical and psychological factors. I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to check some basic vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Physical exam. Fine. Just get on with it, then. I suppose it can't hurt. But don't go pokin' and proddin' too much, alright? I'm a sensitive soul, you know. Used to workin' with delicate instruments, not… medical instruments. And be quick about it. I’ve got a violin needs re-stringin’. A valuable one, too. Don’t want to keep the owner waitin’. So, let's get it over with. But no surprises, alright? Just tell me if somethin’'s wrong. Straight up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. I will be as thorough and efficient as possible. And I will explain everything as we go. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 80 beats per minute. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and again. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll just feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fullness. No tenderness to the touch. Alright. That completes the basic physical exam. Everything appears generally normal, but the elevated blood pressure and some abdominal fullness warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a thyroid function test. I also recommend an ECG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work, ECG… sounds expensive. Look, I'm on Medicare, alright? I don't know if I can afford all that fancy stuff. And honestly, doc, I just feel… tired. All this talkin’ and pokin’ and proddin’… it’s exhausting. I just want to go home and tune a violin. Can't we just… leave it at the blood pressure? Maybe I just need to lay off the biscuits. I'm not a complicated man, doc. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask? And I really, really don’t want to spend a fortune on tests. Can we at least talk about that before you order a whole battery of them?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Mr. Redfern. And you are right to ask. We absolutely need to discuss the necessity and cost of these tests before proceeding. The blood pressure reading is mildly elevated, and while it could be a temporary fluctuation, it's important to rule out any underlying causes. The blood work and ECG will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine if any further intervention is necessary. Given your age and symptoms, it’s also prudent to consider the possibility of a thyroid issue, as that can cause fatigue, weight gain, and changes in mood. The blood work I’m recommending is covered by Medicare, as is the ECG. There should be no out-of-pocket costs to you. However, I understand your reluctance, and we can certainly prioritize. How about this: let's start with the blood work. We can review the results and then decide if the ECG is necessary. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work. Just the blood work, then. Fine. Get it over with. But don’t go sendin’ me to any specialists, alright? I don't want to spend my days traipsin’ around to doctors’ offices. And tell me, straight up, what you’re lookin’ for. Don’t beat around the bush. I want to know what you suspect is wrong with me. And where do I go to get this blood work done? Is it here, at the clinic? I don’t fancy havin’ to travel all over town. I'm a bit of a homebody, you see. I prefer the company of my instruments to the company of… well, people. Especially doctors. No offense, doc. But honestly, I just want to get this over with. The quicker we get this done, the quicker I can get back to my violin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Redfern. We'll start with the blood work. We're looking for several things: a complete blood count to rule out any signs of infection or anemia; a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels; and a thyroid function test to check your thyroid hormone levels. You're right to ask what I suspect. Based on your symptoms – fatigue, weight gain, loss of interest in activities, and changes in sleep – I'm considering several possibilities, including a thyroid issue, early-stage depression, or a vitamin deficiency. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. The lab is right down the hall, Room 203. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, draw the blood. She’s very efficient, and you’ll be in and out quickly. I'll have her give you the requisition form, and you can take it directly to the lab. Once the results are in – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright. Room 203, Sarah. Sounds manageable. A few days, you say? Not too long. Look, doc, I appreciate you explainin’ things. Most doctors just… tell you what’s wrong, without botherin’ with the details. And I'll be honest, I’m still not convinced I need all these tests. But if it gets you off my back, I’ll go get the blood drawn. Just… don’t expect miracles, alright? I’ve always been a bit… melancholy, you see. It’s just part of my nature. I'm an artist, you know? We're supposed to be a bit… dramatic. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go and find Sarah. The sooner this is over, the better. And tell her to be gentle, alright? I bruise easily. A long time ago, I had an accident with a particularly sharp chisel... never quite recovered from it. Thank you, doc. For everything. And if I start feelin’ worse, I’ll be sure to let you know. Now, off I go. Room 203, was it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Room 203. And I’ll make a note for Sarah to be gentle. Have a good day, Mr. Redfern. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
