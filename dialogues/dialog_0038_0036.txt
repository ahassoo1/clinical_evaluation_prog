DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Kiwane. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is... satisfactory to meet you as well. I am here for... the check-up before the insurance begins. Medicare sent me. They said I need to be looked at before they will... cover things. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly right. Medicare often requires a baseline check-up when you first enroll. It's just to get a good understanding of your overall health before coverage kicks in. That’s very sensible. So, this is a comprehensive health assessment then. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: “Going on?” Everything is... normal. I work. I eat. I sleep. Not much goes on. I do not have any... problems. I am a healthy man. What kind of questions are these?
DOCTOR: Right, well that’s excellent to hear! Sometimes "normal" is exactly what we want to find. But even healthy people benefit from a check-up to make sure everything is running smoothly and to catch anything small before it becomes a bigger issue. I'm going to ask a few questions about different parts of your body, just as a routine. It's like a preventative maintenance check for your health. Let's start with this then: have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gained or lost, intentionally or unintentionally?
PATIENT: Weight? No. Not really. I eat the same. Work is hard, so… maybe a little less sometimes. But not much. I am always… this size. It is difficult to gain weight, you know? I have a fast… metabolism, I think. It is a problem, actually. I need to eat much to keep this weight. It is not like some people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, fairly stable weight despite a good appetite and a physically demanding job. That does sound like you might have a naturally faster metabolism. And how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy? I am... tired at the end of the day, naturally. I work with food, it is much lifting and standing. But it is normal tiredness. Not... weak tiredness. I can still do things after work. I watch the football, I go to the market. I am not… falling asleep all the time. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Exactly. That sounds like the normal tiredness that comes with physical work, which is good. We’re just trying to rule things out. Now, let’s talk about your diet a little more specifically. You mentioned working with food – what kind of food do you typically eat throughout the day?
PATIENT: I eat what is available. I work in the processing plant. We handle... many things. Chicken, beef, vegetables. Sometimes I take some home. It is… convenient. I also eat rice, lentils, sometimes fish. My mother cooks sometimes, she makes good stew. It is… basic food. I do not have… fancy tastes. Do you need to know every piece of chicken I eat?
DOCTOR: No, not every piece of chicken! I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. I just want to get a general idea of your eating habits. "Basic food" is perfectly fine – healthy food, even. Just trying to see if you have a balanced diet. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. Have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Not recently. When I was a child, I had… the usual things. Chickenpox, measles, I think. But nothing serious. As an adult… no. I am strong. I do not get sick easily. I had a small… cut at work last year, but it was nothing. They cleaned it and I went back to work. I do not go to the hospital unless it is… very bad. It is expensive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, no significant medical history as an adult. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not take anything. I am a healthy man, I told you. I do not need pills. I eat well, I work hard. That is enough. My mother sometimes gives me… tea with herbs when I have a cold, but that is not a… medication. It is just… tea. It helps with the throat. But I do not rely on it. Is this… necessary? Are you trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not! I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health. I understand your concern, and I apologize if I'm making you feel like I'm looking for something wrong. I'm just being thorough, as I would with any new patient. Okay, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No. Not that I know of. I eat many things. I work with many things. If I was allergic to something, I would know, yes? I have never had… a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… dust sometimes, when I am cleaning. But that is not an… allergy. Just… a little cough. Nothing serious. Are you finished yet? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, nearly finished with the questions, thankfully. Just a few more. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! I do not smoke. It is a terrible habit. Bad for the health. I would never. My father smoked, and he… it was not good. I do not need such things. I have enough problems without putting poison in my body. Next question, please. This is… enough questioning.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, perfectly understood. Last question, I promise. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little. On Fridays, maybe. With my friends. A small beer. Or a glass of wine. Not much. I do not… drink every day. It is not… a habit. It is… social. To relax. It is not a problem, Doctor. I am responsible. I do not get… drunk. Just… one or two. Is that enough? Can we finish now? I really must go.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, thank you. Alright, Kiwane, I think I have a good overall picture of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. It won't take long. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and have a quick look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Is this necessary? I told you, I am healthy. But… if you must. Be quick, please. I do not have much time. And… be gentle. I am a strong man, but I do not need… rough handling. What exactly will you be doing?
DOCTOR: Of course. As I said, it’s just a routine check. I'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate – I just need to put this cuff around your arm. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope – it doesn't hurt at all, I just need you to breathe normally. I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat with a light, and feel your abdomen. It should only take a few minutes, and I'll be as gentle as possible. Shall we start with your blood pressure then?
PATIENT: Fine. But do not take too long. And be careful with that… cuff. It looks… tight. Just get it over with quickly. I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. Deep breaths are good. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not a major concern right now. We can monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally – I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Good. Now, let’s just quickly check your ears and throat. Please open your mouth and say “Ahhh”. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears look normal as well. Everything seems to be in good working order so far. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: No pain. It is… just a little uncomfortable. I have a strong stomach. I eat many things, remember? It is sometimes… gassy, but that is normal. I do not understand why you are doing all of this. I feel fine. Are you finished yet? I really must go. This is… a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything feels normal to me as well. Just a little bit of tenderness, but nothing concerning. Okay, Kiwane, I think I’ve got everything I need for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, you appear to be in generally good health. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting your alcohol intake. It's also a good idea to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible – I can provide you with some resources if you’re interested. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Slightly elevated? That is all? I told you I was fine. And I do eat healthy. I do not need you to tell me that. Resources? No, thank you. I do not need resources. Will this… check-up affect my insurance? Will they still cover me? That is the important question. I do not want any… problems with the coverage. Is everything alright with that? That is all I care about.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Kiwane. And the answer is no, this check-up will not affect your insurance coverage. It’s a standard baseline assessment, and it’s actually required for Medicare to approve your coverage. The slight elevation in your blood pressure is just something we’ll monitor – it doesn’t disqualify you from coverage in any way. I’ll document everything in your chart, and Medicare will be notified automatically. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. You said it is automatic? Medicare will be notified? I do not need to do anything? Very well. Then I suppose… thank you. It was… satisfactory. I will leave now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiwane. And yes, everything is automatic. You don’t need to do anything further. It was nice meeting you. If you have any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day.
