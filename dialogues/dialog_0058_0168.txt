DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Todoroovich, it’s… a situation. A delicate situation, really. I’m dating someone new, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is… as it should be. You know, before things get too serious. It’s simply responsible, don’t you think? I wouldn't want any… surprises.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes, I suppose. Though usually, these concerns are addressed before things get serious, not after. But, alright. So you’re wanting STI screening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not just that. Though, yes, that’s part of it, naturally. It’s more… comprehensive. I want to know if he’s… compatible. You understand. I’ve always been very particular about my… standards. And frankly, some people just don’t maintain themselves. It reflects on me, you see. I want a full checkup, everything. And perhaps a little advice. It's important to ensure this relationship is… suitable.
DOCTOR: “Compatible,” and you mean a complete physical exam, including STI screening, and… what else exactly are you hoping I’ll assess for compatibility, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose a complete blood panel would be a good start. You know, to assess his overall health. And I wouldn’t object to some… genetic testing. Just to be certain there aren’t any… unfortunate predispositions. And, truthfully, I’d appreciate a psychological evaluation. Not for me, of course. I’m perfectly stable. But one never knows what skeletons someone might be hiding. It's simply prudent, Doctor. Don’t you agree? I want to be absolutely certain he’s… a good match for me. It's about my future happiness, you understand.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, what you are requesting is… extensive, and frankly, largely unnecessary. “Compatibility” is not a medical term. Genetic testing based on relationship suitability isn’t a standard practice. And a psychological evaluation of your dating partner without a clinical indication?
PATIENT: Oh, I assure you, Doctor, it’s perfectly reasonable. I simply want the best for myself. And I'm paying for this, aren't I? I expect a certain level of thoroughness. I've always taken a proactive approach to my health – and my life. You’re the medical professional here; I expect you to be able to accommodate my needs. Surely you’ve encountered someone with discerning standards before? It's not about him, necessarily. It's about ensuring my peace of mind. I wouldn't want to invest my time and energy in someone who isn't… up to par. You understand, don’t you? It’s a matter of self-respect.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand you’re concerned about your future relationship, and you’re willing to pay for testing. However, I am ethically obligated to provide medically necessary care. Extensive genetic screening and a psychological evaluation based solely on relationship “compatibility” are not medically indicated, and I will not perform them. I can offer a standard STI screening, a complete blood panel to assess overall health – as you requested – and a physical exam. Those are reasonable and appropriate. But I will not participate in what amounts to a… lifestyle assessment. Do you wish to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Well, that is… disappointing. Truly disappointing. I suppose I had higher expectations for a medical professional. But, very well. If I must. A standard STI screening, the blood panel, and… a cursory physical exam. But I expect a detailed report, Doctor. Every single result. And I will be expecting you to be… thorough. Don't skimp on anything simply because it doesn't fit your… narrow definition of “necessary.” And I trust you’ll be discreet. This is a private matter, after all. I wouldn’t want word getting around.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Pandolfi. I assure you, all results will be provided in a detailed report, and confidentiality is, of course, maintained. Let's start with a brief medical history, then we’ll proceed to the physical exam. Have you had any previous sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No, never. Absolutely not. I’ve always been… careful. Very careful. It's simply not something I’d tolerate. I've always prioritized my health and wellbeing. And I expect the same of anyone I… associate with. It’s a matter of principle, you see. A rather important principle, at that. I maintain a very… clean lifestyle, Doctor. You can be assured of that.
DOCTOR: Good. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. Though I do prefer natural remedies whenever possible. I find they're far less… invasive. But for something like this, I suppose I'll trust your professional judgment. As long as it’s something… mild. I certainly don’t want anything with unpleasant side effects. My skin is rather sensitive, you see. And I have a rather important social calendar to maintain. Downtime is simply not an option.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And occasionally, I'll take some herbal tea for… stress. Though, truthfully, my current situation is causing rather more stress than any tea can alleviate. It’s simply… unsettling, you see. Having to subject myself to all of this testing. But I suppose it's a necessary evil, if I'm to ensure my future happiness. It's all rather… tedious, really. But I’m a patient person, Doctor. I can endure. As long as it’s worth it in the end.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath...and exhale.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, this gown is rather unflattering. And the temperature in here is rather chilly. One would think a medical facility would prioritize patient comfort. But proceed, I suppose. Just… be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes… Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Lymph nodes, you say? Is something amiss? I do hope it's nothing serious. I’ve always been very diligent about my health, as I’ve mentioned. I eat a very healthy diet, I exercise regularly, and I avoid all known toxins. It's simply unthinkable that anything would be… wrong. Though, perhaps this testing will provide some peace of mind. It’s all rather… unsettling, you see. The thought of something being… out of order.
DOCTOR: No tenderness or enlargement. Everything feels normal. Now I'll just take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Open your mouth and say "Ahhh"...
PATIENT: Aaaahhh. Is everything alright? My throat feels a little dry, actually. Perhaps all this… anxiety. And this examination room is rather sterile. A little greenery would do wonders for the ambiance, don't you think? It’s all so… clinical. A little more warmth would be most appreciated. Are you finished? This is rather… exposing, you see.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal. No signs of infection. I’ll quickly listen to your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back.
PATIENT: Abdomen, you say? Very well. Though I must admit, I had a rather large lunch today. Perhaps that will affect your… findings. I do enjoy a good meal, you see. It’s one of life’s simple pleasures. And I am rather particular about my digestion. It’s simply essential for maintaining a healthy… constitution. Are you finished yet, Doctor? This is rather… undignified, you know. Lying here like this.
DOCTOR: Bowel sounds are normal. Everything appears normal physically, Ms. Pandolfi. However, we still need to await the results of the blood work and STI screening for a complete assessment. We'll also need to discuss your weight. Your BMI is 33.8, which falls into the obese category. This can contribute to various health issues. We should discuss some potential lifestyle modifications.
PATIENT: Obese? Goodness gracious! I assure you, Doctor, I am not obese. I am… robust. And I maintain a perfectly healthy diet. I simply enjoy my food. And I have a very… active social life, which requires a certain level of… indulgence. I hardly think a few extra pounds are cause for alarm. And I certainly don't need a lecture on lifestyle modifications. I am perfectly capable of managing my own health, thank you very much. This is rather… insulting, actually. I came here for a pre-relationship assessment, not a weight-loss consultation. I find this entirely inappropriate. Are you suggesting I’m somehow… undesirable?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I apologize if I offended you. My intention was not to make you feel undesirable. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to address health concerns, and your weight does fall into a category that increases your risk for several medical conditions. I’m not suggesting you need to drastically alter your lifestyle, but simply being aware of the risks and potentially making small, manageable changes could improve your overall health. We can discuss it further if you're willing, or we can simply focus on the test results. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose a brief discussion wouldn't hurt. But I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. I have a very… vigorous constitution. But I am willing to listen, briefly. However, I expect you to be discreet. I do not wish to discuss my weight with anyone. It’s a private matter, you understand. And I certainly don't need a lecture on portion control or… exercise regimes. I simply want to be informed, not… scolded. And if it’s going to involve any… drastic changes, then I’m not interested. Now, proceed. But keep it concise, Doctor. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. As you know, a BMI over 30 increases your risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and joint problems. Small changes, such as increasing your daily activity – even a brisk walk for 30 minutes – and making mindful food choices can significantly reduce those risks. We can discuss healthy eating options and resources for physical activity if you’re interested. We don’t need to overhaul your entire lifestyle, just focus on manageable adjustments. And I assure you, everything will remain confidential. Let’s wait for the lab results before we decide on any specific course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. A brisk walk… Perhaps. I do enjoy a stroll in the park. And I suppose I could be… more mindful of my food choices. But I refuse to deprive myself of the pleasures of life. I simply won’t tolerate it. And I certainly won’t be participating in any… rigorous exercise regimes. I have a very busy social calendar, you see. And I expect you to respect my boundaries, Doctor. Now, let’s move on. What about these test results? When can I expect them? And what exactly are we testing for? I want a detailed explanation, Doctor. No medical jargon, please. I expect you to explain everything in layman's terms. I'm a discerning woman, but I am not a medical professional. Now, proceed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. The blood work will be a comprehensive metabolic panel, which checks your organ function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. It will also include a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. The STI screening will test for common sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. We'll also test for hepatitis B and C. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to return results. Once we have them, we can discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Herpes? Goodness gracious! I certainly don’t have herpes! That is… unthinkable. I assure you, Doctor, I have always been… careful. Very careful. I would never put myself at risk for such a… dreadful affliction. And to even suggest it…! But yes, I suppose I have a question. What if… what if something is amiss? What if I test positive for one of these… infections? What would happen then? And would it be… visible? I do hope not. I have a very important social engagement next week. Now, please, enlighten me. And keep it concise, Doctor. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, the STI screening is a routine precaution. A positive result doesn't necessarily mean you're currently symptomatic or experiencing an active outbreak. Many STIs are asymptomatic, meaning you wouldn't even know you have them. If you do test positive for an STI, we'll discuss treatment options. Most STIs are easily treatable with antibiotics or antiviral medications. And we’ll ensure your partner is also tested and treated. We also offer counseling and resources to prevent future transmission. As for visibility, symptoms vary depending on the infection. Some cause visible sores or rashes, while others have no visible symptoms at all. Let's wait for the results before we speculate. It's important to remain calm and focus on getting the information we need. We can discuss treatment options and counseling if a positive result occurs. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Counseling? Goodness gracious. I hardly think I need counseling. I am a perfectly stable and well-adjusted woman. But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to have someone to talk to, if something… unfortunate occurs. Very well. I think that is all for now, Doctor. I shall await your call with… trepidation. And I expect you to be discreet. This is a private matter, you understand. And I trust you will treat me with the respect I deserve. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. Your privacy is of utmost importance, and I assure you I will handle everything with the utmost discretion. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Have a pleasant luncheon. .
