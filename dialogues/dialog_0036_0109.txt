DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… yeah. Back of the head.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache, primarily at the back of your head, for about three days. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe? It’s… a dull ache. Not sharp. Like… someone is squeezing. Not hard squeezing, just… there. And sometimes, when I move my head… it feels a little worse. Like a… a pull. Does that make sense? I worked with the trains my whole life, you know. Lots of moving. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull, squeezing ache at the back of your head that worsens with movement. And you mentioned a history of working with trains – a lot of head movement. That's good information. To get a better understanding, can you tell me if anything specifically triggers the pain, besides moving your head?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers… Let me think. Not really, not that I notice. It’s just… there. Sometimes when I bend over to tie my shoes, maybe a little bit worse. But mostly, it's just… always there, a little bit. I drink my coffee in the morning, like always. I eat my breakfast. Nothing special. I don’t do much these days, you know. Since my wife… passed. Just quiet. Very quiet. It hurts more when I try to sleep sometimes, I think. I gotta move a lot to get comfy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s fairly constant, a little worse with bending and definitely impacts your sleep, requiring you to shift positions to get comfortable. You also mentioned it's been more noticeable since your wife passed, and you've been keeping very quiet. I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Brum. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you rate this headache at its most intense?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Most intense… It's not a bad pain, you know? Not like when I broke my arm when I was a young man. That was a ten, for sure! This… maybe a four? Sometimes five, if I’ve been trying to sleep and can't get comfy. Usually it’s more like a three, or even a two. It’s just… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a three to five, typically a three, with occasional spikes to a five, and mostly just annoying. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not really. No blurry vision. No dizziness. No… feeling sick to my stomach. No fever. I haven’t been feeling hot, you know? Just… the headache. And… sometimes I feel a little tired. But I'm ninety years old! I think being tired is normal, right?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, feeling tired at ninety years old is perfectly normal. And no fever, no nausea, no dizziness, and no vision changes – that’s good to know. Mr. Brum, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Doctor gave me some pills for my water when I was younger, for something… I don’t remember what. Didn’t make me sick, though. My wife… she was allergic to some flower, I think. Made her sneeze a lot. But me? No. No allergies. I eat everything. Well, almost everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're currently taking no medications, as far as you know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at your head and neck. We'll also do some simple neurological tests to see how everything is functioning. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be. But yeah, go ahead. I'll just sit here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Brum, I’m just checking your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Everything seems normal so far, but the tenderness at the base of your skull is notable. Given your history and the exam findings, it’s possible this is tension headache related to muscle strain, perhaps exacerbated by your age and decreased range of motion. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple X-ray of your cervical spine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… hmm. Is that… safe? I don’t want too much of that… radiation, you know? But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust you. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then okay. But just… not too much, alright? I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask about the radiation, Mr. Brum. We always want to minimize exposure. The amount of radiation from a single cervical spine X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out other potential causes of your headache outweigh the risks in this case. We’ll use the lowest dose possible and take all necessary precautions. Okay, I’ve ordered the X-ray. The radiology department will call you when it’s ready, likely this afternoon. While we wait for the results, I recommend taking over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the pain, following the dosage instructions on the label. Also, gentle neck stretches and warm compresses may provide some relief. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… that’s like… Tylenol, right? My wife used to take that. Okay, I can do that. And warm compresses… yeah, that sounds nice. I have a heating pad at home. Gentle stretches… I’ll try, but I’m not very flexible anymore. Just… don’t want to pull something. So… just take the pills and use the heating pad. And wait for the phone call. Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, acetaminophen is Tylenol. And ibuprofen is Advil or Motrin. Just be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle. And yes, gentle stretches and warm compresses. No need to push yourself – listen to your body. Exactly. Take the pills as needed, use the heating pad, and we’ll wait for the X-ray results. The radiology department will call when they’re available. I’ll review them carefully and call you to discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions or concerns today, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking your time with me. Being an old man… sometimes it's hard to remember everything. And I worry too much, I think. But thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. And please, don't worry about remembering everything - that's what I'm here for. We'll take things one step at a time. Here’s a pamphlet with some more information about tension headaches. Feel free to call the office if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and please, take care.
