DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Just... the nurse lady said to come. Something about… learning things? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. It can be a little overwhelming sometimes. So, your husband scheduled this appointment for you. Do you mind if we try to piece things together?
PATIENT: Piece things… together? Like a puzzle? I don’t… I work with metal, you know? Cutting and bending. Not puzzles. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: No puzzles, no. Just figuring out what’s going on with your health. It shouldn't take long, Airam, but the more information we have, the better I can help. It sounds like you work with metal – is there anything related to your work that might be bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well… my back aches. It always aches. Been aching for years. It’s just… work. Heavy things. Lifting. Bending. My husband keeps saying I should be more careful, but… what else am I going to do? It pays the bills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a physically demanding job. And it’s good you’re working, and providing. This back pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been lifting a lot. Or… bending a lot. Like I said. Some days it’s just a dull ache, other days… it’s hard to even stand up straight. But I take some… pills. The red ones. My husband gives them to me. I don’t know what they’re for.
DOCTOR: Okay, the red pills. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of those. And you’re right to mention that it varies – dull ache some days, harder to stand up straight others. Does anything specifically make it worse – besides lifting and bending?
PATIENT: Hmm… Cold weather, maybe? When it’s really cold, it gets stiffer. And… sitting for too long. That’s bad. Makes it ache worse. I try to keep moving, even when I’m resting. My husband says I can’t sit still. He’s always nagging.
DOCTOR: It sounds like cold weather and prolonged sitting aggravate it. It’s good you’re trying to keep moving, that’s very helpful. Now, besides your back, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. My knees sometimes… crack. Loudly. But it doesn’t hurt. It just… cracks. Like little firecrackers. My husband says I’m getting old. He jokes, I think. But he also tells me to take more breaks. He worries too much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Knee cracking isn't usually a cause for concern, especially if it's not painful. It sounds like your husband is just looking out for you. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? I don't… I don’t think so. The doctor lady, a long time ago, she said my blood pressure was a little high, maybe? But I don't remember. And… I had the flu once. Really bad. But that was years ago. That’s all I can think of. I don’t go to the doctor often.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And it's alright if you don't remember all the details. We can work with what you do recall. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had surgery. I don't like hospitals. Or doctors. Too many… needles. And… poking. My husband had his appendix out, once. He complained for weeks. But me? Never. No surgery.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she… she had problems with her stomach, I think. Always complaining. And my father… he worked with metal, too. Like me. He had bad hands. Arthritis, maybe? Lots of pain. But he didn’t go to the doctor either. Stubborn man.
DOCTOR: Alright, stomach problems in your mother, and possible arthritis in your father. That's helpful. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I like spicy food. My husband doesn’t like it so spicy, but I like it. He says it’s bad for my stomach. But I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. Not that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – besides the red pills your husband gives you?
PATIENT: Hmm… No. Just the red pills. Sometimes I take something for a headache. But it’s just over-the-counter. You know, from the store. Ibuprofen, I think. When it's a really bad headache. But not every day. Maybe once a month?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? You mean… like poking and prodding? My husband always tells me to get check-ups. But I don't like being poked and prodded. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Airam. It won’t be anything too invasive, I promise. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and feeling around to see where you might be experiencing discomfort. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. It's mostly to get a better sense of your overall condition and pinpoint the source of your back pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But… be gentle. And don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. And if it hurts, I’m stopping you.
DOCTOR: Of course. Gentle, quick, and we’ll stop immediately if anything is uncomfortable. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, which is what you mentioned previously, but not drastically so. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. But… hurry. I don’t like being on my back. It makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax as much as you can. I'm going to gently feel your spine, starting at the base of your neck. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there. That hurts. It always hurts when I’ve been lifting things. You’re pressing on it too hard. Be careful!
DOCTOR: I apologize. Just a little sensitivity there. Okay. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! No. I can’t. It hurts too much. See? I told you it hurts. I’m not flexible. Never have been. My husband always says I need to stretch, but…
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough for now. No need to push yourself. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Crack! See? That’s what I was talking about. It doesn't hurt, just… cracks. My husband thinks it’s funny. But it feels… weird.
DOCTOR: It’s just a bit of crepitus, which is common. No swelling or redness, that’s good. Now, can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Ugh… That feels… stiff. Like an old door. I need to get a cup of tea. This is making me nervous. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, you’ve done wonderfully. That’s enough for the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing lower back pain, likely related to your physically demanding job. The cracking in your knees doesn't seem to be cause for immediate concern. I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back just to rule out any underlying issues, like arthritis or a compressed vertebra. And I think it would be helpful to start you on a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core and improve your posture. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: X-rays? You mean… like the ones that show your bones? I don’t like radiation. Is it safe? And physical therapy… that means exercise, right? I don't do exercise. My husband will be so happy.
DOCTOR: You’re right, they show your bones. The amount of radiation is very minimal, much less than you’d get from a cross-country flight. It's a quick and painless procedure, and it will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. As for physical therapy, it’s not about strenuous exercise. It involves gentle stretches and strengthening exercises, tailored to your specific needs, to help alleviate your pain and prevent future injuries. It can be very helpful. It’s not about pushing yourself, but about learning how to move your body more effectively. We can discuss if it's something you would consider. I do want to address the pain and get you feeling better. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: I don't know... It sounds like a lot of work. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. Can't I just take some more pills? The red ones seem to help… sometimes. And I don't want to go to another doctor. My husband already schedules too many appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It’s perfectly valid to feel overwhelmed. However, relying solely on medication can have long-term side effects, and it doesn’t address the underlying cause of the pain. It sounds like the red pills provide some temporary relief, but it's important to know what they are, and whether they’re the best long-term solution for you. I think the best course of action is to first identify what these pills are. Do you happen to have the bottle with you, or do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No. My husband keeps them. He's always in charge of the pills. He says I’ll forget. I think… they’re small and white? Round, maybe? I don’t really pay attention. He just tells me to take them. Honestly, I just want this over with. Can we just… skip the X-rays?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam. But without knowing what the pills are, and without getting a clear picture of your lower back with the X-rays, it’s difficult for me to provide you with the best possible care. I want to make sure we're addressing the root of the problem, and not just masking the symptoms. Given that you’re unable to identify the pills at this time, and you’re hesitant about the X-rays, I would recommend a consultation with a specialist – a rheumatologist. They can assess your pain, determine the cause, and recommend a comprehensive treatment plan. They can also determine the pills you are currently taking. Would you be open to a referral to a rheumatologist?
PATIENT: Another doctor? Ugh. My husband will be thrilled. But… I guess… if you think it’s necessary. But… will it take long? And will it be expensive? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and expense. I’ll provide you with a referral to a rheumatologist who accepts your insurance, and I’ll make sure to include information about their fees and appointment availability. The appointment itself may take an hour or two, depending on the doctor and the extent of your evaluation. I will also provide you with resources for financial assistance, if needed. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant to help alleviate your lower back pain. It's not a long-term solution, but it may provide some temporary relief while you're waiting for your appointment with the rheumatologist. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… sounds okay, I guess. As long as it doesn’t make me too sleepy. I need to be able to work. And… make sure they know I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. And if it costs too much, I’m cancelling.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I’ll make sure to note your concerns about the poking and prodding, and I’ll write the prescription for a muscle relaxant with the lowest possible dose to minimize any side effects. I'll also provide you with a list of rheumatologists in the area who accept your insurance and offer financial assistance options. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant, and this is the referral for the rheumatologist. Please schedule the appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s everything. Just… thank you. I guess. My husband will be happy you’re taking care of this. Hopefully, it won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Airam. I hope you find relief soon. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to take it easy. .
