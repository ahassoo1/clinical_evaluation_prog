DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's not really bringing me in, you know? More like... I just thought I'd see what all the fuss is about with this new place. My friend, Eun-hee, she raved about Dr. Osga, said she was a very thorough woman. I don’t really need anything, not that I can recall. Just…checking things out. You know, preventative. Though, frankly, I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Preventative, right. Well, that’s… good. Though coming in when you feel “perfectly fine” isn’t exactly efficient, is it?
PATIENT: Efficient? Oh, please. I have plenty of time. My husband… well, he always said I worried too much about things like efficiency. He handled all that. And now… It doesn’t matter. I’m retired, aren't I? What am I going to do, rush around and… build something? No. Don't you worry your head about efficient. I’m paying with Medicare, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes, I see that. Look, Mrs. Calvery, with all due respect, a check-up is a good thing, even if you feel fine. It's just… helpful to have a reason for it. Any aches, pains, changes in appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, heavens. Everything changes, doesn't it? I'm sixty-four! My appetite… well, I eat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends. Sleep… sometimes I sleep. Sometimes I don't. I used to sleep like a log, before… You know, before everything. Honestly, I can't remember exactly when things started changing. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be truthful. Are you going to ask me about my childhood next? Because I assure you, that was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. A blur. Okay. Let’s try this. Any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, dear. I wouldn’t know. I… I don’t really weigh myself. It’s a bit… depressing, isn’t it? I mean, what good does knowing a number do? I either fit into my clothes or I don’t. Though I suppose they might be a little… looser than they used to be. But that’s probably just the wash. Everything shrinks these days.
DOCTOR: Looser… alright. And how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy? Well, I don’t run marathons, if that’s what you're asking. I get up, I putter around the house, I watch a little television… it's enough. I don't go out much anymore. Used to, before… you know. It's just... easier this way. Honestly, I wouldn't say I’ve been tired, just… less inclined. Does that make sense? I just don’t have the… drive anymore.
DOCTOR: Less inclined… alright. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm… Well, I get a little winded sometimes, climbing the stairs. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I'm not a young woman anymore. And the stairs are rather steep. It's nothing serious, I assure you. Probably just… out of shape. Though, frankly, I’ve never been one for exercise. It's terribly undignified, all that huffing and puffing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… basic things. Sit there, please. And try to relax. Honestly, you’re making this… difficult.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam? Really? I thought we were just… chatting. I suppose if you insist. But do be gentle, dear. My skin is rather sensitive these days. And don't poke too much! Honestly, I don't see what good all this prodding is going to do. But, alright, go ahead. Just... hurry, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds… regular, but a slight murmur. Probably benign. Lungs… clear, but some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Okay, breathe deeply. Hmm. A little wheezing now. Are you a smoker, Mrs. Calvery?
PATIENT: Smoker? Heavens, no! My husband, bless his soul, he used to smoke. Dreadful habit. Filled the house with that awful smell. I always made him go outside. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Though… …I did spend a lot of time near him when he was smoking, back then. Maybe… maybe that’s it? I don’t know. It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Exposure… alright. Okay, Mrs. Calvery, I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Just relax. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, dear. That’s a little… tender. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. It’s probably just gas, isn't it? I had a rather large dinner last night. My friend Eun-hee made a lovely kimchi jjigae, but it does… sometimes disagree with me. Yes, definitely gas. Don’t press so hard, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, a quick neurological check. Just follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t strain. Just follow it.
PATIENT: There… there it is. Oh, goodness. Is it moving? It’s a bit blurry, you know. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. Is that a red dot? Are you sure it's not red? I always thought red was a particularly… distracting color. Honestly, I'm not sure I can see it very well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mrs. Calvery, based on what you've told me, and the brief exam… you’re presenting with some vague symptoms. Reduced energy, some shortness of breath, wheezing, abdominal tenderness and… some difficulty with neurological assessment. It's difficult to determine a precise cause without further investigation. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. I also recommend you schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist to assess your vision. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was… a very long time ago. And I’m almost certain that wasn’t an allergy, it was just the pollen. Honestly, I’m not one for remembering those sorts of things. Though… I did have a rather bad reaction to a seafood dish once, at Eun-hee's. But that might have just been a bad oyster. Yes, I'm quite sure it was the oyster. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Seafood… possible allergy. Okay. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, dear. Let me see. Well, there's the little blue pill for my blood pressure, of course. My husband… well, he insisted I take it. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take a little something for that. But only when it gets really bad. What was it called? I think… I think it had a "cox" in the name. Or was it a "cam"? Honestly, I have so many little bottles. I just ask Eun-hee to refill them for me when I run low.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. I've documented everything. We'll get the blood work and X-ray scheduled. And I strongly recommend you make an appointment with both an ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist, and bring a list of all your medications. Honestly, this is… difficult. I'll write you a referral. I also suggest limiting strenuous activity until we have results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that sounds terribly complicated. I suppose not. No, I don't think so. Just… when will I get the results? I have a mahjong game next Tuesday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. Though honestly, I’m not sure I’m up to all that thinking these days. Is it okay if Eun-hee comes with me to pick them up? She’s very good with…details.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you. And yes, Eun-hee can accompany you. Just… please, Mrs. Calvery, try to be more specific next time. Alright, next patient. You're free to go. .
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Alright then. Thank you, dear. Eun-hee and her details… Mahjong… I really should remember to bring my lucky tile… .
