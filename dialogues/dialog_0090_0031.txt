DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, you see. And I know I have a bit of an irregular heartbeat, the atrial fibrillation. It’s mostly the leg that’s bothering me right now, though.
DOCTOR: Swollen leg, alright. And you already know about the atrial fibrillation… that’s good you're aware. Now, when did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three days ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness. But it's gotten worse each day. It’s quite noticeable now, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Three days ago, progressively worsening. And where exactly is the swelling located?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And a bit around my ankle too. It doesn't go all the way up my leg, just the lower part. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. Walking is a bit difficult.
DOCTOR: Calf and ankle, making walking difficult. Any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, there is some pain. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you see. And it feels… heavy. Like it’s weighing me down. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a bit.
DOCTOR: Heavy and aching, worse with standing. Alright. And have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… I haven’t really checked for warmth, to be honest. It looks… a normal color, I suppose. Maybe a little paler than my other leg, but I don't know if that's important. I haven’t seen any redness, no. I'm not sure what to look for exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look then. If you wouldn’t mind, please sit on the examination table. I'll need to examine your leg. We need to rule out some possibilities, you understand.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m a bit nervous, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… I’m just going to feel around. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. Hmm… yes, there is definite pitting edema here. And the skin is slightly warm to the touch. Pulse is present, though a little weak. Now, let's check your ankle reflexes.
PATIENT: Pitting edema? I’m not sure what that means, but it doesn't sound good. That’s a little sore, yes. And weak pulse… is that bad? I… I don't know much about any of this, I'm afraid. The ankle reflexes… just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your leg. Response is… diminished. Hmm. It appears there is some decreased blood flow in that leg, and the swelling isn't normal. We need to get a D-dimer test to rule out a blood clot. And I'd also like to check your kidney function and liver enzymes, just to be safe. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds very serious! No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine before. I haven't taken much, to be honest, but I've never had any problems. Is it… is it bad? Should I be really worried about this blood clot?
DOCTOR: Now, now, don’t panic. We are ruling it out. It doesn’t mean you have one. But with the swelling, diminished pulse, and your history of atrial fibrillation… it's best to be thorough. Alright. I'm ordering the D-dimer, kidney function panel, and liver enzymes. We'll get the results back quickly. In the meantime, I'm going to have you elevate your leg and I'll have the nurse bring you some compression stockings. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Elevate my leg… and compression stockings. That sounds… sensible. I don't take any regular medications, Doctor. Not even over-the-counter ones. I try to stay healthy, you see. Mostly just drink a lot of water. And maybe a vitamin tablet occasionally, but nothing special. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Sensible indeed. We will see what the tests show. Alright, no medications. The nurse will be in shortly with the compression stockings and to draw your blood. We'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Try not to put any weight on that leg until we know more. Do you have any family history of blood clots or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My grandfather, on my mother’s side… he had a very weak heart. He passed away when I was quite young, but I remember my mother saying he had trouble walking and was always very tired. And… my uncle, her brother, he had deep vein thrombosis once, after he broke his leg skiing. That was quite a few years ago, though. I don't know much about it, to be honest. Is that… bad? Does that mean I'm more likely to have one?
DOCTOR: A history of atrial fibrillation and a family history of blood clots… yes, that increases your risk. It's still not a definitive diagnosis, but it certainly makes it more concerning. That’s why we are being thorough. We need to rule out pulmonary embolism as well, given your symptoms and family history. The nurse will explain everything, but she'll also be scheduling a CT scan of your chest to rule out a clot in your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? A clot in my lungs?! Oh dear… No, I don't… I don’t think I understand. What’s a pulmonary embolism? And… is it very serious? I’m getting quite scared, Doctor. I thought I just had a swollen leg. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Now, now. Deep breaths. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow. It can be very serious, which is why we are being cautious and getting the CT scan. It's a standard procedure, and it’s the best way to determine what’s going on. The nurse will explain the procedure in detail. You have atrial fibrillation, which means your heart isn't beating regularly. That increases the risk of clots forming. Your family history… it adds to the concern. We need to be certain. And frankly, given your lack of preventative care, it’s best we are aggressive now. Do you have any questions for me at this time, or shall I have the nurse come in and explain the procedure?
PATIENT: Preventative care…? Oh. I… I haven't really been to the doctor much. I just haven’t bothered, to be honest. It's… a bit embarrassing. I just hoped it was something simple. I don't… I don’t think I have any questions right now. I'm just… scared. Can I… can I call someone? Just… to let them know? I don’t want to be alone. And… what if it is serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. It's a good thing you came in when you did. The nurse will bring you a phone and allow you to make a call. She can also explain the CT scan procedure. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. We'll discuss a plan of action then. Now, try to remain calm. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. And, frankly, it would have been better if you’d scheduled regular check-ups. The nurse will be with you shortly.
