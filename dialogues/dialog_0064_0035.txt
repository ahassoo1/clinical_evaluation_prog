DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Smetak. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It's been going on for… well, a good few days now, I reckon. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times. A bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, yes. A few days, you say?
PATIENT: That’s right. Started, oh, I’d say Tuesday, maybe? Wednesday at the latest. They come and go, like little surprises. Not painful, just… irritating. And a bit disruptive when you’re trying to have a nice cuppa, you know?
DOCTOR: I can imagine that would be quite disruptive with your tea. Now, when they started on Tuesday or Wednesday, can you recall anything specific you were doing or eating around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Tuesday… I had lunch with my niece, Lani. We went to that new cafe down by the market. Had a lovely tuna sandwich and a glass of lemonade. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. Oh! And a little slice of passionfruit cheesecake for dessert. Perhaps that cheesecake? It was rather rich. Though I've had rich things before and never had this trouble.
DOCTOR: Passionfruit cheesecake is an interesting thought. It’s good we’re trying to pinpoint things. Now, aside from the hiccups, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little bit… bloated, I suppose. Not terribly uncomfortable, just… full. Even when I haven't eaten much. And maybe a little bit of heartburn, here and there. But I get heartburn from time to time anyway, so I didn’t really pay it much mind. Old age, eh? Things just start to… go a bit wonky.
DOCTOR: Bloating and occasional heartburn... alright. And have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully not. No vomiting at all. And just a little bit of queasiness, maybe, once or twice. But it passes quickly. It’s not like I've been feeling sick, just… unsettled. It's more the hiccups that are the bother. They really throw me off!
DOCTOR: Right. No vomiting, just occasional queasiness and the hiccups being the main problem. Now, Ms. Sucich, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure – losartan, I think it’s called. Small white one, once a day. And that’s about it. Allergies… not that I know of. I used to be a bit sensitive to pollen when I was younger, but that’s gone away with age. No food allergies, no reactions to anything I can recall. I'm a pretty simple woman, Doctor. Not much troubles me, usually.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll have a quick feel of your abdomen, just to get a better understanding of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I used to be a psychiatric aide, you know. Spent years taking people's vitals. It’s all very familiar, though I’m much more comfortable giving the check-up than receiving one!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and certainly explains your composure. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. A little cool, maybe, but no pain at all. Just… a bit soft, if that makes sense? Like it’s full of air. Oh! There's a little twinge just there, on the left side. But it’s barely noticeable. It comes and goes, really. And it's not a sharp pain, just… a reminder that something's there.
DOCTOR: Alright, mild tenderness on the left side, with a sensation of fullness. Now, Ms. Sucich, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing some trapped gas, possibly related to something you ate. The bloating, occasional heartburn, and hiccups can all be symptoms of that. The mild tenderness could be from the pressure of the gas. However, since the hiccups have persisted for a few days, and you're 86, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. We can start with some simple measures, but I'd also like to order a blood test to check your electrolyte levels and kidney function. Just to be safe. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. Trapped gas… well, that wouldn't surprise me at all! I do enjoy my food, you know. And a blood test… no trouble at all. I’ve had plenty of those in my time. As long as it gives you peace of mind, I'm happy to do it. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially at my age. What do I need to do about the test?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab just down the street – they're open until 5pm today. You don’t need to fast for this particular test. The results should be back within 24-48 hours, and my nurse will call you to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated drinks, chewing gum, and foods that are known to cause gas, like beans and broccoli. Over-the-counter simethicone can also help to relieve the gas. If the hiccups continue, or if you develop any new symptoms – like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or vomiting – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Simethicone, no fizzy drinks, and watch for new symptoms. I can manage that just fine. Actually… one small thing. The nurse… will she be able to explain the results in plain English? Sometimes medical folks use words I don't quite understand. It’s not that I’m silly, you understand, just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sucich. My nurse, Lani – funnily enough, the same niece I mentioned earlier – is excellent at explaining things in plain English. She understands that medical jargon can be confusing, and she’ll take the time to make sure you understand everything. You can specifically ask for her when you call, and she’ll be happy to walk you through the results. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. Thank you for listening to an old woman’s hiccups! I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Sucich. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call. I'll have Lani send over that lab order now. Have a good day, and I hope those hiccups settle down soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And give Lani my regards! Bye now.
