DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just moved here. I think... I got somethin' in the mail 'bout comin' in? It was somethin' 'bout healthcare, I think. I don’t really remember much. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful to know, thank you. It sounds like you may have been contacted as part of our new patient welcome program. That's perfectly alright – sometimes those notices can be a bit confusing. So, even though you received a notice, are you currently experiencing any health concerns that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Um... not really? I mean, I feel okay. I work with machines all day, so sometimes my back gets a little sore. And my hands, too. But that's just from work, I think. I don't know... is there somethin' I should be talkin' about? I get mixed up sometimes, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to feel unsure when you’re just getting settled. And it's good you mentioned the back and hand soreness. Even if it's work-related, we should document it. Let's start with your back. How long has it been sore, and can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Um... a long time, I think? Maybe a few months? It's not bad bad, just kinda achy, ya know? Like after a really long day. It feels... all over, really. Not one specific spot. Just... tired. And sometimes it gets stiff, especially in the mornin'. I dunno if that makes sense. I just kinda stretch it out and it gets better.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Emileigh. "Achy all over" and stiff in the morning are good descriptions. And you've been stretching, which is good. Now, about your hands… is the pain similar to your back—achy—or is it different?
PATIENT: It’s… different. It's more like… tingly? And sometimes numb. Especially in my fingers. It kinda comes and goes. If I'm holdin' somethin' small for too long, it gets worse. Like, little screws or somethin'. It's kinda hard to explain. And I drop stuff sometimes. That’s new-ish.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling and numbness in the fingers, worse with fine motor tasks and dropping things. That’s helpful information. When did you first start noticing the tingling and numbness?
PATIENT: Uhh… I don’t really remember exactly. Maybe… a few weeks ago? It started real slow, just a little bit, then it got worse. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes it’s not there at all. It's kinda scary when I can’t feel somethin', but it doesn’t last long. I just… thought it was from work too much. I work with lots of little parts. And lots of vibrations, too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to clarify, you work with machines and small parts, involving fine motor skills and vibrations…do you wear any protective gear like gloves when you're working?
PATIENT: Uhhh… sometimes. I have gloves, but they get in the way. It's hard to feel what I'm doin’ when I have 'em on. So I usually don’t, unless it's somethin' really hot or somethin’. I know I should, probably. But I need to feel what I’m workin’ with, ya know? Everything’s so small. It’s hard to explain. I’m a mechanical… somethin'. Technician. I think.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It’s good you're aware of the potential risks, and I appreciate you being honest about that. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other health problems in the past?
PATIENT: Uhh… not really. I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. And maybe a broken arm when I was a kid? But that was… forever ago. I don't really go to the doctor much. I usually just try to tough it out. My… husband usually takes me if I need to go, but he's workin' a lot right now. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Emileigh. It’s good to know you haven’t had any significant medical issues. And it's perfectly fine that you don't usually see a doctor – many people are the same way. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones like ibuprofen or Tylenol?
PATIENT: Uhhh… sometimes. If my back really hurts, I take… ibuprofen, I think. The red one. But not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. And sometimes I take somethin' for sleep, if I can't sleep. But that's not very often either. Just... when I’m really stressed. It was… somethin’ blue? I don't remember the name. My husband gets it for me. He knows what I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain, and a blue sleep medication as needed. We’ll try to figure out exactly what that sleep medication is later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uhhh… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anythin’ that I remember. Maybe… a little itchy when I touch poison ivy? But that’s not an allergy, right? Just… a rash. I get those sometimes when I'm outside. My husband says I’m always getting into things. Sorry, am I rambling?
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Emileigh. It's good you haven't had any serious allergies. And poison ivy doesn't count as a medication allergy. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family’s health history?
PATIENT: Uhh… that’s hard. I don’t really know much about my family’s health. My… mom passed away when I was young. And my dad… he wasn’t around much. I don’t really know if anyone had any… bad stuff. I think my husband’s mom had… somethin' with her heart? But I don’t know much about it. Sorry, I’m not very good at rememberin' things like that. It’s just… always been me and my husband, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's completely understandable. Many people don't have detailed family health histories. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and range of motion. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Uhhh… yeah, okay. That sounds… fine. I guess. I don’t really like doctors much, but I’ll try. Is it gonna hurt? I get nervous easily. Sorry. And… what about my hands? Are you gonna check my hands too?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all, Emileigh. It will just be listening and feeling. And yes, I definitely want to check your hands. I'll start with your heart and lungs, and then we'll move on to your hands. I’m just going to listen to your breathing, okay?
PATIENT: Okay... I'm ready, I guess. Be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. Just relax. Your breathing sounds clear. Now, let's listen to your back. Your lungs are clear on this side as well. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you sit up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay... here I go. Is somethin' wrong? You're bein' quiet again.
DOCTOR: No, nothing’s wrong, Emileigh. Just checking your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, let's check your hands. Can you extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this? They look kinda shaky, don't they? And… they tingle a little now. It’s probably from work. Always from work.
DOCTOR: They are a little shaky, yes. And you mentioned tingling. Let me check your grip strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? It’s kinda hard to squeeze. It hurts a little, ya know? In my wrists. I always forget to wear my braces. My husband keeps tellin’ me. I’m not very strong, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh. It's okay if you don't squeeze very hard. Your grip is a little weak, yes, and I can see some swelling in your wrists. And you mentioned wearing braces...do you usually wear them?
PATIENT: Uhhh… not really. I have 'em, but they get in the way. It's hard to do my work with 'em on, ya know? Little screws and stuff. Everything’s so small. I need to feel what I’m doin'. My husband gets frustrated, but... I just need to get it done. And sometimes I forget to put ‘em on in the mornin'. I'm always forgettin' somethin', I think. I'm probably just making things worse, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're doing your best, Emileigh, and I appreciate your honesty. From what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The tingling and numbness in your hands, weakness in your grip, and swelling in your wrists, combined with your work with repetitive hand movements, are all suggestive of that. However, we need to do some testing to confirm that diagnosis. I'd like to order a nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of the nerves in your hands and wrists. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… nerve… what now? Is that gonna hurt? And is it serious? Carpal… tunnel? What's that? It sounds scary. I just thought my hands were… tired. Is it from work? Will I have to stop workin'? My husband would be really mad.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Emileigh, take a deep breath. A nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test that measures how well the nerves in your hands are working. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions, and it shouldn’t be painful, though it might be a little uncomfortable for a few moments. We'll place small electrodes on your skin, and then send a mild electrical current through the nerves. It's like a tiny little zap, and it helps us identify if there's any compression or damage to the nerves. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition caused by compression of the median nerve in the wrist. It can cause tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hand and fingers, like you've been experiencing. It can be serious if left untreated, but thankfully, there are effective treatments available. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop working, but we may need to make some adjustments to your work routine to reduce the stress on your wrists, such as using wrist braces, taking breaks more frequently, or modifying your hand positions. We’ll talk about all of that if the results confirm the diagnosis. Would you like me to explain more about the test, or would you prefer to schedule it first, and we can discuss the results afterwards?
PATIENT: Okay... okay. Explaining sounds good. Maybe… if I know what's gonna happen, it won't be so scary. What kinda adjustments? Like… what kinda changes? And… will I have to take time off? I really don’t wanna take time off. My husband… he’s been workin’ extra. And what if it is serious? What then?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take it one step at a time. The nerve conduction study is usually done in an outpatient setting, and it takes about 30-60 minutes. A technician will clean your skin and apply small electrodes, then send a series of mild electrical impulses through your nerves. It's like a tiny buzzing sensation, and they'll ask you to tell them if you feel anything. If the results confirm carpal tunnel syndrome, the adjustments to your work routine might include wearing wrist braces during work, taking frequent breaks to stretch your hands and wrists, adjusting your hand positions to avoid excessive bending or twisting, and ensuring your workstation is ergonomically designed. In most cases, these adjustments, along with physical therapy, can effectively manage the symptoms and prevent the condition from worsening. If the condition is more severe, we might consider other options, such as corticosteroid injections to reduce inflammation, or, in rare cases, surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve. But let’s not worry about surgery just yet. We’ll cross that bridge if we need to. The first step is to get the nerve conduction study done, and then we can discuss the results and create a personalized treatment plan that's right for you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. That sounds… better. A personalized plan… that’s good. Not surgery… that’s good too. So… the test first, then talk about the results. When can I do the test? And… where is it? And… will it cost a lot of money? I have Medicare, but… sometimes it doesn’t cover everything. My husband… he’s worried about the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm scheduling the nerve conduction study at Suburban Medical Imaging, it’s located just a few miles from here. The appointment is scheduled for August 9th at 10:00 AM. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers nerve conduction studies when it's deemed medically necessary. However, there might be a copay or deductible depending on your specific Medicare plan. I will have the billing department contact you to confirm your coverage and estimate any potential out-of-pocket costs. They can also help you understand your plan details and explore any financial assistance options if needed. I’ll also send a referral order to Suburban Medical Imaging and a summary of our conversation to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions about the appointment, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: August 9th… okay, I can remember that. And the billing people will call… that’s good. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all the questions I have for now. I’m still nervous, but… a little less nervous than before. Thank you again. Maybe… maybe everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help. And I understand your nervousness, but remember, we're taking things one step at a time. We'll get the test done, and then we'll create a plan to address any concerns. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your appointment. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed, including the referral order and contact information for the billing department. Take care, Emileigh. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
