DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in concise terms, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not a terrible pain, more like a…a tightness, really. Like someone’s got a band around my head.
DOCTOR: A tightness, you say. For how many days precisely, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. Started… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday. So, three days now. Maybe four. I keep good track of things, you know, but time does seem to slip away these days!
DOCTOR: Tuesday. Very well. And has anything specific happened around Tuesday that might correlate with the onset of this… tightness?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes! My wife, Delores, and I, we were helpin' our grandson, little Marcus, with a bit of gardenin'. He wanted to build a raised bed for his tomatoes, you see? Lots of bendin' and liftin', movin' bags of soil. Heavy bags, at that! I might’ve strained somethin' then, thinkin' about it. Didn’t feel it right away, though.
DOCTOR: Gardenin', lifting. And this 'tightness'… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly when I’m…well, movin’ around a lot. Or if I get a little flustered, you know? Like tryin’ to remember where I put my glasses – that’ll bring it on quick! But when I'm sittin' quiet, readin' or somethin', it's usually not too bad.
DOCTOR: And on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate this tightness at its most intense?
PATIENT: Hmm… at its worst? Oh, I wouldn’t say it’s a bad pain, not like a toothache. Maybe… a four? Five, on a bad day. Definitely livable, but…irritatin', you know? Just a constant pressure. Not sharp, just…there.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any other symptoms along with this 'tightness'?
PATIENT: Now that you ask... yes, actually. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when it’s botherin’ me the most. Just for a moment, mind you. And I’ve been feelin’ a bit… tired lately. But I’m an old man, Doctor! Tired is kinda my default state these days. Hard to say if that’s related, though.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision… fatigue. Very well. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, fever, or weakness?
PATIENT: No, no to all of that, Doctor. No sickness, no fever, and my arms and legs still work just fine, thank you very much! Still strong as an ox, even at my age. It's just this head, really. And the blurry vision when it flares up.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. Never been much for pills, if I can help it. A little chamomile tea now and then for sleepin’, but that’s it. Delores keeps tryin’ to get me to take somethin’ for my joints, but I refuse. I’ll stick to my gardening, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I need to check your vital signs and perform a neurological assessment. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, that sounds sensible. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. These old bones don't move as quick as they used to!
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, Mr. Popova. I will begin with your blood pressure. 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, lungs are clear. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Follow my finger with your eyes. Good. No nystagmus. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Some tenderness in the upper trapezius muscles, consistent with strain. No focal neurological deficits noted.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Do you need me to do anything else? All that bendin' and liftin’ with Marcus must have done somethin' to my neck, I reckon. It's good you checked, though. Always best to be sure.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Popova, that will suffice for the examination. Based on my assessment, it appears you are experiencing a mild tension headache, likely exacerbated by muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. Given your age and medical history, and the absence of any concerning neurological findings, I do not believe further investigation is warranted at this time. However, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief as needed, and gentle stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders. Avoid strenuous activity for a few days. And I strongly advise you to delegate the heavy lifting to someone younger. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any questions. I appreciate you explainin’ it so clearly. And you’re right about the liftin’. I should’ve known better. Old bones ain’t what they used to be! I'll be sure to take it easy and let Marcus’s father handle the heavy work. Thank you for your time, Doctor Mutnick.
DOCTOR: Very well. If your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, or changes in vision, seek medical attention immediately. Here is my card. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Try not to overexert yourself, Mr. Popova.
