DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Fazzina. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, I believe. It’s been… a while now, perhaps a few weeks? I apologize, my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased bathroom trips. That’s… good to know. And is it more frequent during the day, or at night, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm. Both, I think. Though… perhaps a little more at night? It’s disruptive, you see. I have to get up. It’s… inconvenient. It's not painful, thankfully, just… a lot. I don’t recall changing anything in my routine that might cause this. Do you… need me to be more specific? I apologize again if I’m being vague.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed, Mr. Verbos. It takes time to explain these things. Both day and night… alright. And when you go, is it a full emptying, or do you feel like you’re still needing to go afterwards?
PATIENT: That's a… good question. Let me think. It feels like a full emptying, yes. But… shortly after, perhaps an hour or so, I feel the urge again. Not a strong urge, mind you, but… noticeable. It’s… rather perplexing. I've tried not drinking so much water before bed, but it hasn’t seemed to make a significant difference. I hope that clarifies things.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling like you need to go again relatively soon after emptying… Alright. And are you noticing any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Now that… I haven’t specifically been looking, Doctor. Is there something I should be looking for? I confess, I mostly just… go. I haven't noticed any color changes, I suppose. It looks… normal, as far as I can tell. Though my vision isn’t the best these days. Would you… perhaps recommend I pay closer attention?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be helpful, Mr. Verbos. If you could try to notice the color - is it lighter or darker than usual?
PATIENT: Alright. Color… I will endeavor to do so. It's… difficult to remember to observe such things, but I’ll try my best. Is there anything else I should be paying attention to? Any… smell, perhaps? I apologize, these are rather personal questions. I just want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, thank you. And yes, smell is good to note. Any unusual odor?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It smells… well, like urine, I suppose. Nothing different than usual. Truly, Doctor, I haven’t detected anything amiss other than the increased frequency. I am starting to worry, naturally. It's just… unsettling to be constantly thinking about where the nearest restroom is. It's limiting. I used to enjoy long walks, but now… I hesitate.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Verbos, and it’s good you came in to discuss it. Limiting your activities isn’t ideal. Okay, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or anything else?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. I believe the doctor mentioned something about pre-diabetes a few years ago, but it wasn't… severe, as I recall. He said to watch my diet, and I tried, but… well, old habits, you know. Aside from that, nothing significant, I don’t think. I had a bout of… shingles a while back, but that’s long resolved. I’m generally quite healthy, or I was, until this started. My mother had… heart problems, if that’s relevant. She lived to a good age, though. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m doing my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a small dose of something for my blood pressure. It’s… a white pill, I believe. I’ve been taking it for several years now, prescribed by my previous doctor. I can’t recall the name, I’m afraid. I have a list at home, I’m certain, but I didn't bring it with me. It’s… a small, family-run pharmacy, so they know me well, if you need to check. I apologize for my lack of… organization.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Verbos. We can always verify the details. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to garden quite a bit, and I certainly handled plenty of plants without issue. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I did have a… bee sting as a child, but it wasn’t serious. Just a bit of swelling, and my mother put some cream on it. Is that relevant, Doctor? I’m trying to be thorough, but my memory… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verbos. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll just check your abdomen and do a brief neurological assessment. It shouldn't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Anything that might help determine the cause is acceptable. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll just feel around gently. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Everything sounds… normal, I’m not hearing any unusual bowel sounds. Now, just a gentle press here… and here… Any pain or tenderness?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all, Doctor. It feels… perfectly normal. A little cold, perhaps, but no pain or discomfort whatsoever. You’re being very gentle, I appreciate that. I confess, I’m always a little apprehensive about these examinations, but you’re putting me at ease.
DOCTOR: Good. No tenderness to palpation… Alright. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes… Your reflexes are… a little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes… Look left… Look right… Look up… Look down… Everything looks… within normal limits. Finally, I'm just going to check your prostate quickly, if you're comfortable with that. It's a routine part of the exam for men your age, and can help rule out certain issues. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. If it’s routine, I trust your judgment entirely. I’d rather be thorough, as you say. It’s… perhaps best to just get it over with, as they say. Please, proceed. I confess, I’m not entirely comfortable with this part, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Everything feels… normal. Prostate is slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness. Okay, Mr. Verbos. Based on the exam, everything feels… relatively normal. The slightly enlarged prostate could be contributing to your frequent urination, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a PSA test, which will check for infection and screen for prostate cancer. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Any tests that might help determine the cause are acceptable. Urinalysis, PSA test, basic metabolic panel… I’ll write that down so I don’t forget. Do I need to schedule another appointment for the results, or will you contact me? And… are these tests expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what will be covered. I apologize for asking about the cost, it's just… a concern.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Verbos, that's a very valid concern. Medicare should cover most of the cost, but there might be a small co-pay. I’ll have the lab submit the claim for you. As for the results, I’d like to see you back in about a week to discuss them. We can schedule that appointment now, or you can call the office at your convenience. I’ll also have the lab fax the results to my office as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to drink about eight glasses of water a day, but avoid drinking anything two hours before bedtime. We’ll see if that makes a difference. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Eight glasses of water, avoid drinking before bed… I can manage that. A week to discuss the results… let’s schedule the appointment now, if you don’t mind. It’s easier to remember that way. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verbos. How does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific symptoms I should be watching for? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, not specifically. Just be aware of any changes in your urine - color, smell, or any blood. And if you experience any pain or fever, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax and follow the advice we discussed. Here’s a lab requisition for the tests. You can take this to any lab that accepts Medicare. Do you have any other questions for me before you go, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate your thoroughness and clear explanations. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
