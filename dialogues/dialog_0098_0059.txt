DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been a bit… off. Hard to explain, really. It feels like I’m not saying things clearly sometimes, and people have been asking me to repeat myself. It’s not constant, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, “speech…off,” difficulty with clarity, and people asking for repetitions. Not constant. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. I honestly can’t pinpoint a specific time. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse over… some time now? Weeks, maybe? It’s not something I actively noticed starting on a particular day, if that makes sense. I just… realized people were giving me strange looks more often. It’s a bit vague, I’m afraid. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. It’s very common for things to develop gradually. We'll try to piece it together. So, weeks… and you've noticed people looking at you strangely – could you give me an example of a situation where this happened?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the other day, I was talking to my husband, Leroy, about… about getting the garden ready for the fall. And he asked me what I meant three times! I was trying to explain about needing to till the soil, and he kept saying “huh?” It was just a normal conversation, but it felt… strained. And I was getting flustered trying to repeat myself. It wasn't a complex thing to say, I don't think. I felt a bit silly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, strained conversation with your husband, difficulty conveying a simple thought… and you felt flustered. Do you notice this more often when you're tired, or stressed, or is it fairly consistent regardless of how you're feeling?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I think it's worse when I’m tired, definitely. Work’s been pretty demanding lately, lots of long days on the site. And when I’m stressed, it seems to get harder to… form the words properly. So, yes, both tiredness and stress seem to make it more noticeable. When I’m relaxed, it’s not as bad, but it doesn't completely disappear, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Tiredness and stress are definitely factors that can worsen speech. Now, aside from your husband noticing, has anyone else commented on your speech?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, old Miss Petunia down the street asked me to repeat myself when I was chatting about the church bazaar last week. She's a bit hard of hearing, though, so I didn't really think much of it at the time. But… thinking back, it was a bit more effort to get her to understand. And one of the foremen at work, Mr. Davis, looked confused when I was explaining something about the blueprints. But he’s always a bit distracted, so… I’m not sure if that counts. It’s mostly been Leroy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly Leroy, but some instances with Miss Petunia and Mr. Davis. Has this difficulty with speech been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think carefully. No, not that I've noticed. No headaches, no dizziness, no… weakness. My hands haven’t been shaking any more than usual. I haven’t had any trouble swallowing. Um… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else really. I feel… normal, apart from the speech thing. It’s just… worrying, you know? It’s not like me to stumble over my words.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Adyn. It is good that you haven’t noticed any other symptoms, that’s reassuring. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any recent injuries to your head or neck?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I’m very careful on the construction site, and I haven't had any falls or bumps to the head. Leroy always jokes that I'm too cautious, but I prefer it that way. No injuries, definitely. I pride myself on being careful. It's a dangerous job, you need to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. Given what you've told me, it sounds like we’re dealing with a gradual onset of speech difficulty, worsened by fatigue and stress, with no other neurological symptoms or recent injury. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A physical exam sounds perfectly alright. Do tell me what you'll be doing, if you don’t mind? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll just be checking your cranial nerves – that involves looking at your eyes, listening to your speech more closely, testing your reflexes, and a quick assessment of your muscle strength. It shouldn’t take too long, and it won't be uncomfortable. First, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem at all. There you go, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m a bit nearsighted, you know, so I'm concentrating to keep it steady.
DOCTOR: Very good, Adyn. Eyes are tracking smoothly. Now, could you open and close your eyes tightly for me, and then resist as I try to gently close them?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s easy enough. There. Is that alright, Doctor? I can feel my muscles working.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Good strength there. Now, I’m going to listen to your speech. Could you read this sentence aloud for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Is that alright, Doctor? I was trying to be very clear. It feels a bit strange reading something you haven't seen before.
DOCTOR: That was very good, Adyn. It sounded clear enough, although I did notice a slight pause on a few words. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you relax your arms for me?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. Just let me know what you’re doing. I do get a bit nervous when people tap on my knees, it's a silly thing, I know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, many people feel that way. I’ll be quick. Good reflexes. Now, just a quick assessment of your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m trying to grip as hard as I can without hurting you. I used to help my father with carpentry, so my hands are fairly strong.
DOCTOR: Very good. Good strength there, too. Alright, Adyn, everything seems normal on the basic neurological exam. However, given your report of speech difficulty, and to rule out any underlying causes, I would like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes. And, just to be thorough, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. It’s the best way to visualize any potential issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Well, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. A bit daunting, I must admit. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Complete blood count and a metabolic panel sound fine, and an MRI if you feel it’s important. It's just… I'm not a fan of enclosed spaces, if I’m honest. Is it a very long procedure? And will I need someone to drive me?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Adyn. Many people feel anxious about MRIs. It’s a relatively painless procedure, though it does require you to lie still for about 30-45 minutes inside the scanner. It can be a bit noisy, so we’ll give you earplugs. And yes, you will absolutely need someone to drive you home, as we administer a contrast dye that can temporarily affect your ability to drive. We'll go over the details of the dye before the scan. The main purpose of the MRI is to rule out anything serious, like a stroke, tumor, or multiple sclerosis. We'll get the results back in a few days, and I'll call you to discuss them as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some speech therapy. It can help strengthen the muscles involved in speech and improve clarity. Would you be interested in a referral to a speech therapist?
PATIENT: Speech therapy… That sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it will help, then yes, please. A referral to a speech therapist would be very much appreciated. And yes, I understand about needing a driver for the MRI. It's good to know all the details. I'll arrange that, then. And I'll wait for your call with the results. Thank you, Doctor Bombara. You've put my mind at ease a little, even if it’s just knowing what we're looking for. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. I’ll write you a referral for speech therapy and the order for the MRI. You should receive a call from the radiology department to schedule the scan. I'll also send you home with instructions about preparing for the MRI. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty swallowing, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. Thank you again for your time. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’ll be in touch soon with the results. Have a good day!
