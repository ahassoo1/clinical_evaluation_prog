DOCTOR: Right. Blain Theriot, 24 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mom… she had some things. Heart stuff, mostly. And her sister, too. It’s just… always something with them. I don’t want to end up like them, you know? I’m trying to be proactive, I guess. Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: Proactive… yes, well, people say that. Look, a family history is… relevant, I suppose. But “something” isn’t a diagnosis. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Okay. My mom had… angina, I think? And then she had a stent put in. Her sister had a… a blockage, I think. Something with cholesterol, really high numbers. They both ended up having to change their diets completely. I just… I feel fine, but it's always in the back of my head. Like a ticking time bomb, maybe? I eat pretty healthy, I think. Mostly. I do like takeout sometimes. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Takeout. Right. So, you're experiencing… anxiety about a potential inherited cardiac risk. No current symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Nothing at all. I just… I don't want to wait until something is wrong, you know? It’s better to just check, right? My ex-wife always said I worried too much, but she wasn't the one with a family full of heart problems. And honestly, she didn't understand preventative care. She'd just wait until she was practically dying before going to the doctor. It was… frustrating. So yeah, just checking. Is there a test or something?
DOCTOR: “Checking” is… broad. We could run some basic labs, a cholesterol panel, perhaps an EKG. Though frankly, with no symptoms, it feels… unnecessary. But, alright. We’ll indulge your… concerns. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: No allergies. And it’s not just concerns, okay? It's risk assessment. It's responsible. My mom kept saying she was fine until… well, until she wasn’t. And then it was too late. So yes, please. Labs, EKG, whatever you think is necessary to… to prove I’m not about to keel over like a tree. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Fine. We will proceed with labs and an EKG. I'll have the nurse draw blood and get you set up. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in relying on pills unless it's absolutely necessary. My ex-wife was on, like, five different things. It was… a whole ordeal. Honestly, I think a good diet and exercise are usually enough. But, okay, labs and EKG. Whatever. Just… try not to take too much blood, please? I get lightheaded easily.
DOCTOR: The nurse will handle that. And “enough” is subjective. We'll see what the results say. While we're waiting, let's get a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs. Routine. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But I have to say, this feels a bit… excessive for just wanting some reassurance. It’s not like I’m presenting with chest pain or anything. Is this what everyone gets? Even if they just want to be… careful? I’m starting to feel a little… anxious now, actually. Which defeats the whole purpose, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Mr. Theriot. It's about establishing a baseline, not assuming imminent collapse. Please, relax. I need to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Deep breath. It’s just… I really don't like doctors. Too much poking and prodding. And the waiting is the worst part. It gives you too much time to think. And when I think, I start worrying again. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Height is 181 cm, weight 60 kg. BMI is… low end of normal. Normal findings so far. The nurse will be in shortly with the lab requisition. Try to remain calm.
PATIENT: Low end of normal? Is that… bad? I eat pretty well. I mean, I like takeout sometimes, but I also eat a lot of vegetables. And I walk a lot. I walk everywhere, actually. So I don't understand what's low end of normal about that. Maybe I should eat more… I don't know, steak? Does that help? This is ridiculous. I’m getting more stressed just being here.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Theriot. Just… an observation. We'll have a more informed discussion once the lab results are available. Focus on not self-diagnosing based on vague anxieties. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
