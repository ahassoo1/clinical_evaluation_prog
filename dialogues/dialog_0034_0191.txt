DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I wanted to do, just to be sure, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. It’s very responsible of you to prioritize your health and seek testing. I understand wanting to have peace of mind. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to gather a bit more information to understand your risk factors and ensure we provide you with the best possible care. Would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history and any potential exposures?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, ask away. I have no problem answering what you need to know. I want to be thorough, as you say.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shaub. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. I've had the usual things – colds, flu, a bit of arthritis in my knees, but nothing a doctor ever said was… chronic, you understand. Just the normal aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. My husband always says I worry too much, but better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. It’s always better to be proactive about your health. And aches and pains are common as we age. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was still living in Nigeria, I had my appendix removed. And… oh, let me see… when I came to the States, I had a small growth taken off my arm. It wasn’t anything serious, just a little skin thing, the doctor said. That was… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful information. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from a fever, they said. And my father, he lived to be a very old man, but I don’t really remember any specific illnesses he had. We weren’t very close, and my family back home… we don’t keep in touch as much as we should. I’m afraid I don’t have much information on that front. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Shaub. Family history can be difficult to gather. We can proceed without detailed information if that’s the case. Now, to get a better understanding of your risk factors for HIV, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly? I mean, I’m married, have been for… goodness, forty years now! And I don't go to a lot of parties, if that's what you mean. We mostly keep to ourselves, my husband and I. Are you asking about… things I’ve done? I’m not sure I understand.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shaub, please don’t be alarmed. "Social history" is just a medical term for gathering information about your lifestyle and behaviors that could impact your health. It includes things like your marital status – which you’ve already kindly shared – and also questions about sexual activity, and any history of intravenous drug use. It's a routine part of a medical assessment, and all information is kept confidential. I understand it can be a sensitive topic, and you are not obligated to share anything you are uncomfortable with. However, this information does help us to assess your risk and ensure we provide you with the most appropriate care and testing. Would you be comfortable answering a few questions about your sexual history, or would you prefer to skip that section?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Well, that’s… that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? My husband and I… we’ve been together a very long time. We haven’t… we haven’t had any other partners. Not in many, many years. And certainly not any… risky behavior. Is that what you’re asking about? I’m just… I’m not used to doctors asking such things. It feels a bit intrusive, if you don’t mind my saying so. I hope you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Shaub, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. It's routine, but I recognize it’s a sensitive topic. Knowing you've been in a long-term, monogamous relationship for many years significantly lowers your risk. Given that information, and to be thorough, have you ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never. I wouldn’t even consider such a thing. I’ve never used… those things. My husband and I both take good care of our health. We have our vaccinations, we eat reasonably well… we’re just sensible people, Doctor. Is there anything else? I’m a bit anxious about this testing, you see. The thought of… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Shaub. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing a medical test, especially one that carries such weight. Based on what you’ve told me – a long-term, monogamous relationship, no history of intravenous drug use, and a commitment to preventative health – your risk of HIV is very low. Before we proceed with the test itself, let’s quickly review your allergies and current medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but I haven’t been stung in decades! I don’t take any medications regularly. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my knees are particularly bad, but that's just over-the-counter ibuprofen. Nothing prescribed, you understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shaub. That’s very helpful. So, no known allergies and only occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, before we move on to the physical exam and the testing process, I want to ensure you’re comfortable and understand what to expect. The HIV test typically involves a simple blood draw. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results usually take a few days to come back. We will contact you directly with the results, and we can discuss them in detail at that time. Do you have any questions about the testing process itself?
PATIENT: A blood draw? Oh dear. I don’t particularly like needles, Doctor. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose I can manage. How much blood do they need? And will it hurt a lot? I always get a bit faint, you see. Is there anything I can do to prepare? Perhaps I should have had something to eat beforehand?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be apprehensive about needles, Ms. Shaub. We'll take things slowly and make sure you're as comfortable as possible. The amount of blood we need is relatively small – usually just a few vials. As for the pain, most people only feel a quick pinch. The phlebotomist – the person drawing the blood – is very skilled and will minimize any discomfort. You are right to think about having something to eat beforehand. Having a small snack and drinking plenty of water can help prevent you from feeling faint. I'll let the phlebotomist know you’re anxious and prone to feeling faint, and they will take extra precautions. We also have a comfortable chair where you can sit afterwards, and we can offer you a cool compress if needed. Would you like me to explain the physical exam I'm planning to perform before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Just tell me what you’re going to do. I like to know what to expect, you see. I don't want any surprises. Knowing… it helps me calm down a bit. Is it a thorough exam? Will you be… listening to my chest, or looking in my ears? I'm a bit self-conscious, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I completely understand wanting to know what to expect, and I'll explain everything as we go. The physical exam will be relatively brief. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I’ll also take a quick look in your ears and throat. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes – gently feel for any swelling in your neck, armpits, and groin. This is a routine part of assessing your overall health and looking for any signs of infection. I will not be performing a pelvic or rectal exam today. Is that all right with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. As long as it's not too intrusive, I suppose. I’m just… I’ve never had a doctor feel all over my neck before. But if you say it’s routine, I trust your judgment. Very well. Let's get it over with, shall we? The sooner it's done, the sooner I'll know one way or the other. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. We'll take things at your pace. It will likely only take a few minutes, and I’ll explain each step as I go. Could we have a phlebotomist in here, please?
PATIENT: .
