DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It says here you’re 65 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, 65, going on… well, never mind that. I keep getting fevers, see? Comes and goes. It's been… a while now. It's just annoying, really. Nothin' seems to stay gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, fevers that come and go. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, they don't get too high, not like when my kids were little and had the flu. Just kinda warm, you know? Maybe 101, 102 on a bad day. And they usually stick around for… a day, maybe a little more. Then they’re gone for a week, two weeks, then back again. It's been happening for…oh, I dunno, maybe six months now? Longer? I don't keep real good track of dates. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Six months, okay. That's helpful. And you said 101, 102 on a bad day. Do you take your temperature at home, and if so, how?
PATIENT: Yeah, I got one of those digital ones, you stick it in your mouth. My wife makes me take it when she thinks I'm lookin' flushed. She worries. I try to do it myself when I feel it comin’ on, just to keep the peace. It's usually pretty accurate, I think. Though sometimes I wonder if it's just wishful thinkin'.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're monitoring it, even if it's a little uncertain. Besides the fevers, have you noticed any other symptoms when they happen?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes I get a little tired, achy. Like I pulled somethin', but not really. Mostly just… crummy. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin' like that. Just… bleh. And a little thirsty sometimes. But I'm always thirsty, livin' in this heat. I guess that’s it, really. Nothin' major.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, achiness, and feeling generally unwell with the fevers. And the thirst is consistent, so that’s good to know. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Nah, I don't think so. My wife does most of the cookin', and I still eat pretty good. Maybe a pound or two, but I put that down to the weather. It's been scorchin' out here, takes the appetite away sometimes. I ain’t exactly a skinny fella, either. Always been… solid, you could say.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's understandable with the heat. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' serious. The doctor always tells me my blood pressure's a little high, but he says it's just age. And my back… well, I'm a chiropractor, remember? Always somethin' achin' in this back. But no real illnesses, nothin' they ever gave me pills for long-term. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? I try to fix myself, mostly. That's why I got into this business, ha!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And it makes sense you'd try to manage things yourself being a chiropractor. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never been under the knife. I stay away from hospitals if I can. Too many germs, you know? Always tell my wife, “If I gotta go to a hospital, it’s gotta be an emergency!” I prefer to…adjust things on my own, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And that's perfectly alright. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father had heart trouble, towards the end. He smoked too much, though. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don't really remember the details. My mother was always pretty private about things. Mostly, we were a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father and possible stomach cancer in your aunt. That’s helpful to know. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that mean? You mean like, do I go to parties? I mostly stay home with my wife, watch the ball games. I used to fish a lot, but my back ain’t what it used to be. I quit smokin’ years ago, thank goodness. And I don't drink much, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. Not a big social butterfly, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. No heavy smoking or drinking, mostly quiet evenings at home. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – like foods, pollen, or animals?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I'm pretty lucky that way. I can eat just about anything. My wife tried to get me to take some allergy pills once, said I was sneezin' a lot during the spring. But they made me drowsy, so I stopped takin' 'em. I just deal with the sneezes, it's not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And that's good. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my back sometimes, when it’s really botherin’ me. Ibuprofen, the regular stuff you get at the drugstore. And sometimes, when I’m really achin', I’ll take some… well, some stuff my colleague sells, it’s got glucosamine and chondroitin in it. Helps with the joints, he says. That's about it, really. Nothin' the doctor prescribed, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a supplement with glucosamine and chondroitin. Thank you for all of that information, Mr. Brege. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide. Just try to be gentle with my back, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be very gentle. If you could please have a seat here, we'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your abdomen and take your temperature. After that, I'll take a look at your back, very carefully. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, let's check your abdomen. I'm just going to gently press on different areas. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation, and no masses that I can feel. Now, let's take your temperature. Your temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit. A little elevated, but not significantly. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Please let me know if anything is painful. There's some muscle tenderness in your lower back, which is not surprising given your profession. No signs of any other abnormalities. Okay, Mr. Brege. Everything seems relatively normal on physical exam, but the persistent fevers and muscle aches are concerning. Given your age and symptoms, I think it's important to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds sensible. What kinda things are we talkin' about? I ain’t scared of a little bloodwork, but I don't wanna be poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We'll start with some basic bloodwork. I want to check your complete blood count to look for signs of infection or inflammation. We'll also check your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and a sedimentation rate to see if there's any overall inflammation in your body. We should also check a thyroid stimulating hormone level, just to rule out any thyroid issues. I also want to order a urinalysis to check for a possible urinary tract infection. These are all routine tests, and they’ll give us a good starting point. Depending on the results, we might need to do some additional testing later, but let's start with these first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds… thorough. All that bloodwork… I guess it's gotta be done. Just tell me where to go to get it done, and how long it'll take. And will you explain the results to me? I don’t want any fancy medical talk, just… plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything in plain English, I promise. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist will draw your blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, and then it takes a few days for the results to come back – typically 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms – like a cough, shortness of breath, or severe pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just call me when you got the results. And thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen. I guess I'll head home then. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brege. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And please, take it easy. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
