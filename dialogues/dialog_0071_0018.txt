DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Verbos. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, you understand. It’s been… a while now. Perhaps a few weeks? It's hard to say, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent urination… a few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few weeks, give or take. It’s not… painful, not exactly. Just… a constant urge. And quite a bit each time, if that makes sense. It's disrupting my routine a little. I find myself… planning around it, you see. It’s rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not painful, just a frequent and urgent need to go, and it's impacting your daily life. And a good amount each time, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A good amount. More than… normal, I believe. I drink a fair bit of water, I always have, but this feels… different. I don't recall anything like this before. Perhaps it’s simply age? I’m not sure. Is that a possibility, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be related to age, Mr. Verbos, but there are a number of things that can cause frequent urination. We need to rule a few things out. Just to get a better picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I haven’t noticed anything… significant. I suppose I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, but I attributed that to the warmer weather. And, now that I mention it, perhaps a bit more tired lately, but I’ve been working in the garden quite a bit. Is that… relevant? I really can't recall feeling particularly unwell, other than this… situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased thirst and fatigue. Working in the garden could certainly contribute to fatigue, yes. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I had my appendix removed many years ago, when I was quite young. And I believe I had a bout of pneumonia once, a very long time ago. Other than that… nothing comes to mind immediately. I’ve always considered myself quite healthy, to be honest. I do have Medicare, if that's relevant. I suppose they’d have a record of anything significant, wouldn’t they?
DOCTOR: Medicare would certainly have a record. Let me just take a quick look… Alright, I see the appendectomy from… 1978, and pneumonia in 1985. Otherwise, it appears relatively clean. Any family history of… diabetes, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Diabetes… My mother… I believe she had something along those lines. Not diabetes exactly, but a condition that required her to be quite careful with her diet. She had to watch her sugar intake, very closely. She passed away many years ago, so my recollection is… hazy, I’m afraid. As for kidney problems… no, not that I’m aware of. My father was remarkably robust, never a sick day in his life. Though, he did enjoy his schnapps, perhaps a bit too much. Is that pertinent, Doctor? I apologize for my rambling; it's simply difficult to organize my thoughts.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Verbos. It’s perfectly alright. A family history of dietary concerns, that’s helpful to know. Alright. And just a few more quick questions. What about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I take nothing regularly, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. Occasionally, an aspirin for a headache, but that's infrequent. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if you understand. I find a good night’s sleep and a cup of chamomile tea does wonders for most ailments. No prescriptions, no supplements… nothing at all. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check, nothing to worry about. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your abdomen and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment entirely. I've always believed in the importance of a thorough examination. Please, proceed. I'll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally for me, Mr. Verbos. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That doesn’t feel particularly uncomfortable. A little pressure, naturally, but nothing… alarming. It feels quite normal, to be honest. Perhaps a bit… sensitive, but that could simply be gas. I had a rather large cabbage for dinner last night. I do enjoy my vegetables, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No tenderness to report. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And the other side… Reflexes seem normal. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, and your pulse is 72. Weight is 141 pounds. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. No food allergies, no allergies to plants or animals… nothing at all. My wife, bless her soul, used to say I had the constitution of an ox. Though, that was many years ago. But no, no allergies, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it doesn’t seem to be anything immediately serious, but frequent urination can be caused by a number of things. It could be related to age, as you mentioned, or simply drinking too much fluid. However, given your family history and the fact that this has been going on for a few weeks, I think we should run some tests to rule out other possibilities. Specifically, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood sugar test. Just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’d much rather be safe than sorry, as they say. A urine analysis and a blood sugar test… yes, absolutely. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause of this… inconvenience. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem appropriate. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast for the blood sugar test?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m ordering those tests now. You will need to fast for the blood sugar test – no food or drink after midnight tonight. We can draw the blood first thing in the morning, and you can provide a urine sample then as well. The lab usually has results back within a few days, so I expect to have them by the end of the week. Here's the requisition form. Take this to the lab in the morning. And, to be on the safe side, try reducing your fluid intake slightly over the next few days and see if that makes a difference. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. Fast after midnight, reduce fluid intake, and bring this form to the lab. I believe I have it all. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with my… vagueness. I do tend to ramble, don't I? I'll follow your instructions carefully. And I'll be sure to call if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. And don't worry about rambling, it's perfectly normal. Just take care, and we'll talk soon. Have a good day.
