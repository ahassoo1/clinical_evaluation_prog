DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re eighteen years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. And the nurse told me it has something to do with my heart, something about it beating… funny? I don’t really understand it all, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite unsettling when you’re not sure what’s going on. The nurse mentioned some swelling in your left leg and concern about your heart rhythm, which is a good starting point. To help me understand what’s happening, could you tell me a little more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started a couple of days ago, I think. It’s just… bigger. My left leg feels heavy, and it looks different from my other one. It doesn’t hurt badly, just… uncomfortable. I noticed it after I was standing for a long time at the bus stop, waiting to go to town.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Kreckel. So, the swelling began a couple of days ago and you noticed it after prolonged standing. It feels heavy and uncomfortable, but not acutely painful. Is the swelling confined to your left leg, or has it spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, it’s just the left leg. Nothing else. I checked my other leg and my feet and ankles, and they seem fine. It's just… that one leg. I was a bit worried it might be a bug bite at first, but it doesn’t look like one, and it hasn’t gone down.
DOCTOR: I see. And you haven't noticed any redness, warmth, or changes in the skin texture on that leg?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The skin feels… normal, I think. Maybe a tiny bit tighter, now that you mention it, but not really warm or red. It just looks bigger, that’s all. I haven’t noticed any pain in the leg itself, just the heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit tired lately, but I thought that was just from studying. And sometimes I feel… a bit fluttery in my chest. Like my heart is doing a little dance. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But it’s a bit worrying. Does that have anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kreckel. The fatigue and the sensation of fluttering in your chest – what we call palpitations – are both important things to note. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, a doctor told me a while ago that my heart wasn’t beating… regularly. He said something about atrial… fibrilla- something? It was a bit complicated. He didn’t give me any medicine for it, just said to keep an eye on it. That was a couple of years ago, maybe. Other than that, I haven't really been to the doctor much. I'm usually quite healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. So, you have a history of atrial fibrillation identified a couple of years ago, but were not prescribed any medication at that time. That’s very important information. Do you recall if you had any testing done to confirm the diagnosis, such as an EKG or echocardiogram?
PATIENT: I… think so. I remember something about wires and a machine. And they had me lie down. But I was quite young then, and I don't really remember what they were looking for. The doctor just said my heart beat a bit… fast and uneven sometimes. He didn’t explain much, to be honest. I've just been trying to ignore it, as I didn't really feel any different most of the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be overwhelming to process medical information, especially when you’re younger. It’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention now. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mum has high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side, he had something with his heart as well, but I don't know exactly what. He passed away a few years ago. Other than that, I don’t really know much about anyone else’s medical history. We don't really talk about it much in my family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. History of high blood pressure in your mother and heart problems in your grandfather are good things to note. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I'm a student, so I do quite a lot of studying. I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk. I try to eat fairly healthy, but I do enjoy a bit of cake now and then. I don't really exercise much, I'm afraid. I walk to school sometimes, but that’s about it. And I don’t smoke or drink alcohol. I do drink a lot of coffee to help me stay awake while I’m studying, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kreckel. That gives me a good overview of your situation. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. I will start by checking your vital signs—your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature—and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I will examine your left leg more closely, comparing it to your right leg to assess the swelling and look for any other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to be still. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your heart rate is 88 and irregular, and your temperature is normal. The capillary refill is normal in both legs. The skin temperature is normal, but as I mentioned, there is a noticeable difference in circumference. I am also able to feel a slight firmness to the tissues in your lower left leg. The pulses in both legs are present, but the pulse in your left leg is slightly weaker than in your right leg. There is no pain with range of motion, but I do note some mild tenderness upon palpation of the calf muscle in your left leg. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the findings of this examination, I suspect the swelling in your left leg may be related to a blood clot, although further testing is needed to confirm this diagnosis. We need to rule out Deep Vein Thrombosis, or DVT.
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it very bad? What kind of testing do you need to do? And will it… go away? I'm a bit worried now. I didn't realise my heart problem could cause something like this.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Kreckel. A blood clot can be serious, but we’re going to investigate it thoroughly and get you the appropriate care. Atrial fibrillation can indeed increase the risk of blood clots forming, particularly in the legs. The testing we need to do is an ultrasound of your left leg – a Doppler ultrasound, to be precise. It uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins and identify any clots that may be present. It’s a painless, non-invasive procedure. In the meantime, I want to take some precautions. We’ll need to start you on a blood thinner medication to prevent the clot from growing larger and to reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs, which could be very dangerous. I will write you a prescription for Apixaban, a commonly used anticoagulant. I will also recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I haven't taken much medication before, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything. Apixaban… that sounds like a complicated name to remember. Will it make me feel unwell? And how long will I need to take it for? It's just… I'm a bit anxious about taking something I haven't heard of before. And what happens if I forget to take it?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Kreckel. Apixaban is a commonly prescribed medication, and while all medications have potential side effects, most people tolerate it very well. The most common side effect is a slightly increased risk of bleeding, so it’s important to be aware of that. We'll discuss signs of bleeding to watch for, like unusual bruising, prolonged nosebleeds, or blood in your urine or stool. The duration of treatment will depend on the results of the ultrasound and the underlying cause of the clot. If it’s confirmed that you have a DVT related to your atrial fibrillation, you’ll likely need to be on a blood thinner long-term, possibly indefinitely, to prevent future clots. Regarding forgetting to take it, it’s important to take it as prescribed. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it’s almost time for your next dose. If it's close to the next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not double your dose to make up for a missed one. It’s helpful to set a reminder on your phone or use a pill organizer to help you remember. I will also provide you with a detailed information sheet about Apixaban and answer any further questions you may have. I will also schedule the ultrasound for you today. Are you able to go to the imaging center this afternoon?
PATIENT: Yes, I think I can go this afternoon. Setting a reminder on my phone is a good idea. It's just… a lot to take in, all of a sudden. So, if it is a blood clot, and I have to take this medicine for a long time… what about my studies? And can I still walk to school? I’m worried it will stop me from doing things. And… will it hurt? The blood clot, I mean. It doesn't hurt now, but I'm scared it will.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kreckel. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let’s address your questions one by one. Regarding your studies, taking Apixaban shouldn’t interfere with your ability to study. You may need to be mindful of potential bleeding, especially if you participate in activities that carry a risk of injury, but otherwise, you should be able to continue as normal. As for walking to school, light activity like walking is generally encouraged, as it helps improve circulation and prevent further clot formation. However, we’ll need to avoid strenuous activity or anything that could cause trauma to your leg. Regarding pain, a DVT doesn't always cause pain. In fact, many people don’t experience any symptoms at all. However, some people may experience aching, cramping, or swelling in the affected leg. If you do experience any new or worsening pain, it’s important to let me know immediately. We will monitor you closely, and I will provide you with clear instructions on what to do if you experience any complications. I will also provide you with a referral to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – for further evaluation and management, if necessary. Here's what I'm going to do now: I'll write you a prescription for Apixaban and the order for the Doppler Ultrasound. I'll also print out some information about DVT and Apixaban. Do you have any other questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a bit better knowing what's going on. I still feel a bit anxious, but I'm glad we're getting it checked out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my worries. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kreckel. I’m glad I could ease your anxiety a little. It’s important to remember that we're here to support you through this. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns, even after the ultrasound. I will have the nurse schedule your ultrasound and provide you with the necessary paperwork. Take care, and please, prioritize rest and elevate your left leg as much as possible. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. .
