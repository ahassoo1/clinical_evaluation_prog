DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, well… my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you know? But it feels… tight sometimes. Like someone is sitting on it, maybe? It started a couple weeks ago, I think. Around July 15th, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tightness in your chest, starting around July 15th. Can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like if you fall down. It’s… a heavy feeling. And it feels… in the middle of my chest, right here. Sometimes it goes up to my neck a little bit, but mostly right here. It doesn’t go down my arm, no. It just… is there. And when I walk up the stairs, it gets worse. Much worse.
DOCTOR: Heavy feeling, localized to the mid-sternal area, radiating slightly to the neck, not down the arm. Exacerbated by exertion – specifically, walking up stairs. Do you feel any shortness of breath with this tightness, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, a little. Not always, but when the chest feels really tight, it’s hard to get a good breath. Like I'm… puffing, you know? I have to stop and catch my breath sometimes. It doesn't happen every time, but… when it’s bad, yes. It’s scary. Not like I can’t breathe at all, but… hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific triggered these episodes, besides walking up stairs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so, not really. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting, watching TV. Other times it happens after I've been… doing something around the house, like cleaning. It doesn't seem to matter much. It just… comes. I was making dinner last week, and it started then, too. I was chopping vegetables, I remember that. It’s just… random, I guess.
DOCTOR: Random onset, occurring with both rest and exertion. Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Let’s get some more background information. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother… she had the pressure. High blood pressure, yes. I had it too, a little bit, a few years ago. The doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it. It made me feel dizzy, you know? And… no, I don't have the sugar. No diabetes. Never. My cholesterol… I don’t know. I think it was okay last time, but I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago. I’m Medicare, so… they checked things. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’ll look into that. You mentioned stopping a medication for high blood pressure due to dizziness. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I take one for my arthritis. It’s… Meloxicam, I think. Yes, Meloxicam. One a day. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, I take Tylenol, but not every day. Just when I need it. And… vitamins. Just a regular one, you know? The kind old people take. It has all the letters in it. A, C, E… everything. It's yellow. It’s small and yellow.
DOCTOR: Meloxicam daily for arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything! My husband, he’s allergic to shellfish, but I can eat anything. I've never had a reaction to a pill or anything. Never. We live in Florida, you know, and I eat mangoes all the time! I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Not really. I’ve been eating the same things my whole life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… oh! And I had a baby, so I was in the hospital for that! But that was… a long time ago, too. A very long time ago. Other than that, no. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything else. No surgeries, no… nothing. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood, delivery of a baby. Let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Like I said, my mother had the pressure, high blood pressure. And… my father, he had a problem with his heart. Something with the rhythm, I think. He had to take pills for it, too. And… my aunt, on my husband's side, she had the sugar. Diabetes, yes. And… my uncle, he had cancer. Lung cancer, a long time ago. He smoked too much. It’s a lot, I guess. A lot of sickness in my family.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia in mother, diabetes in aunt, lung cancer in uncle. Alright. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no smoking! Never! My husband used to smoke, but he stopped a long time ago. And… I don’t drink much. Sometimes, with dinner, a little glass of wine. But not every night. Just… sometimes. And… no, no drugs! Never! I am a good Colombian woman. I like to cook and I like to dance. That is my fun.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My husband always says I worry too much. He says I need to let the doctors do their job. So yes, please. Check everything. Just… tell me what you think, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Chelberg… and exhale. I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, and a mild murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this time, but something we'll keep an eye on. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is elevated at 148/92. Pulse is regular and strong at 88 beats per minute. Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Your blood pressure is a little high, and I did hear a murmur with your heartbeat. Given your symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and the family history of heart issues, I’m concerned about possible angina or early signs of heart disease. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. I also want to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to look at the electrical activity of your heart, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a lot. Angina? Is that bad, Doctor? My husband… he has a heart problem, too, you know? He takes pills. Is that what you think I have? The tests sound… scary. But… if you think it's important, yes. Please do the tests. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I don't want to be surprised, like I said. So yes, please. Do everything you think is necessary. And… can you tell me what this means? Just… in simple words? No doctor words, okay? Just… what’s going on with my chest?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg, I understand your concern. Let's take this one step at a time. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It's not necessarily life-threatening in itself, but it is a warning sign that something isn't quite right, and needs to be investigated. Think of it like a warning light on your car – it doesn't mean the car is broken, but it tells you to check it out. The tests will give us more information to determine the cause of your chest tightness. The EKG looks at the electrical activity of your heart to see if there are any abnormalities. The chest X-ray will rule out any problems with your lungs. The blood tests will check your cholesterol levels, and other factors that can contribute to heart disease. We're not diagnosing anything at this point, Ms. Chelberg. We're simply gathering information. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood for you now, and then we’ll get you set up for the EKG and chest X-ray. It’s a standard procedure, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained it very well, Doctor. Like the car, you said. That makes sense. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I have to see a specialist if something is wrong? My husband… he sees a cardiologist. Will I have to see a cardiologist, too? I just want to know what to expect. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The EKG results will be available almost immediately. The chest X-ray results usually take a few hours. If the results show any abnormalities, we may need to consult with a specialist – a cardiologist, as you mentioned. A cardiologist specializes in heart health, and they can provide more in-depth evaluation and treatment if necessary. However, we will discuss the results together, and make a plan that's right for you. We’re not jumping to any conclusions at this point, Ms. Chelberg. We're just gathering information, and then we'll see what the next steps are. For now, I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood, and then schedule you for the EKG and chest X-ray. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, and if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No hard work. And go to the hospital if it gets bad. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just… I get worried easily. My husband says so. But thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It’s perfectly normal to be worried. We’re here to help, and we’ll take good care of you. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
