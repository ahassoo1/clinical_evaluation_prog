DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I believe, around the beginning of July. It’s primarily in my left leg, though occasionally I feel a slight tingling in my right. The numbness itself isn’t constant. It comes and goes, and the intensity varies. Sometimes it’s just a…a dull feeling, like my leg is asleep, and other times it’s more pronounced, almost like a pins-and-needles sensation. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it started in early July, mostly in the left leg, with some occasional tingling in the right. It’s come and goes, varying in intensity from a dull feeling to pins and needles. Alright. And is this numbness associated with any particular activities or positions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve noticed it’s more common after I’ve been standing for long periods, particularly when I’m working on set. I do special effects and animation, so there’s a fair amount of that. Also, if I’m sitting with my legs crossed for an extended time, it seems to trigger it. It doesn’t seem to be directly related to what I’m doing, so much as how I’m positioned. I haven't noticed it happening when I’m lying down, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's triggered by prolonged standing, especially at work, and sitting with your legs crossed. It's not present when lying down. And just to be clear, when you say "work," you're doing special effects and animation... is that mostly computer work, or do you have a lot of physical setup involved?
PATIENT: It’s a bit of both, actually. The animation is primarily computer-based, yes, but the special effects work involves a lot of physical setup—props, lighting, sometimes even small-scale pyrotechnics. So I’m moving around quite a bit, lifting things, adjusting equipment. There’s also a fair amount of time spent crouching or kneeling to get the right angles for shots. It’s not heavy lifting, necessarily, but it’s…dynamic, I suppose is the word.
DOCTOR: Alright, dynamic work involving both computer work and physical setup. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg at all, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No weakness, and my walking is perfectly normal. I haven’t stumbled or felt unsteady or anything like that. The numbness is… unsettling, certainly, but it hasn’t affected my ability to move around or do my job. It’s purely a sensory issue, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No weakness or difficulty walking, just the sensory issue of numbness. Have you experienced any pain in your leg or back, or any changes in bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No pain in either my leg or back. No changes in bowel or bladder function either. I haven’t noticed anything unusual there. It really is just the numbness, and the occasional tingling. I did mention the tingling, right? Sometimes I forget what I’ve already said.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did mention the tingling. No need to worry about repeating things, Tarin. We'll cover everything. So, no pain, no changes in bowel or bladder function, just the numbness and tingling. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No diagnosed medical conditions. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a child, but that was many years ago, and I fully recovered. No allergies to medications or anything like that either. I don’t take any regular medications. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever if I get a headache, but that’s about it. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know – generally healthy, no chronic conditions, no allergies, and no regular medications. Pneumonia as a child, but fully recovered. Excellent. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. The pneumonia was the only hospitalization. No surgeries, no other major illnesses or injuries. I've broken a few bones playing sports when I was younger – a wrist and an ankle – but those healed without complication. It's all been fairly minor, honestly. I'm usually pretty careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Just the broken wrist and ankle as a child. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother’s side of the family has a history of arthritis, specifically rheumatoid arthritis, but it’s mostly women. My father’s side… he wasn’t very close with his family, so I don’t have much information. He passed away a few years ago. I know he had high blood pressure, but that's about it. It's not a very detailed family history, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of rheumatoid arthritis on your mother's side, and high blood pressure in your father. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with friends – but very moderately. I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have. I take fairly good care of myself, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I want to get this sorted out as soon as possible, so whatever you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, Tarin, your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in both legs. And sensation is intact to light touch and pinprick. However, I do notice some decreased sensation to light touch on the lateral aspect of your left lower leg. It's subtle, but it's there. It doesn't appear to be a complete loss of sensation, but rather a mild reduction. I'm also going to check your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Walking a few steps is no problem at all. Is that alright? I can walk faster, or slower, or… anything you need me to do. It feels perfectly normal to me, but I trust your assessment.
DOCTOR: Okay, your gait appears normal. No noticeable limping or instability. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the physical exam – normal reflexes and strength, intact sensation generally but decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of your left lower leg – it’s possible you have some mild nerve compression. This could be caused by a number of things, including compression of the peroneal nerve at the knee, or potentially something higher up. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, though. I’d like to order an MRI of your left leg to visualize the nerves and surrounding tissues. This will help me determine the cause of the nerve compression and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds sensible. Yes, that sounds perfectly good. If that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed. Will you be scheduling that here at the clinic? I imagine it will take some time to arrange. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of a tight schedule with work.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can schedule the MRI here at the clinic. It usually takes a few business days to get an appointment, and I’ll have my assistant reach out to you with the details as soon as it’s scheduled. We'll need to get some insurance pre-authorization as well. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms – prolonged standing, sitting with your legs crossed – and if you experience any worsening of the numbness, weakness, or pain, please contact the clinic immediately. We’ll discuss the results of the MRI when they come back, and develop a treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. It’s reassuring to have a direction to go in, and a potential explanation. I appreciate your time, Doctor Auelua. And thank you for being so patient and thorough. I understand these things take time. I’ll await a call from your assistant regarding the MRI. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, nothing else at this time. Just await a call from my assistant to schedule the MRI. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms before then, don't hesitate to call. It was a pleasure meeting you, Tarin, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Please have a good day. .
