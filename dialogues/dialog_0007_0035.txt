DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Hernandez. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, see? They just won’t go away. Been going on for… oh, goodness, a few days now, I’d say. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the oddest times.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of hiccups. That can be annoying, definitely. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Annoying is putting it mildly! They’re just… regular hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk in your chest, then you gulp air? Nothing fancy. They don't hurt, thankfully. Just… persistent. I tried holding my breath, like my mother always told me, and drinking water upside down, but neither seems to be doing the trick this time.
DOCTOR: Right, regular hiccups. And you've already tried the usual tricks – holding your breath and the water thing. Good to know. Are they happening more frequently now than when they first started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Yes, I think they are. When they first started a few days ago, it was just a hiccup here or there. Maybe one or two a day. Now… now it feels like every few minutes, especially when I'm trying to relax. I was watching my favourite show last night and nearly missed half of it! It’s quite disruptive, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing in frequency, and happening more when you're relaxing. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, besides relaxing?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… let me think. Now, this might sound silly, but sometimes when I eat something really sweet, they’ll start up. Not always, mind you, but often enough that I’ve noticed it. And… oh, and when I get excited, talking with my grandchildren, for instance. That usually does it too. Little things, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sweet foods and excitement seem to be associated with them. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… No, not really. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing, nothing like that. Just the hiccups themselves. Sometimes, if they go on for too long, my chest feels a little… tight, I suppose, from all the involuntary gulping. But that goes away as soon as the hiccups stop. I feel perfectly alright otherwise, thank you. Good energy, still tending my garden… everything’s normal, except for these pesky hiccups.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms, just the chest tightness from the hiccups themselves. And you're still feeling generally well otherwise. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in ‘87, I think it was. And I’ve always had a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a little pill every morning, that does the trick. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No major illnesses, no serious injuries. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in ‘87 and well-controlled high blood pressure. Good to know. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see if I can remember the name… Here it is. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, probably ten years now. It’s worked wonders, keeps everything nice and stable. And I always take it with my breakfast, same time every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And you take it regularly with breakfast. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty good with allergies. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I eat all sorts of things, too, don’t shy away from anything! Though, I do prefer Fijian cooking, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life, and very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with a special dinner once or twice a year, that’s all. Not a regular thing at all. I prefer a nice cup of herbal tea, thank you very much. Much healthier, you see!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and very minimal alcohol consumption. Good. And finally, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, very healthy woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart, I think it was. But he lived a good long life, too. As for my siblings… my sister had some arthritis in her later years, but nothing major. And my brother… he was always very healthy, active right up until the end. Overall, a pretty healthy family, all things considered. No history of any serious illnesses, like cancer or anything like that. We were all blessed, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy family history. That's good to know. Alright, Mirriam, thank you for all that information. It's very helpful. Now, let me just do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear there. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No tenderness, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I have a bit of a tummy, naturally, but it doesn't hurt. I enjoy my food a bit too much, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, soft abdomen, some fullness as expected. Pulse is good and regular. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Eyes look good, throat is clear. Everything seems normal physically. So, everything looks remarkably normal, Mirriam. Given your history of persistent hiccups, well-controlled blood pressure, and no other symptoms, and the fact that you've tried the usual remedies, it's likely a benign case of idiopathic hiccups. However, because they've been going on for a few days and are increasing in frequency, I want to rule out a few other possibilities.
PATIENT: Idiopathic hiccups? That sounds… complicated. So, it's not anything serious? Just… hiccups? But what could be causing them if it’s not anything in particular? And what possibilities are you thinking of ruling out, Doctor? I do appreciate you being thorough, of course. It’s just… I'd like to know what we're looking at.
DOCTOR: Idiopathic just means we don’t know the exact cause yet, and that's very common with hiccups. Most of the time, they resolve on their own. But because they are persistent, and you are 86, it's good to be cautious. We want to rule out anything that could be irritating the phrenic nerve, which controls your diaphragm. Sometimes, things like certain medications, acid reflux, or, rarely, something more serious like a problem with your lungs or heart can cause prolonged hiccups. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your electrolytes and kidney function, just to be sure. And I’m going to order a chest X-ray, just to get a look at your lungs and heart. It’s a precaution, Mirriam, I don’t think it's anything serious, but we want to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a chest X-ray… yes, that's a good idea. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as my mother always said. Electrolytes and kidney function… is that to check if my blood pressure medication is affecting things? And the X-ray will show if there’s anything going on with my lungs or heart? It’s just a bit worrying, you know, having hiccups that won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The blood tests will check your electrolyte levels, which can sometimes be affected by blood pressure medications, and also rule out any kidney issues. And the chest X-ray will give us a clear picture of your lungs and heart to make sure everything is functioning as it should. It's a routine procedure, Mirriam, and shouldn't cause you any discomfort. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a medication called Baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with hiccups. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. And I want you to keep a diary of your hiccups – when they occur, what you were doing, and if anything seems to trigger them. That will help us get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Baclofen… a muscle relaxant… that makes sense. And keeping a diary… yes, I can do that. I've always been a good record-keeper. When they occur, what I was doing, any triggers… yes, I can manage that. So, you don’t think it's anything serious, then? Just… persistent hiccups that we need to investigate?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Given your overall health and the results of my physical exam, I don’t think it's anything serious. However, it’s always best to be thorough and rule out any potential causes, especially given your age. The blood tests, X-ray, and Baclofen are just precautions. I’ll write you a prescription for the Baclofen, and I’ll send you to the lab for the blood tests and schedule the chest X-ray. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Blood tests, X-ray, Baclofen, diary… I think I’ve got it. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me and for being so thorough. It's a relief to know you’re taking this seriously. I’ll keep a careful diary, and I’ll let your office know as soon as I have the results of the tests. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. That's what I'm here for. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Get well soon, and please remember to take it easy. Here's the prescription and the lab order. The receptionist will schedule your X-ray before you leave.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will, thank you. I appreciate everything. Take care, Doctor Hernandez.
