DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… Oh, yes. It's this feeling sick to my stomach, mostly. And I just don't seem to get hungry anymore, even when I know I should be. It's been going on… a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, though. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's perfectly normal for things to be a little unclear sometimes. So, this feeling sick to your stomach and loss of appetite… can you tell me a little more about the nausea?
PATIENT: It’s not… terrible, exactly. Not like throwing up all the time or anything. It's more like… a queasy feeling. Just kind of unsettled. It comes and goes, mostly after I eat… but sometimes even before, if I think about food too much. It just doesn’t feel right, you know? And it makes me not want to eat, which… well, that's probably not helping things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a queasy feeling, comes and goes, sometimes before or after eating, and makes you feel less hungry. Is it worse with certain foods, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think so… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It seems to happen with most things. Maybe… maybe rich foods bother it a little more? But honestly, Doctor, I’ve been eating a lot of soup lately, just because it’s easy, and it still bothers me sometimes. It really doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense. I used to be able to eat just about anything!
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these things, even if it doesn’t make perfect sense. It helps us figure things out. So, mostly it’s just this queasy feeling, regardless of what you eat. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now that you mention it… I have been feeling more tired than usual. Just… worn out. And I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually stepped on a scale in ages. It’s probably nothing, though. Just getting older, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the tiredness and weight loss, Raymonde. Those are important things to note, and it's good we're talking about them. It may not be “just getting older.” Now, aside from the stomach upset, tiredness, and weight loss, have you been experiencing any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Well… yes, actually. They’re… different. Not regular, like they used to be. Sometimes… sometimes I have trouble going at all. And when I do… well, it’s not like it used to be, either. I didn't want to mention it, it’s a bit embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Raymonde, there’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and it's important to share everything so I can get a full picture of what’s going on. So, changes in bowel movements—irregularity, difficulty going, and a change in consistency. Have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, not that I’ve seen. I try not to look too closely, if I’m honest. It’s not a pleasant thought, you know? But… no, I don't think so. I haven't noticed anything like that. It's just… everything feels off, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. Now, let’s go over some other things, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. And I haven’t been having night sweats, thankfully. I do get a little warm sometimes, just from being under the blankets, but nothing unusual. Mostly just tired. And that queasy feeling. I keep hoping it'll just go away on its own, but it hasn't so far.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Well… my doctor, Dr. Miller, he passed away a few years back, and I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly since then. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure, maybe? He put me on some pills for it, but… I can't rightly recall the name of them. And… I was diagnosed with… with cancer, a few years ago now. Breast cancer, it was. I had surgery and… and treatment. They said I was in remission, but… I haven’t been back to check on it lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, thank you for sharing that. High blood pressure, and a history of breast cancer in remission. That’s very important information. Do you remember roughly when you were diagnosed with the breast cancer, and what type of treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it was… hmm… maybe five or six years ago now? It feels like a lifetime ago. I had surgery, of course. They removed… a lump. And then… then I had chemotherapy. Several rounds of it. It made me very sick, I remember that. And… and radiation. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Everything’s a bit hazy. I just remember being tired all the time and hoping it would all be over soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately five or six years ago, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation for breast cancer. It sounds like you went through a lot. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than what you may have taken for blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. No, not really. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a while back, I think Dr. Miller said it was okay. I take a little something for my arthritis now and then, when it flares up, but that's just over-the-counter stuff. Nothing regular. And… I take a vitamin D supplement, sometimes. Just when I remember, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional over-the-counter medication for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement sometimes. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in ages, and I think I’ve outgrown it. But other than that… no, nothing comes to mind. I eat most things, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… Well, my mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older. And my grandmother, on my father’s side… she had diabetes, I think. And… There was cancer in the family, too. My aunt, on my mother’s side, had it. Lung cancer, I believe. But other than that… it's hard to say. My family wasn't really the type to talk about such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart trouble, diabetes, and lung cancer in the family. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, bless his heart, he smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. And he eventually quit, thank goodness. We both tried to live a healthy life, as much as we could.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, sometimes. I might have a glass of wine with dinner, now and then. Or a little sherry. But nothing regular. I don't really care for it much, to be honest. It's more of a social thing, when I’m visiting with friends. But I haven't been out much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. Now, do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Oh yes! I have two cats, Marmalade and Shadow. They're both rescues. Marmalade is a big orange tabby, very friendly. And Shadow is a little black one, a bit shy. They keep me company, you know? I spend a lot of time with them. They’re very good company. And I used to train animals, too, you know. Dogs, mostly. It was a good life.
DOCTOR: That's lovely. Animals are wonderful companions. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your body, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Are you experiencing any unintentional weight loss, other than what you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Oh… well, yes, actually. I haven’t been weighing myself, like I said, but my clothes feel a bit looser, and I think I’ve lost a little weight around my waist. Not a lot, but noticeable. It’s happened gradually, over the last few months, I reckon. It’s just… it seems like everything’s shrinking these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual weight loss. And you've mentioned tiredness. Would you describe that as fatigue - a persistent feeling of exhaustion that isn’t relieved by rest?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that’s it exactly. It’s not just being a little sleepy, you know? It’s… like I’m carrying a heavy weight all the time. Even when I’ve slept a full night, I wake up feeling drained. It’s… hard to explain. It's just a constant weariness, that doesn’t go away. It makes it hard to do things, even simple things.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent fatigue, not relieved by rest. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My bones aren't what they used to be. And… I get a little nervous around doctors, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. And I understand your nervousness. We’ll take it slowly. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart and lungs sound good, but a little quiet. Your abdomen is soft, a little tender in the lower areas, and I see a scar from your surgery. Everything seems okay so far, but the tenderness and weight loss are concerning. Do you experience any pain with urination?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Not all the time, but sometimes when I go to the bathroom, it stings a bit. And I have to go more often, too. It’s very annoying. I just thought it was my age, you know? Old age and a weak bladder. But… it’s been happening for a while now. And… The color seems a bit darker sometimes, too. I didn't want to mention it, but… it's been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Raymonde. It’s good you told me. The pain with urination, increased frequency, and darker urine color are important things to investigate. Given your history of cancer, fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal tenderness, I would like to order some tests. First, a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection. A metabolic panel to evaluate kidney and liver function. And a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. I would also like to order a chest X-ray to ensure there is no recurrence of cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, let’s do the tests. I just hope they don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. We'll get these tests ordered right away. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Given your symptoms, and especially the tenderness and changes with urination, I'm going to recommend a referral to a urologist. They specialize in problems with the urinary system and can provide a more thorough evaluation. I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication to help ease any discomfort with urination. It's a mild analgesic, and hopefully will provide some relief. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: A urologist… yes, that sounds good. If you think it’s best. And a medicine for the pain… oh, that would be wonderful. I appreciate you thinking of that, Doctor. It’s just… it's been making it hard to sleep, you know? So yes, a urologist and some medicine sounds like a very good plan. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we're doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. I will write the prescriptions and referral orders right now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw blood and collect a urine sample. And I'll give you some written instructions about the tests and medications. I want you to know that we're going to work through this together. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. I’ll review the test results as soon as they’re available and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for listening to me. And for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. You’ve been very kind. I'll just be glad when I can find out what’s going on. And hopefully get some rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I’m happy to help. Please get plenty of rest, and remember to drink plenty of fluids. The nurse will be in shortly. Take care now, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
PATIENT: .
