DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too. Look here, I ain't got all day. I come 'bout… well, lookin' in the mirror these days. It ain't a pretty sight, I tell ya. Things… droopin' and saggin'. Need fixin', that's what. Don't need a long story, just wanna know what can be done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your appearance. We can definitely discuss what options might be available. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me specifically what areas you’re noticing these changes in?
PATIENT: Changes? Changes everywhere! You young people don’t understand. It's the neck, mostly. Plenty of skin there now that wasn't before. And... under the chin. Like a pouch. A proper pouch. And the arms... flabby, just flabby. Is that clear enough for ya? I don't wanna point out every little thing. Just fix the sag, that's all.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Mr. Trendler. You're noticing excess skin and some looseness in the neck, under the chin, and on your arms. That's a common concern as we age, and there are several things we can consider. Before we talk about potential treatments, I'd like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Not really. Stay pretty much the same for years now. Maybe a little less, a little more, depends on the week. But I eat proper, ya know? Not one o' them fast food fellas. Always been lean, even when I was drivin' pile. Just… the skin ain't keepin' up, that's the problem. It's like an old tent, saggin' in places. You followin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am following, Mr. Trendler. So, relatively stable weight for years, and you maintain a healthy diet. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your skin, like dryness, itching, or any areas of discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No, nothin' like pain. Just… looks. It's a bother lookin' at it, that's all. Skin's always been a bit dry, I suppose. Especially in the winter. Used a bit o' lotion now and then. But that don't fix the saggin', does it? Look, are we gonna talk about fixin' this or just talkin' 'bout lotion all day? I got things to do, ya know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I apologize if it feels like I’m taking too much time with questions. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. We will discuss options for addressing the sagging skin. Before we get to that, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of the skin's elasticity and overall condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You wanna poke and prod at me now? Hmph. Fine, get it over with. But don't be takin' all day, alright? And be gentle, I ain't made o' steel no more, ya know? Just get on with it, I suppose. But quick now. I got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to take a look at your neck and under your chin. Then I'll lightly palpate the skin to assess its texture and elasticity. I’ll also examine your arms briefly. Alright. I'm noting some moderate skin laxity in the neck and under the chin, as you described, along with some mild wrinkles. The skin on your arms also shows some looseness. The skin feels relatively normal in terms of texture, though it does have a decreased elasticity. It doesn't appear to be any areas of concern like discoloration or unusual growths.
PATIENT: Decreased elasticity? You tellin' me what I already know? I ain't 20 no more, doc! Look, what can you do about it? Is there some kinda cream? Some kinda machine? Or are you gonna tell me I just gotta live with lookin' like a prune? I ain't got time for a long list o' options, just tell me what's gonna make the biggest difference, and how much it's gonna cost. Straight talk, alright? None o' this fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for straight talk, Mr. Trendler. There are several options we could consider. Creams can help with hydration and a little bit of tightening, but they won’t make a significant difference in skin laxity. The most effective options for addressing the sagging skin are procedures. We could discuss a neck lift , which involves tightening the muscles and removing excess skin in the neck area. Another option is radiofrequency skin tightening, which uses energy to stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity. For the arms, we could consider an arm lift to remove excess skin and fat. The cost varies depending on the procedure and the extent of the work needed. A neck lift typically ranges from $8,000 to $15,000, radiofrequency skin tightening is around $1,500 to $3,000 per treatment session , and an arm lift ranges from $6,000 to $12,000. These are just estimates, and a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon would be needed to provide a more accurate quote. Would you be interested in me providing you with a referral to a qualified surgeon?
PATIENT: $8,000?! For a neck?! You gotta be kiddin' me! Radiofrequency sounds like somethin' outta a science fiction movie. I ain't payin' no $8,000 for a neck. And I definitely ain't lettin' nobody cut on me for that kinda money. Look, I think I'm done here. I was hopin' for a simple fix, maybe a good cream or somethin'. But this… this is just too much. I appreciate your time, doc, but I think I'll just have to live with it. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Trendler. Those are significant financial and personal decisions, and it’s important to feel comfortable with any treatment you choose. If you change your mind about exploring further options, or if you'd like recommendations for high-quality skincare products that may offer some improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure meeting you today. I wish you all the best. .
