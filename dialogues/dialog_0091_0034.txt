DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor… Delacour, right? I just… moved here. I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It’s a new area for me, and someone said I should come to a healthcare place. I have Medicare, if that matters. I don't really remember what they told me to do, exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bonck, “Delacour” is correct. It’s perfectly understandable to seek a primary care physician when you’ve relocated, and excellent that you have Medicare coverage. We can certainly get you established here. I see you’re 21 years old. And you mentioned you recently moved to the area… and that you are Haida?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Twenty-one… feels like a long time ago sometimes, haha. And yeah, Haida. From… well, it's a little hard to explain where from exactly. It's a place… up north? I'm not super good at remembering details, sorry. It's a small community, though. And I'm married, if that needs to be on something.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly alright if details are difficult to recall. Establishing a medical history is a process, and we'll take our time. Knowing you’re married is helpful information. To get started, could you tell me about any significant medical issues you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Um… significant? Wow. That’s a big word. I… I don't really know about significant. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, I think. Maybe since I was a kid? I remember getting shots, but… that’s about it. I don’t think I've had anything bad happen, not that I remember. I mean, the usual colds, maybe? Nothing serious. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bonck. It’s quite common for people to not have a regular doctor, and it’s very helpful to know you haven’t experienced any major medical issues that you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I… really don’t remember being in a hospital. Surgeries… definitely not. I mean, I’ve been to the emergency room once, maybe? When I was little? I fell off my bike, and I think I scraped my knee really bad. But it wasn’t… a big deal. Just a bandage, I think. Does that count? It feels like it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: No, a scraped knee doesn’t count as a surgery or hospitalization, Ms. Bonck. It’s good to know you haven’t had either of those. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family. Um… That’s a tricky one. I don’t… I didn’t really grow up with a lot of family. Not close, anyway. I know my mom… she had some problems with… I don’t know, feeling tired a lot? And my grandpa, on her side, he had something with his heart, maybe? But I don’t know the details, and I wasn’t super close to either of them. Sorry. I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Bonck. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have detailed information about your family’s medical history. Many people find themselves in the same situation. Knowing your mother experienced fatigue and that your grandfather had a heart condition is a good starting point, even without specific diagnoses. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I mean, I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, that I know of. I like cats, and I haven’t sneezed or anything. I eat lots of different foods. Maybe… I get a little itchy sometimes if I’m in a lot of dust? But that’s probably just… dust. Is that an allergy? I honestly don’t know. I’m really bad at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Bonck. It sounds like you likely don't have any significant allergies. A mild reaction to dust wouldn't typically be considered a major allergy. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take… Tylenol, I think? Or Advil? One of those. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Vitamins… maybe sometimes, if someone gives them to me? But I don't keep track of it. I think my husband gets some, but I don't take them. He’s pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you occasionally take Tylenol or Advil for headaches, and your husband takes vitamins. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Bonck, I'd like to ask a few questions about your current health status. Are you experiencing any symptoms at the moment – anything that's bothering you, no matter how minor it seems?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I feel okay, I think. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but… I think everyone is tired, right? And my back sometimes aches a little, but I think that’s from… sitting too much? I work with… machines all day. It’s a lot of bending and… stuff. Nothing really bad. Just normal, I think. I don't know if that answers your question. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bonck. Fatigue and occasional back pain are common, and it's helpful to know you're not experiencing any acute or severe symptoms. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about different parts of your body, just to rule things out. This is called a review of systems. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about things like your heart, lungs, digestive system, and so on?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Okay, sure. That sounds… thorough? I guess. I don’t know much about hearts or lungs or… digestive systems. I just know I eat food and… things come out the other end. Is that good enough? Haha. Sorry, I’m not very technical. But yeah, you can ask. Just… go slow? I might need you to explain things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. We'll take it very slowly, and I'll explain anything that's unclear. There’s no need to apologize at all. Let's start with your heart. Have you noticed any palpitations, fluttering in your chest, or unusual shortness of breath, even with normal activity?
PATIENT: Palpitations… is that like, when your heart beats fast? Um… no, not really. I think my heart beats normally. Sometimes it beats faster if I’m… scared, or if I run. But that feels normal, right? I haven't felt any fluttering, and I can breathe okay. I mean, I get tired sometimes, like I said, but that’s not… my heart, I don’t think. I just… get winded easily sometimes. Does that make sense? I'm not a very active person.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Bonck. It's normal for your heart rate to increase with exertion or stress. And feeling winded easily is common if you aren't very active. Okay, let’s move on to your lungs. Have you experienced any cough, wheezing, or chest pain, especially with breathing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t coughed much. Sometimes I get a little tickle in my throat, but that’s usually just from dust, I think. No wheezing. And no chest pain. My chest feels okay. I mean, sometimes it’s a little sore if I’ve been bending over machines all day, but that’s… muscle pain, I think. Not breathing pain. Is that a thing? I don’t know. I'm probably not explaining this very well. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Ms. Bonck. It’s very helpful to know you haven’t experienced any cough, wheezing, or chest pain. We're just ruling things out, and you're doing a great job. Now, let’s talk about your digestive system. Have you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a personal question. Sorry. Um… everything’s pretty normal, I think. I mean, I go to the bathroom when I need to. Sometimes I’m a little constipated, but that’s probably just because I don’t drink enough water. And no… no blood. Definitely not. I'm not very good at talking about this stuff. I just wanted to get set up as a new patient, and now we’re talking about… everything. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It is normal, Ms. Bonck. It’s important for me to gather a complete medical history, and that includes asking about all parts of your body. And you're doing very well. I apologize if the questions are uncomfortable. Okay, we'll move on to a different topic then. Are you experiencing any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. I don't sleep super well. Not like, insomnia or anything. But I toss and turn a lot. And I wake up feeling tired sometimes, even if I’ve slept for eight hours. I think it's just because I’m thinking about stuff. Work stuff. Or… just stuff. My husband says I talk in my sleep, but I don’t remember any of it. Does that count as a problem? I'm probably just a light sleeper. It's not a big deal, I don't think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Bonck. Occasional restlessness and waking up feeling tired, even after adequate sleep, can be common. And talking in your sleep isn't typically a cause for concern. It sounds like you may be experiencing some stress, which can definitely affect sleep quality. Are you experiencing any unexplained weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I've always been… this weight. I haven't lost or gained much lately. Maybe a pound or two, but that’s probably just from eating too much pizza. Or not enough exercise. I'm pretty stable, I think. I don't have much of an appetite, but I eat enough to keep going. I’m not worried about my weight. Is that a good answer? Sorry if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That is a very helpful answer, Ms. Bonck. It’s good to know you’ve experienced no significant weight changes. Now, Ms. Bonck, I'd like to ask about any pain you’re experiencing. Do you have any persistent pain anywhere in your body, even if it’s mild?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. My back hurts sometimes, like I said. Especially after work. I bend over a lot with the machines, and it gets stiff. And my shoulders are a little achy too. But it’s not… terrible pain. Just a dull ache. I usually just ignore it, or take some ibuprofen. And my knees sometimes hurt, but I think that’s just because I'm getting old. Haha. But it's not constant, if that makes sense. It comes and goes. Is that a real pain, or just… getting old pain?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Bonck. It sounds like you’re experiencing some musculoskeletal pain – pain in your muscles and bones – likely related to your work and possibly some age-related changes. It's perfectly valid to experience this, and it sounds like you’re managing it with ibuprofen. And finally, are you experiencing any skin changes, such as rashes, moles, or lesions?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. My skin is pretty normal. I get a little sunburned sometimes if I’m out in the sun too long, but that’s about it. I have a few freckles, but those have been there forever. And a little scar on my knee from when I fell off my bike when I was a kid. But no new rashes or moles or anything weird. I usually just wear sunscreen if I'm going to be outside. Is that good? Sorry if I'm rambling. I just want to get this over with. It's a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Bonck. You're doing a great job providing information. And it's good to know you haven't experienced any significant skin changes. Okay, that completes the review of systems. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, okay. I guess so. A physical exam sounds… okay. As long as it's not too… invasive? I'm a little nervous, but I guess it's okay. I just… I don’t really like doctors. But I need to get this over with, right? So yeah, go ahead. Just… be gentle? And tell me what you're doing, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. I understand your nervousness, and I will be as gentle as possible. I will explain everything I'm doing before I do it. It's a routine exam, and we'll take it at your pace. First, I’m going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… here. I hope my blood pressure isn’t too high. I get nervous at doctors, you know? Is that a thing? Does being nervous make it higher? I really don’t like this. But I want to get it over with. Just… hurry, please? No, that’s rude. Sorry. It’s just… I don’t like being touched. Especially by strangers. But you seem nice. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious at the doctor, Ms. Bonck, and yes, anxiety can temporarily raise your blood pressure. We’ll just take a few readings, and if it's elevated due to nerves, we can recheck it later. You're doing great. I’m just listening for the sounds now. Your blood pressure is 130/85. It's slightly elevated, but likely due to the stress of the exam. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Everything else looks good so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay… my heart is beating really fast, probably. I can feel it. Everything sounds… okay? I don’t know. I’m not a doctor, you know? Is my heart beating okay? And my lungs… they sound normal, right? They don’t sound… wheezy or anything? I get a little short of breath sometimes, but it’s probably just because I’m out of shape. Can you hear anything weird? Just tell me if something’s wrong, okay? I don’t want any surprises. This is all very… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Ms. Bonck, and I don't hear any murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, and I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds perfectly normal. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Um… okay. That’s… a little uncomfortable. I get bloated sometimes, but it’s probably just gas. No pain, though. Just… feels weird. I don’t usually like people touching my stomach. It’s just… personal. Is something wrong? You’re frowning. Are you finding something? Just tell me if something’s wrong, okay? Don’t beat around the bush. I just want to know. This is making me really anxious. Can we be done soon?
DOCTOR: I'm not frowning, Ms. Bonck, just concentrating. And no, I’m not finding anything concerning. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, which is good. It’s normal to feel a little anxious during a physical exam, and I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. I’m just completing a routine assessment. Now, I’m going to gently check your lymph nodes. These are small glands that can sometimes become swollen if there’s an infection. It doesn’t usually cause pain.
PATIENT: Okay… that feels… weird. I don’t think anything’s swollen. I haven’t been sick or anything. Just… normal. I get goosebumps easily, though. Are you finding something? You’re being really quiet. Just tell me if something’s wrong, okay? This is making me really nervous. Can we please be done soon? I just want to get this over with. I don't like being touched. I really, really don't. It feels like an invasion of privacy. Sorry. I’m probably being difficult. But I’m really anxious. Please just tell me if everything's okay.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Ms. Bonck. I understand your anxiety, and I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. I completely respect your boundaries, and we can absolutely proceed at your pace. I’ve completed the physical exam. Your lymph nodes are normal in size, and I didn’t find any abnormalities. Everything else looks good. Based on the physical exam and your medical history, everything appears to be normal. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and to get a more comprehensive picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions and ensure your overall health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. And as long as it doesn't hurt too much. I hate needles. But if it helps, then… yeah. Blood work sounds okay. Can you explain what you’re looking for? And where do I go to get it done? And how long will it take? I just want to know everything, okay? I’m a little anxious, as you know. And can we be done talking now? It's been a long exam. Thank you. For being gentle. And for explaining things. It means a lot. I just need to sit down for a minute. It was… a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. I completely understand your anxiety, and I'll explain everything in detail. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We’ll be checking a complete blood count to assess your overall health, including your red and white blood cell levels. We’ll also check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid function. These tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions and ensure your overall health. You can get the blood work done at the lab located across the hall. The nurse will give you a requisition form, and they’ll be able to schedule an appointment for you. It typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete the blood draw. The results will be available in 3-5 business days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Bonck?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you. For everything. You were really nice. And patient. I appreciate it. I just need to sit down for a minute and… breathe. Is it okay if I just… sit here for a little while? I just need a moment. Before I go get the blood work done. Thank you. Again. Really. It was… a lot. And I think I need a glass of water. But I’m okay. Just… a little overwhelmed. Thank you. That’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bonck. Please take all the time you need. I will have the nurse bring you a glass of water. Don’t hesitate to let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Please remember to schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you’ve had the blood work done so we can discuss the results. Have a good day, Ms. Bonck.
