DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, yeah? Something’s… leaking. Down there. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, really. Old age, I guess. Everything gets loose, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s not embarrassing at all, Jimmi. These things happen, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. "Leaking," as you put it, can have a number of causes, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand, can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When…? Oh, geez. You want me to remember when? I dunno! Sometimes… after I use the bathroom, maybe? Or… just when I’m sitting. It’s not like a whole lot, not like a flood or anything. Just… a little wet. Sometimes I notice it on my underpants. Is that… good to know or something? I don’t keep track of these things, you know. Everything just happens.
DOCTOR: It is good to know, Jimmi, don't worry. It helps me narrow down what might be going on. So it happens sometimes after you urinate, and other times just when you're sitting?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. After I pee, and… just sitting. Especially if I've been sitting a long time. Like watching my stories on TV. Or… visiting with friends. It’s not painful or anything, thankfully. Just… annoying. And kinda smelly, I guess. Though I try to keep things clean, you know? Old lady problems. Everything falls apart.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, which is good. And you’re noticing a smell sometimes. I understand. It sounds like we're dealing with something called urinary incontinence - that just means unintentional leakage of urine. There are different types of incontinence, and figuring out which type it is will help us decide the best course of action. To help me understand a bit more, have you noticed any changes in your bladder habits lately?
PATIENT: Bladder habits…? What do you mean? Like… do I go a lot? I think so. I go when I need to go. Old age, you know. Everything’s weaker. I try not to hold it too long, 'cause that makes it worse. And… sometimes I get the urge real sudden, and gotta go right now. Like can’t wait, gotta run to the bathroom. Does that count? I don't pay attention to how often, or anything like that. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Sudden urges and needing to go frequently. It sounds like you might be experiencing what we call urge incontinence, along with possibly stress incontinence—leakage when you put pressure on your bladder, like when you cough or laugh. Now, have you had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Geez, I’ve lived a long time. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… uh… I think I had something on my tummy once. A long time ago. When I was having babies. But I don't remember much about it. All blurry now. Lots of doctors and… pain. I don’t like doctors, really. Everything just happened so fast back then. And I was young and… scared, I guess. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter, Jimmi. Surgeries can sometimes affect bladder control. It’s okay if you don’t remember the details; we can look through your records if you’d like. Let me ask you this: have you ever had any problems with urinary tract infections, or UTIs?
PATIENT: UTIs…? Oh, those! Yeah, I think so. A few times. Burning when I pee, and gotta go all the time, even when there’s nothing there. And… a fever, maybe? Hard to remember now. My daughter, she always tells me to drink cranberry juice when I feel that way. Is that good? She’s a smart girl, that one. Always looking things up on the internet. Everything aches when you get old, you know. Hard to tell what’s what.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had symptoms of UTIs before, and your daughter recommends cranberry juice. That’s good to know. Cranberry juice can sometimes help prevent UTIs, but it's not always effective. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, geez, let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And something for my arthritis. It helps with the aching. And sometimes I take something for my stomach, when it’s bothering me. But that’s only when I need it. All these pills, you know? I don't even know what they do half the time. My daughter keeps track of them, mostly. She's good with that stuff. I just swallow them when she tells me to. Everything feels fuzzy now, you know? Old age.
DOCTOR: Okay. So you’re taking medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and something as needed for your stomach. It's good you have your daughter helping you keep track of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a basic check to rule out other causes and get a better understanding of what's going on. It won’t be anything too uncomfortable, just checking your abdomen and a quick neurological exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… You wanna poke and prod at me? I don’t really like being poked and prodded. Everything aches enough already, you know? But… if you think it's important… alright. I guess. Just… be gentle, okay? And don't take too long. Everything hurts these days. And tell me what you’re doing, so I don’t get scared. Old lady’s heart, you know. Everything gets easily spooked.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. It won't take long, I promise. Okay, Jimmi, I’m just feeling your abdomen. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little bit there… yeah, that tickles… no, it hurts. Just a little. Everything's kinda sore these days. Is that bad? Everything feels like it's… falling apart. It's probably just old age, right? Everything hurts when you get old. You don't gotta tell me that. I already know. And what are you doing now? You're poking my legs... Does that have something to do with the leaking? Tell me. I don't like surprises, you know. Everything just feels…weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. It's alright. Just feeling for tenderness, and checking your reflexes. The leg part is just to see if the nerves that control your bladder are working properly. The tenderness is common with age and could be contributing to your discomfort. Okay, all done. Everything seemed normal, Jimmi, but I do want to send a urine sample to the lab just to rule out an infection and check for other issues. We can do that right here in the clinic. Would you be able to provide a sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample…? Oh, geez. You want me to pee in a cup? Right now? That’s… embarrassing. But I guess I gotta, if you want it. Everything's embarrassing these days, really. Getting old ain't for sissies, you know. Just… tell me where to go, and… how much do you need? And… is there a lid on the cup? I don’t want to spill it everywhere. Everything just feels awkward. Oh, and is there a place to wash my hands after? Everything gets germy, you know. Old lady problems.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I completely understand. Yes, we have a private bathroom right down the hall. There's a lid on the cup, and plenty of soap and water for washing your hands afterwards. You just need to collect a small sample - about two to three ounces. I’ll give you instructions when we go. Don’t worry, it's very common, and we'll make sure you feel comfortable. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished.
PATIENT: Alright… I think I got enough. It wasn’t easy, everything’s kinda… slow these days. It's kinda… smelly, I hope that’s alright. Old lady problems, you know. Everything just… leaks. Here you go. Now, what happens next? You’re gonna poke and prod at that too? Everything just feels… vulnerable. Tell me it won't take too long. And tell me what you find, alright? I don't like being kept in the dark. Everything just… worries me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jimmi. And don’t worry, we won’t be poking and prodding at the sample itself! The lab will run some tests on it. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a combination of urge incontinence and stress incontinence, possibly exacerbated by a weak pelvic floor. It's very common with age and having children. We have a few options we can discuss. Pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, can help strengthen those muscles. We can also discuss bladder training techniques to help you regain control. And if those aren’t enough, there are other medical options available, like medication or, in some cases, more advanced procedures. But let’s start with the simpler things first. Would you be interested in learning more about pelvic floor exercises?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises…? You want me to… squeeze my… down there? Oh, geez. That sounds embarrassing. And kinda hard, everything's kinda loose, you know. I don't think I can even find those muscles anymore. But… I guess I can try, if you think it will help. Everything's worth a try, right? But… tell me how to do it, slowly. And don't laugh at me if I can't get it right. Everything just feels… old and broken. And will it hurt? Everything hurts these days, you know. Old lady problems. Everything aches. I hope it won't take too long. Everything just wears me out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble finding those muscles at first, especially if you haven't done them before. And I promise, I won't laugh. It's a very common issue, and I’ll guide you through it. And no, it shouldn’t hurt. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. Okay, so imagine you’re trying to stop yourself from urinating mid-stream. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that. It’s a gentle squeeze, not a full contraction. Hold that squeeze for a few seconds—start with three to five seconds—and then relax for the same amount of time. Repeat that ten to fifteen times, three times a day. You can do these exercises anywhere—sitting, standing, or lying down. It might help to practice when you're alone so you can focus without feeling self-conscious. Let’s try a few together. Focus on squeezing those muscles… That’s it. Feel that gentle tightening?
PATIENT: Oh… I think so. It’s kinda… hard. Everything feels kinda… weak. Is that right? I don't think I’m doing it right. Everything's just kinda… flabby. And I think I’m squeezing my stomach muscles too. Is that bad? Everything just feels… awkward. I think I need to go to the bathroom now. Everything just… loosens up after I pee. And what if I’m still leaking after I do these exercises? Everything just feels… hopeless. Old lady problems. Everything just falls apart. I hope I can do this. Everything wears me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, that’s perfectly normal. It takes practice to isolate those pelvic floor muscles. You are likely squeezing your stomach muscles a bit, that's common at first. Try to relax your stomach and focus on squeezing only the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. It's a subtle movement. Don't worry about not getting it perfect right away. It takes time and consistency. The important thing is to try. And if you're still leaking after a few weeks of consistent exercises, we can explore other options. There’s no shame in needing a little extra help. Let’s not worry about doing them perfectly right now. Just try to be aware of those muscles and practice a few times throughout the day. Before you go, I’m going to give you a handout with more detailed instructions and a few helpful tips. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a month from now, so we can check your progress and discuss how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright… a handout, huh? And another appointment… Everything takes so long. But… I guess I gotta try. Everything's worth a try, right? But… what if it doesn’t work? Everything just feels… old and broken. I hope it doesn’t take too long to see results. Everything wears me out. Okay… give me the handout. And schedule the appointment for whenever you’re free. I don’t really have a schedule anymore. Everything just… comes and goes. Just… don’t make it too soon. Everything wears me out. And thank you… I guess. Everything just feels… overwhelming. Old lady problems. Everything just aches.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. And I understand how overwhelming this can be. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for November 2nd, so we have plenty of time to see how things go. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help. Here’s the handout. It explains the exercises in more detail, and it also has a section on bladder training. And please, don’t push yourself too hard. Small steps are perfectly fine. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: November 2nd… Okay. I’ll try to remember. Everything’s so blurry these days. No… I don’t think so. Everything just… feels too overwhelming right now. I just wanna go home and rest. Everything aches. I guess… thank you again. You were… nice. Everything just feels a little less scary now. But… I still worry. Everything falls apart, you know. Okay… I guess I’ll see you in November. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
