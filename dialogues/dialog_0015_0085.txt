DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… this patch of skin. It’s just… off. Not right. I noticed it a few weeks back, and it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s on my left forearm, and it’s just… discolored. Honestly, it’s rather unsightly.
DOCTOR: Discolored, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not a pleasant sort of color, really. It’s not a rash, not bumpy or itchy, just… a flat patch that's a sort of… greyish-brown. And it’s not like a sunspot, I assure you. I’m very careful with the sun. My grandmother always said… well, never mind what my grandmother said. It’s just… not a normal skin tone. It's very noticeable, especially when I’m dressed for work.
DOCTOR: And how large would you estimate this patch to be, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It’s… roughly the size of a silver dollar, perhaps a little larger. Maybe… two inches across? It's not huge, thankfully. But it is quite distinct. You know, I really don’t like things being… out of place. It’s a very unsettling color, honestly. I've been trying to cover it with long sleeves, but it's August, Doctor. Long sleeves aren’t exactly practical.
DOCTOR: And has this patch changed in size or shape at all since you first noticed it a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I think it might be… slightly larger. Very slight, though. It's hard to say for certain. I mostly just notice it because it’s… there, you know? It doesn’t really feel different. No itching, no pain, no… scaling. Just… a persistent discoloration. I really do wish I knew what caused it. I haven’t been traveling, haven’t used any new lotions… frankly, I’m quite meticulous about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Bartock, I’d like to take a look at it myself. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve so I can examine your forearm?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. It’s just… try not to make a face, will you? I know it’s not very… aesthetically pleasing. It really is quite bothersome. There you are. Be careful, it’s a bit sensitive, not from pain, just… awareness, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. Roughly two inches in diameter, flat, irregular borders. Color is… a mottled grey-brown, as you described. No palpable induration or warmth. No scaling or crusting. Lymph nodes in the axilla are not enlarged on palpation. It is unusual, Ms. Bartock. Have you had any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Not that I've noticed. I'm quite healthy, generally. I eat a balanced diet, I get plenty of sleep, I don’t smoke, barely drink… honestly, Doctor, I’m very responsible with my health. My husband, Dimitri, always says I fuss over everything. He jokes that I’ll live to be a hundred. No new medications, no allergies… perhaps it’s just… a quirk? I do have a rather fair complexion, you know. Always have. But I’m meticulous about sunscreen. Really, I am. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the persistent nature of this discoloration and your concern, I'd like to take a small skin sample - a biopsy - to get a definitive diagnosis. It’s a very quick procedure, we'll numb the area beforehand, and it will help us rule out anything serious. It’s standard procedure for anything unusual like this. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. That sounds… rather invasive, doesn't it? Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t it just be… a pigmentation issue? Or some sort of… harmless discoloration? I really do dislike needles, Doctor. And I worry about scarring. I'm quite particular about my appearance, you understand. Perhaps we could try… a cream? Or some sort of topical treatment first? Before resorting to… cutting into my skin?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while I understand your apprehension, a cream or topical treatment wouldn't provide a definitive diagnosis. We need to know what we are dealing with before we can determine the best course of action. Trying a treatment without knowing the cause could potentially delay proper care if it is something more serious. The biopsy is a small procedure, a local anesthetic will completely numb the area, and the scarring will be minimal - often barely noticeable. It's the most responsible approach in this situation. However, if you are truly opposed, we can discuss a referral to a dermatologist for a second opinion. But I strongly advise against simply hoping it goes away on its own. Are you familiar with the risks of melanoma?
PATIENT: Melanoma? Well, I’ve heard of it, of course. Dreadful thing. But I'm very careful about sun exposure! I always wear a hat, and I use a high SPF sunscreen. Really, I do. My mother always drilled it into me. So, you’re saying this could be… something like that? Oh dear. I suppose if it’s to rule that out… Alright, very well. A biopsy, then. But please be gentle. And do make sure the anesthetic works properly. I really dislike needles. And I expect a very neat stitch, if one is required. Absolutely no unsightly scars. Dimitri will be very cross if I come home looking… damaged.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. I assure you, we’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll personally administer the anesthetic to ensure proper numbing. And I’ll make every effort to minimize scarring – we use a fine suture technique. We'll send the sample to pathology, and we should have results within a week or so. In the meantime, avoid direct sun exposure to that area, and let me know if you experience any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, or increasing pain. Now, let me prepare the area. Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics – lidocaine, for example?
PATIENT: Lidocaine… I don’t think so. Dimitri handles all the medical things, honestly. I faint at the sight of blood. Let me think… no, I don’t recall any reaction to it before, but I haven’t had much… experience with it. Though, my grandmother… she once had a reaction to a bee sting, but that wasn’t lidocaine, was it? Oh dear, this is all very stressful. Just… please be quick, Doctor. And gentle, as you promised. I have a luncheon with the ladies tomorrow, and I certainly don’t want to arrive looking… distressed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Just relax. I'll explain each step as I go. And it will be over before you know it. Now, let's clean the area with some antiseptic. This will sting a little. Just breathe deeply... Dimitri will be pleased we're being thorough. Would you prefer I not mention the word "biopsy" to him?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely! Dimitri worries terribly about everything. He'd be beside himself. Just tell him it was… a little skin irregularity we needed to… investigate further. A preventative measure, perhaps? He’s very susceptible to alarm, you see. Honestly, he'd probably want me to stay in bed for a week. Just… keep it vague, Doctor. And please, no mention of “cancer” or anything of that nature. He’d be utterly inconsolable. And do be careful with that needle. Honestly, the thought of it… it’s quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. I will be as discreet as possible. Now, this will sting momentarily… Just a little pinch... Alright, it should be nicely numbed now. Can you feel any sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, no… I think not. It feels… sort of tingly, perhaps? But no pain. Definitely not painful. Though… is it supposed to feel that cold? It feels rather… chilly. And is that… a slight burning sensation? Honestly, Doctor, are you certain the anesthetic is working properly? I really do dislike needles, and I'm very sensitive to… things. Perhaps we should try a little more? Dimitri always says I have a low pain threshold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. You're right, there is some mild stinging. Let me administer just a little more anesthetic. It’s likely a superficial nerve is still responding. There… now, just give it another minute. We want to ensure complete numbing before we proceed. Just relax, and breathe deeply. Dimitri would want you to be comfortable, wouldn't he?
PATIENT: Yes, he would. Dimitri always insists on the best possible care. He’s very… protective. Hmm. It is… slightly better now. The tingling seems to have subsided. Though, there’s still a faint… burning sensation. It’s not painful, exactly, just… unsettling. Is it normal for it to feel… warm? Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to feel rather faint. Perhaps I should lie down? Dimitri will be furious if I faint. Absolutely furious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, you're right to tell me that. Lie back, please. Let me get you a cool compress. You're likely experiencing a vasovagal response – a common reaction to stress and anxiety. Just breathe deeply with me. In… and out… We’ll pause the procedure for now. I will inform the nurse, and we can reassess your comfort level in a few minutes. It's alright. We're going to take things slowly. Just focus on your breathing. Dimitri would want you to prioritize your well-being, wouldn’t he?
PATIENT: Yes, he would. Oh, thank you, Doctor. That… that is much better. The cool compress is lovely. I do apologize for all the fuss. I’m not usually like this. It's just… needles. And the thought of… everything. Perhaps it would be best to reschedule? I really do think I’m not up to it today. Dimitri always says I should listen to my body. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea would help? And a lie-down, of course. A long lie-down.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Bartock. You’re not causing any fuss at all. And yes, I think rescheduling is the best course of action. We can try again another day when you're feeling more relaxed. I'll inform the nurse, and we can arrange a follow-up appointment. Let's just focus on getting you comfortable for now. Would you like me to call Dimitri for you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not! He’d be beside himself with worry. He’d want to rush me to the hospital, and then I’d really feel dreadful. No, please don’t call Dimitri. I’ll… I’ll explain it to him later, when I’m feeling calmer. Perhaps over a nice cup of chamomile tea. Yes, that’s best. Chamomile tea. And a very long lie-down. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think I need a moment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. Take all the time you need. I’ll let the nurse know to keep the room quiet and to check on you periodically. And please, don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you're feeling any worse. Just focus on relaxing, and we’ll get this rescheduled for another day. .
