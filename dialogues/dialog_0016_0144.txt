DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Maskal, is it? Such a pretty name. Well, honestly? I just… thought I’d come in. My daughter kept telling me to get a check-up, but I feel perfectly fine. Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about, I suppose. It's not like anything hurts, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Preventative care is wonderful, even when you're feeling well. It's good of you to listen to your daughter. Sometimes things don’t feel wrong until they are more serious, and we want to catch anything early. Just to get a good picture of things, could you tell me a little more about why your daughter suggested a check-up?
PATIENT: Oh, she's a worrier, that one. Always has been. She says I'm getting “older” and need to make sure everything is still… working. Honestly, I don't remember what exactly she said. Something about… numbers? And blood? She reads a lot of things online, so goodness knows what she’s picked up now. It's all a bit much for me to keep track of, you know? I just let her schedule things. She means well, of course.
DOCTOR: Daughters are wonderful, but you’re right, they can worry! It sounds like she might be referring to routine blood work to check things like your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function - those are all important numbers to monitor as we get older. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. It's been so long. Let me think… I had something with my… gallbladder, years ago. They took it out, I think. And my husband, bless his soul, he always handled the doctor stuff. I just… went along. I really can’t remember much else. I’m sorry. Is this important? I just… don't have a good memory for these things. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Don’t worry about it at all. It's very common to forget details about past medical history, especially if it was a long time ago or someone else managed those details for you. We can look through your records, but it’s helpful to get as much information as you can recall. You mentioned gallbladder removal. Do you remember roughly when that surgery was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When was that? Hmm… let me see. My daughter, Emily, she was still in… high school, I think. No, maybe middle school? She had that awful phase with the… bright pink clothes. Yes! Definitely before she went to college. Oh, this is so hard. Was it… the 90s? Maybe early 2000s? I really don't know. Everything just blends together after a while, you know? It was… a long time ago. A very long time ago. I hope that helps?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Calvery, thank you. We can try to confirm the date in your records. And don’t worry, we’ll get there. Now, besides the gallbladder, have you had any other surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. No, I don't believe so. I broke my wrist once, a long time ago, when I was gardening. But that wasn’t a hospital stay, just a cast. And… oh! I had a bad flu a few years back, but that was just at home with lots of tea and rest. Nothing serious, really. My husband always said I was a tough old bird. He'd make me chicken soup and tell me to rest. I miss him. Honestly, I think that’s all. I really haven't been to the doctor much in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. And it's perfectly alright if you don't remember every detail. It's lovely that your husband took such good care of you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Well, I take something for my… arthritis. My hands get a bit stiff, you know? It's a little white pill. I think it’s… naproxen? Yes, I think that’s it. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago. Said it was fine now. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement. Emily makes me. She says I don't get enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. Just those few things. I’m pretty good about remembering those, thankfully. Small pills are easier to keep track of!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I don’t have any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. I can eat anything, thankfully. Emily always worries about that too, when we go to restaurants. She asks the waiter a million questions about ingredients. But I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That's good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Now that’s a tough one. My parents… well, they both passed away a long time ago. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. My father… he was a very strong man, always healthy. He never had much trouble with anything. My brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. But that was years ago. Honestly, I don’t know much about their medical history. They didn’t really talk about those things. It wasn’t something we did.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. It's common for family medical history to be limited. We can always explore this further if you think of anything. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, dear. What does that mean? Um… I live at home. With my cat, Winston. He's a fluffy Persian. I mostly stay home. I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. And I watch a lot of television. Old movies, mostly. I don’t really… do much, to be honest. I used to be very active, but it’s harder now. My hands aren’t what they used to be. And I don’t drive anymore. I get around with Emily’s help. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, that's exactly what I mean. That gives me a good sense of things. It sounds like you enjoy a peaceful life at home. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, never smoked a day in my life! My husband tried once, years ago, but he didn't like it. And I don't drink alcohol. Never have. It just doesn't appeal to me. I prefer a nice cup of tea. Earl Grey, usually. Or sometimes chamomile if I’m feeling a bit restless. No, just tea for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Calvery. So, to recap, you're feeling well overall, came in at your daughter’s suggestion for a check-up, have a history of gallbladder removal, take naproxen and vitamin D, and have no known allergies. You don't smoke or drink alcohol. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and joints. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not a fan of doctors, but if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just be gentle with my hands, alright? They get a bit sore. I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to pain, I’m afraid. But go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery, I’ll be very gentle. We'll take it slow. First, let's check your blood pressure. I take her blood pressure, listening carefully with the stethoscope. 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. I listen to her heart and lungs with the stethoscope, front and back. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good airflow bilaterally. Now, could you please extend your hands for me?
PATIENT: There they are. Be careful now, they get stiff easily. And there's a bit of swelling, especially in the knuckles. It's worse in the mornings. I try to use lotion, Emily buys me fancy lotion, but it only helps so much. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I gently flex and extend her fingers and wrists. I do notice some swelling and tenderness in several of your joints, particularly in your knuckles and wrists. The range of motion is slightly limited. I document my findings. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common condition in older adults. It’s caused by wear and tear on the joints over time. It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling. Does the pain radiate anywhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It mostly stays in my hands, but sometimes it goes up my wrists, into my forearms. And when it’s really bad, I feel it in my elbows. It’s not constant, just when I use my hands a lot. Like when I'm gardening, or trying to open a jar. That's when it really flares up. I usually just rest them, and it gets a bit better. But it's always there, a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. The radiating pain is also consistent with osteoarthritis. It sounds like your symptoms are managed with rest, which is good. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and test your strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you need to do. I always feel a bit silly doing those tests. I’m not very good at them, I’m afraid. But go ahead, please. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery, no pressure at all. We’re just gathering information. I gently test Ms. Calvery’s reflexes in her arms and legs, and assess her strength by asking her to squeeze my hands and push against my resistance. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Calvery, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it appears you have mild osteoarthritis in your hands, which is causing your pain and stiffness. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that can be monitored and addressed with lifestyle modifications.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Mild. That doesn't sound so bad. Lifestyle modifications? What does that mean? Do I have to eat rabbit food? And what about my hands? Is there anything I can do about the pain? It gets so frustrating when I can't open a jar, or button my coat. I just want to be able to do things without hurting.
DOCTOR: No, no rabbit food! Lifestyle modifications simply mean making small changes to your daily routine to improve your overall health. For your blood pressure, that includes things like eating a healthy diet – focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, reducing your salt intake, and getting regular exercise. Even a short walk each day can make a big difference. As for your hands, there are several things we can do to manage the pain. We can start with some simple measures like applying heat or cold packs to your hands, using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen when needed, and using assistive devices to help with everyday tasks. We can also consider a referral to a physical therapist, who can teach you exercises to strengthen your hands and improve your range of motion. In some cases, we might consider injections to help relieve pain and inflammation. But let's start with the simpler measures first and see how you respond. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… less scary than I thought. A little exercise, some heat, maybe a pill when needed. I can probably manage that. The physical therapist sounds good too, if it helps. I don’t want to become a burden on Emily, you know? So, no drastic changes? Just… taking care of myself a little better? That sounds… manageable. And what about my blood pressure? Is that something I need to worry about right away?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Calvery. No drastic changes. Small, manageable steps. And you are not a burden to Emily at all! It sounds like she cares about you very much and wants to help. As for your blood pressure, it's mildly elevated, but not at a level that requires immediate medication. We can monitor it for a few months with regular check-ups, and if it doesn’t come down with lifestyle modifications, we can discuss medication options at that time. I’m going to write you a prescription for a refill of your naproxen, and I’ll give you a referral to a physical therapist. I’ll also give you a handout with information on osteoarthritis and some simple exercises you can do at home. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how you’re doing and check your blood pressure. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfect. A follow-up in three months sounds reasonable. And the handout is a good idea, I always forget things. Thank you. You've been very kind and patient with me. I was worried it would be something terrible, but you've put my mind at ease. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the physical therapy? Should I wear special clothes? Or anything? I always worry about doing things wrong.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. As for the physical therapy, there’s no need to worry about special clothes. Just wear something comfortable that allows you to move freely. They’ll probably want you to start with some gentle exercises, so comfortable shoes are a good idea too. And most importantly, just be honest with the therapist about your pain levels and any limitations you have. They’ll tailor the exercises to your needs. I’ll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, dear. You've answered everything I've been worrying about. Thank you again for being so patient with an old woman who forgets everything! You've been a lifesaver. I think I'm ready to go. I just hope I can remember where I parked the car!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t worry about remembering where you parked – I’m sure you’ll find it. If you have any trouble, just ask the receptionist, and they’ll be happy to help. Here’s your prescription and the handout. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
