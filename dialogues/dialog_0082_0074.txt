DOCTOR: Good morning, Venna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’m here 'cause my blood pressure's been actin’ up, I guess. My regular doctor said I should get it checked out by someone else, and folks told me you were good. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s alright. I don’t like feelin’ poorly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright, Venna. We'll certainly take a look at that blood pressure for you. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. And thank you for the kind words. Now, when you say “actin’ up,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it ain’t nothin’ sudden, mind you. It's been buildin’ for a while. I get these headaches, mostly in the back of my neck, and I feel kinda dizzy sometimes. Not fallin’ over dizzy, just…lightheaded. And my husband – bless his soul, he’s been gone five years now – he used to say my face looked kinda puffy sometimes. I reckon that’s it, too. It just feels…off. I try to ignore it, but it keeps comin’ back.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches in the back of the neck, dizziness…lightheadedness, and your husband noticed some puffiness in your face. That gives us a good starting point. Has this been happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Seems worse when I’m stressed, or if I’ve had too much salt, I reckon. I do love my baking, and sometimes I get a little heavy-handed with the seasoning, you know? But even when I'm watchin' it, it still happens sometimes. It's just…unpredictable. It’s been goin’ on for maybe six months now, off and on. Not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of intermittent symptoms, worse with stress or salt intake. That’s helpful. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were at your previous doctor's office?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t. They just told me it was “high-ish” and I should see someone else. They didn’t give me numbers or anything. I’m not good with rememberin’ numbers anyway, bless my heart. It's been a long time since I paid much attention to those things. Is that bad? Should I have asked?
DOCTOR: No, not at all bad, Venna. It’s perfectly alright. Sometimes doctors don’t give all the details, and it’s easy to forget things in the moment. That's what we're here for. We’ll get a reading here today. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I had a bit of trouble with arthritis in my hands when I was younger, but it's mostly under control with some cream. And I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, but that hasn't bothered me since. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’ve always been a busybody, always movin’ and doin’ somethin’. Maybe that’s why!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. Arthritis and gallbladder removal. And staying active is excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my hands, like I said. And sometimes I take a little ibuprofen for the arthritis if it flares up somethin’ awful. That’s it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I don’t like feelin’ all muddled from 'em, you know? I’d rather just tough it out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, just topical cream and occasional ibuprofen. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me, bless my heart. Never had a reaction to nothin'. I spend a lot of time outside with my gardenin’, too, and the pollen doesn’t bother me none. My husband, now he was allergic to everything under the sun! But not me. I’m pretty sturdy, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. No known allergies. Alright, Venna, let’s get a few measurements taken. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll want to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. Just try not to poke too much, alright? My skin's gotten kinda thin as I’ve gotten older.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is reading 162 over 94. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look fine, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing concerning. I'm also noticing a little bit of swelling in your ankles. Is this new?
PATIENT: Oh my. 162? Is that bad? I don't rightly know what those numbers mean. And yes, the ankles... now that you mention it, they have been a little puffy lately. I figured it was just from bein' on my feet too long, bakin’ all day. But maybe it's somethin’ more? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. Is there somethin' seriously wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Now, Venna, let’s not jump to conclusions. 162 over 94 is elevated, yes. It’s what we call hypertension, or high blood pressure. And the swelling in your ankles could be related. It's not necessarily something seriously wrong, but it’s definitely something we need to investigate further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few lab tests. These will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other possible causes for your high blood pressure and swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. I don’t much like needles, Doctor. But…if you think it’s important, I reckon I can handle it. Just try to be quick, alright? And tell me what all them tests are for, so I know what we're lookin’ at. I like knowin’ what’s happenin’, if you don’t mind. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I completely understand. We’ll be as quick as possible. The tests are quite routine. First, we'll do a Complete Metabolic Panel, which checks your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. Then, we’ll do a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol. And finally, a Complete Blood Count, which looks at your red and white blood cells. These tests will help us determine if your high blood pressure is causing any damage to your organs and rule out other potential causes, like kidney disease or electrolyte imbalances. It will also help us determine the best course of treatment for you. We'll just need a small sample of blood for each test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… thorough, I suppose. Kidneys, electrolytes, blood… Alright. As long as it helps figure out what's wrong, I guess I can handle a few pokes. But no poking around more than you have to, alright? And… what if somethin' is wrong? What if it’s somethin’ serious? I don’t want to be lookin' at a whole lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venna. It's natural to worry. We're not assuming anything is seriously wrong, and these tests are simply to give us a clearer picture. If something is detected, we'll discuss all your options thoroughly and create a treatment plan that's right for you. There are many effective treatments for high blood pressure, and often, it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. We will also discuss your family history to get a better understanding of your risk for heart issues. Do you know if anyone in your family has ever had high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a little frail, and the doctor said somethin’ about her heart bein’ weak. And my older brother, bless his soul, he had a stroke about ten years ago. He didn't recover too well from that. That runnin’ in the family, I reckon. Does that mean I’m gonna end up like them?
DOCTOR: That information is helpful, Venna. Knowing your family history of high blood pressure and stroke does increase your risk, but it doesn’t mean you’re destined to experience the same fate. It simply means we need to be more proactive in managing your health. Given your family history and elevated blood pressure, I recommend starting a low-dose medication to help control your blood pressure. We'll also discuss some lifestyle changes, such as reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and managing stress. Would you be open to trying medication?
PATIENT: Medication… Oh dear. I really don't like takin' pills, Doctor. But… if it'll help, and you think it's important... I reckon I can try. But I don't want nothin' that'll make me feel all muddled and sleepy. I still gotta bake, you know? And garden. I can't be laid up in bed all day. What kind of pills are we talkin' about? And what if they don't work?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venna. We'll start with a very low dose of a medication called Lisinopril. It's a common medication for high blood pressure, and it usually has minimal side effects. Some people experience a slight cough or dizziness, but those usually go away within a few days. It rarely causes significant drowsiness or confusion. If Lisinopril doesn't work, or if you experience side effects, we have other options we can try. We'll work together to find a medication that's right for you. It's important to remember that managing high blood pressure is a process, and it may take some time to find the right treatment plan. I’ll write you a prescription for Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, to be taken once a day. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. 10 milligrams... I’ll try it, then. If it makes me feel awful, I’m comin’ right back to see you, mind you! And… what about the gardenin’? And the bakin’? Can I still do those things? I don’t want to have to give up my hobbies.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. You should absolutely be able to continue gardening and baking! Those are important parts of your life, and we wouldn't want to take those away from you. The goal of medication is to help improve your quality of life, not diminish it. Just be sure to stay hydrated while gardening, and try to limit your salt intake when baking. I’ll also give you some information on healthy eating and stress management techniques. I'll also recommend you check your blood pressure at home to monitor your progress. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have one of those fancy cuffs. Never needed one before. My regular doctor never told me to get one. But… I reckon I can get one, if you think it’s important. My granddaughter, Sarah, she's good at orderin’ things online. She can probably get one for me. So, pills once a day, watch the salt, keep bakin’ and gardenin’, and get a cuff. Is that everything? I feel kinda overwhelmed, Doctor. It's a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot to remember, Venna. And it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. To recap: You'll take 10 milligrams of Lisinopril once a day. We discussed watching your salt intake, and continuing your hobbies. And yes, getting a blood pressure cuff would be very helpful. Your granddaughter can easily order one online, and I’ll give you some instructions on how to use it. I’ll also write down all these instructions for you, along with the name and dosage of your medication. I’ll give you a pamphlet with information on high blood pressure and healthy living. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Venna?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not right now, anyway. You’ve explained everything pretty well, I reckon. I just hope these pills don’t make me feel too poorly. And I really don’t want to have to give up my bakin’. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old lady like me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to go sit down and have a cup of tea. All this talkin’ has made me thirsty.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I'm here to help. And absolutely go sit down and have a cup of tea. You deserve it. Here are those written instructions, and the pamphlet. I'll see you in two weeks. Take care of yourself, Venna. And enjoy your tea!
