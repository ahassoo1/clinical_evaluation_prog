DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well now… it’s me ears, I think. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are kinda muffled, see? Hard to hear folks talkin’. Not sure when it started, honestly. A little bit at a time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Muffled, you say. And it’s been gradual?
PATIENT: Yep, gradual. Like… slow, ya know? Not like a bang, suddenly gone quiet. More like someone turned the volume down little by little. I mostly notice it when there’s… well, noise. Like if the TV’s on and someone’s talkin’. Or in a restaurant. It all just kinda… blends together. Though, even quiet talkin’ sometimes gets lost on me. I don’t know. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: Right. So, more difficulty with background noise, and even quiet conversations are becoming challenging. Have you noticed it's worse in one ear, or about the same in both?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… I think it’s both. Maybe the left one’s a tiny bit worse? But honestly, Doctor, it’s hard to tell. I wouldn’t swear on it. They both just don't pick things up like they used to. I used to be able to hear a pin drop! Now… well, you get the idea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone else commented on your hearing, or have you noticed yourself asking people to repeat things more often?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My niece, bless her heart, she’s always sayin’ “Uncle Betty, speak up!” And I catch meself askin’ folks to repeat things all the time. “Huh? What was that?” That’s become a real common phrase for me, I reckon. It’s embarrassing, really. I don't want to be that old man, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, increasing difficulty hearing, more pronounced with background noise, and people frequently commenting on your ability to hear. Have you ever worked around loud noises?
PATIENT: Loud noises… hmm. Well, now… I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must’ve been forty years. Runnin’ the machines. They were loud. Really loud, clackin’ and whirrin’ all day long. Didn’t think much of it at the time, ya know? Everyone wore earplugs, mostly. But… I suppose that could have somethin’ to do with it. Never connected the two, if ya understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s relevant. Prolonged exposure to loud noises is a common cause of hearing loss. Now, have you experienced any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Sometimes. A little bit. Not constant, mind ya. Just… occasionally. Like a high-pitched whine, almost. But it doesn't last long. Dizziness… no, not really. Though I am a bit unsteady on me feet sometimes, but I figure that's just old age creepin' in. Fullness… no, can’t say I’ve noticed that. Just… quiet. Everything’s kinda quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're experiencing a fairly typical case of age-related hearing loss, likely exacerbated by your work history. We'll need to do a quick hearing test to get a baseline and confirm the extent of the loss. I’ll have the audiologist come in and do that for you now. It shouldn’t take too long.
PATIENT: Oh, a test, huh? Alright. That sounds… sensible. I’m happy to do whatever ya think is best, Doctor. As long as it might help me hear a bit better, ya know? I just want to be able to hear what folks are sayin’. A test sounds good. When will this… audiologist be comin’?
DOCTOR: She’s just down the hall. I'll have her come in right away. It’s a simple procedure; she’ll put headphones on you and play some tones. Just tell her when you can and can't hear them. Don't worry about it. I’ll be back to discuss the results once she’s finished. And please, try not to strain to hear if you're unsure. It’s best to be honest.
PATIENT: Honest, ya? Yes, I’m always honest. I’ll be honest. Just… tones, ya say? Headphones… Alright. I'll just sit here and wait, then. Thank ya, Doctor. I appreciate ya lookin’ into it. I hope it's not too bad.
