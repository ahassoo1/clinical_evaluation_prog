DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, really. A bad one. It won’t seem to get better. It hurts to walk, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing and causing you pain with walking. I understand. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, like a little cut, maybe from a slipper. But it just… got bigger. Now it’s red, and sometimes it weeps a little. And the pain… oh, the pain is sharp when I put weight on it. It’s been like this for… oh, I don’t know. A few weeks, I think. Maybe longer. Time goes so fast these days.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, or maybe longer… that’s alright, we’ll figure it out. It sounds like it started as a small cut and has become red and painful, and sometimes it’s weeping. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. When I first get up in the morning, it’s the worst. Really sharp. Then it dulls a little when I’ve been walking around a bit, but it always comes back if I stand for too long. And if I try to wear shoes… oh, no, that’s bad. Really bad. I mostly wear slippers now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the morning, improves with activity, but then returns with prolonged standing, and shoes aggravate it. Have you noticed any swelling around the sore, or any pus or discharge other than the weeping you mentioned?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked for swelling. I mostly just try not to look at it too much, it makes me sad. But there is… sometimes a little wetness. Like I said, it weeps. Is that pus? I don’t know what pus looks like. I’ve always been a healthy man, never had much trouble with sores before. But my daughter, she told me I should come in. She worries about my sugar.
DOCTOR: That’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in, and it's smart of her to be mindful of your sugar levels. Weeping can sometimes be a sign of infection, and that's something we want to check. Let’s take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, go ahead. It doesn't bother me to have you look. I’m just hoping you can help me walk without so much pain. It’s hard to do my job when my foot hurts so. I teach the little ones, you see. They need a lot of energy!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you’ll have a seat here on the table, and I’ll take a look. I’m going to gently examine your foot, and I may ask you a few questions while I do. Alright. I see the sore on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It’s approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter, with some redness and some moistness. There's some hardening of the skin around the edges. I don't see any significant swelling at this moment. Does it hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… that does hurt a bit. Not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable. Like a… a sharp pinch. And it feels warm, Doctor. I hadn’t noticed it before, but now that you’re touching it… it’s warmer than the rest of my foot. Is that bad? I've always kept my feet cool. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's tender to the touch, and you’re noticing it feels warm. Warmth can be a sign of inflammation or infection. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to check your circulation and sensation in your foot. Then, I think it would be a good idea to get a swab of the sore to see if there’s any infection present. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Circulation and sensation… and the swab. I just want this pain to go away. And I want to keep teaching my little ones. They’re counting on me, you see. It’s important work. So yes, please. Do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Your pulses are present and feel normal. Your sensation seems a bit diminished, but not severely so, which can be common with age. Now, I’m going to gently swab the sore to send to the lab. It might feel a little uncomfortable for just a moment. Okay, that’s all done. It should only take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, to protect the sore and prevent further infection, I recommend keeping it clean and dry, and avoiding putting too much weight on your foot. I’d also like to check your blood sugar levels today, as your daughter mentioned, to rule out diabetes as a possible contributing factor. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Clean and dry, and less weight on my foot. I can do that. Slippers it is, then. And the blood sugar… yes, that sounds wise. My daughter said something about that. It runs in the family, she thinks. So yes, please check it. I want to know what's going on, you see. And I want to get back to teaching my little ones as soon as I can. They miss me when I’m gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get your blood sugar checked now. Your blood sugar is a little elevated at 185. That doesn't necessarily mean you have diabetes, but it's high enough that we should investigate further. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a hemoglobin A1C test, which will give us a better picture of your overall health and blood sugar control. While we're waiting for the lab results, I recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, or fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds very thorough, Doctor. A comprehensive… panel, you said? And the A1C test. I trust your judgement. One week, then. And I'll watch for those things - the pain, the redness, the swelling, the pus, and the fever. My daughter will help me with that. She's very good at looking after me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go sit down for a bit. This has been a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. And it’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you some written instructions about wound care and monitoring for infection. Let me know if you have any questions before you leave. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I think… I think that's all for now. I'll let my daughter handle the questions. She’s very good at remembering things. Thank you again.
