DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse, a nice young woman, she told me my cholesterol was a bit high after some blood work. That’s what I’m here about, I suppose. Never had trouble with that before, not that I recall anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. High cholesterol. And you said this is the first you’re hearing of it?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. First I’ve heard. I feel alright, you know? A little creaky in the mornings, but that's just old age, I always say. Never been one for fancy foods, either. Mostly just simple Swedish cooking, like my wife used to make. Lots of fish and potatoes.
DOCTOR: Fish and potatoes, you say. Interesting. Now, when was this blood work done exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think... it was just last week, I believe. The 26th of July. Yes, that sounds right. The nurse called me a couple days after that with the results. She said I should come in and see you, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, July 26th. Okay. And just to be clear, you haven't been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain in your legs when you walk?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothing like that. Not a twinge. I walk to the store most days, about a half-mile, and I’m still managing that just fine. Bit slow, maybe, but fine. I'd know if somethin’ was wrong with my chest or legs, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, sir, never. I’ve been pretty lucky, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old. My wife, bless her soul, she had a little trouble with her arthritis in her knees, but I never had much trouble myself. I’ve been to the doctor for yearly check-ups, and they always said I was as healthy as could be for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, must’ve been around ten years old. And I had a little skin tag removed off my back a few years back, but that wasn’t much of a surgery, really. Just a quick snip from the doctor. Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father lived to be 92, a good long life. He was a fisherman, strong as an ox. My mother, she passed away when I was young, from pneumonia, I think. As for heart trouble... hmm. My uncle on my mother’s side, he had a stroke when he was in his 70s. That’s all I can really recall. Nobody else in the family had any major health problems that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. Never been much of a pill-taker, if you know what I mean. I believe in a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet. That’s always been my medicine. And a little bit of Swedish coffee, of course, but not too much!
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir, none that I know of. I've eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction. Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but that's just a sneeze or two. Nothing serious. I’m a pretty simple man, really, not prone to allergies or complications.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Standard procedure, you understand. Then we'll discuss the results and what, if anything, needs to be done. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’m not afraid of a little examination. I’ve always figured a good doctor should have a listen, just to be sure. I’ll just sit here and try not to wiggle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 148 over 85. A little elevated. Heart sounds are… regular, but a bit faint. Pulse is 72, a little weak. Pulses are present, but diminished in your ankles. I’m also noticing some mild edema, or swelling, in your feet and ankles. Have you noticed that yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm, now that you mention it… yes, I have. My shoes have been feeling a little tighter lately. I just figured it was the heat, you know? Swelling up a bit in the summer. Didn't think much of it. Faint heart sounds...that doesn't sound good, does it?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s something we need to investigate. The elevated blood pressure and diminished pulses are also concerning, especially with the edema. I'd like to order a lipid panel to get a more detailed look at your cholesterol levels, and an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. We should also check your kidney function. It's important to rule out any underlying issues, even if you feel fine.
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I may feel alright, but I’m not one to argue with a professional. A lipid panel, EKG… and something about my kidneys? Alright. Just let me know what I need to do, and I’ll do it.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the lipid panel and send you to the lab for the EKG. They’ll need a urine sample as well for the kidney function test. We’ll get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to reduce your sodium intake. Avoid processed foods, fast food, and limit your salt usage at home. It’s unlikely to be a major factor, given your overall health, but it’s a good place to start. We will review the results when they are available and then we can decide if any further investigation or treatment is needed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I understand. Less salt, avoid processed foods... I think I can manage that. My wife always said I used a bit too much salt in my cooking, so maybe this is a good excuse to cut back. A bit of a challenge, but I’ll do my best. So, blood work, EKG, and a urine sample. And then we wait for the results. Alright.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, yes, actually. This all sounds a bit concerning, if I'm honest. Is this something serious, Doctor? Could this be... a heart problem? I’m not wanting to worry unnecessarily, but I'd like to have a bit of an idea what we’re looking at.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, it’s too early to say definitively whether this is a heart problem. We need the results of the tests to determine the cause of your symptoms – or, in this case, lack thereof, coupled with abnormal findings. However, elevated blood pressure, diminished pulses, and edema can be indicative of underlying cardiovascular issues. It could also be something else entirely. We're being thorough to rule things out, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I understand. Rule things out. Not wanting to jump to conclusions. I suppose that makes sense. So, it could be something else. Not necessarily a heart problem, but something we need to investigate. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a bit at ease just explaining it. I’ll go see the nurse now and get these tests scheduled.
DOCTOR: Good. Do that. And try not to worry unduly. We'll have a better understanding once we have the results. The nurse will be right with you.
PATIENT: .
