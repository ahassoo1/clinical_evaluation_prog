DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Rosanova. Well, as I mentioned to the receptionist, I’m here for… a check-up before a surgery. A cosmetic surgery, that is. Though, honestly, the details are a little… fuzzy. I just know my surgeon wants me cleared beforehand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative check-up. That’s perfectly reasonable. And you said the details are a little fuzzy?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It's… difficult to explain. It was some time ago, and there’s been a lot happening since. I think it’s a face lift? Or something to do with my cheeks, perhaps? My husband… he arranged everything. It was his idea, really. And now… well, he’s gone. So the specifics have sort of… slipped my mind. I apologize for being so vague. I remember wanting to feel better about myself, and he was very supportive, but the why and the how are… elusive.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mackenzi. Life happens, and details can get lost, especially during difficult times. It's alright. We can still get everything sorted. Do you have any paperwork from the surgeon’s office detailing the procedure?
PATIENT: I believe so. He gave me a packet. Let me see… Ah, yes, here's a consent form, and… some post-operative instructions. I don’t think there’s a detailed description of the procedure itself, though. Mostly just… what to expect afterward. It’s all a bit overwhelming, truthfully. I hadn’t looked at it closely until just now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is for a lower face and neck lift with cheek augmentation. And Dr. Ramirez is your surgeon, excellent. Let’s just quickly go through some basics to make sure we’re on the same page, and to get a good baseline for your health. First, are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or discomfort at all. Not currently, no. I’ve felt… a bit tired lately, but I attribute that to everything else, honestly. Just the general stress, I suppose. Nothing unusual, no. I’ve been sleeping alright, eating reasonably well, and… I try to keep active with my work, though it can be demanding, you know, landscaping. Lifting plants and things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the sleeping and eating. Landscaping is definitely active work – good for you staying on your feet, but we'll need to keep that in mind regarding your recovery. Okay, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments, so I wasn’t always privy to everything. I believe I had slightly high cholesterol at one point, but it was well-managed with diet, I think. Nothing requiring medication, as far as I recall. I don’t have any known allergies, and… no asthma or heart problems. Just… the cholesterol, potentially. Oh! And I had chickenpox as a child. Does that count? It feels like a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Chickenpox is good to know, but we’re more concerned with anything current. Okay, so potentially managed cholesterol, no other known medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… besides what I'm here for, of course. I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, I remember that being rather unpleasant. And… oh! I broke my wrist a few years ago, gardening, ironically enough. It required a cast, but it healed well. Nothing major, really. Those are the only surgeries I can recall. Is there a list somewhere that I should be checking against? I worry I'm missing something.
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about it, you're doing great. It's perfectly normal to forget details. Tonsils and a wrist fracture, noted. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I take a daily multivitamin, just for general health. And… this is for occasional headaches. Just ibuprofen, nothing strong. I rarely need it, thankfully. And… oh! My neighbor gave me some chamomile tea for sleep, but I haven’t been using it much lately. That’s it, I think. Just the vitamin, the ibuprofen, and the occasional tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, chamomile tea. Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. No food allergies, no allergies to medications… I don’t even get hay fever, which is surprising, considering all the time I spend outdoors. I seem to be quite lucky in that regard. Is that everything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mackenzi. Thank you for that detailed history. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Please, proceed. I want to make sure everything is as it should be. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just loosen your shirt a little, that would be helpful. Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is good. Pulse is 72 and regular. Let’s just take a look in your ears… Ears are clear. Now, I'll just quickly palpate your thyroid… Thyroid is normal, no enlargement noted. Overall, you appear to be in good general health. I'm going to check your weight and height, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. I haven't had any trouble with my ears lately, so that’s good to hear. Please, proceed with the weight and height. I haven't been weighed in quite some time, actually. Hopefully it hasn't changed too much. All that gardening!
DOCTOR: Alright, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 93 kilograms. That gives you a BMI of 36.6, which is in the obese range. Now, this isn't to cause alarm, Mackenzi, but it's important information for your surgeon to know, as it can affect anesthesia and recovery. We might want to discuss some strategies for weight management down the line, but for now, we'll focus on getting you cleared for surgery. Do you have any history of sleep apnea – do you snore loudly, or stop breathing during sleep?
PATIENT: Oh. That… is a bit concerning, isn't it? I hadn’t realized… well, it’s been some time since I last saw a doctor. My husband used to say I snored a little, but he was a heavy sleeper himself, so I don’t think he truly noticed. I don't think I stop breathing, no. I’ve never been told that, and I usually sleep quite soundly. Though… I do feel tired often, as I mentioned. But I just assumed it was from the work. Is it something I should be particularly worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being so open, Mackenzi. Snoring and daytime fatigue can be signs of sleep apnea, and it's something we want to rule out before surgery, as it can increase the risk of complications during anesthesia. It's a common condition, and very treatable. Given your BMI and the fatigue, I’m going to recommend a sleep study. It's a simple test that monitors your breathing while you sleep. Your surgeon will likely want those results before proceeding. Now, before we talk about the study, do you have any other medical concerns – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: A sleep study… that sounds a bit intimidating, honestly. Let me think… no, I don't think there’s anything else. My hands ache sometimes, after a long day of gardening, but that’s to be expected, I suppose. And… I get headaches occasionally, but as I said, just regular tension headaches. Nothing severe. Oh! And my vision isn't what it used to be, so I wear reading glasses. But that's been stable for years. I truly don’t think there’s anything else, Doctor. It’s just… the tiredness, and now this sleep study. It all feels a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mackenzi. A sleep study can seem daunting, but it's a painless and relatively simple test. It's better to be proactive and identify any potential issues before surgery. Okay, so no significant medical concerns besides the tiredness, occasional headaches, and stable vision with reading glasses. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any herbal supplements, or using any over-the-counter creams or medications?
PATIENT: Herbal supplements… no, not at all. I prefer to stick to regular vitamins, if anything. And… creams… let me think. I use a hand cream after gardening, to soothe my skin, but it’s just a regular moisturizer, nothing medicated. Oh! And I use a sunscreen, of course, to protect my skin from the sun. But that’s it. Just the moisturizer and the sunscreen. Nothing else. I’m very careful about what I put on my skin, actually. I spend so much time outdoors, I try to be mindful of protecting it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mackenzi. Alright, so no herbal supplements or medicated creams. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, you’re generally in reasonable health for surgery, with the caveat that we need to rule out sleep apnea with a study. I’m going to write you a referral to a sleep center. They'll schedule you for the study and interpret the results. I also recommend you discuss your BMI with your surgeon, as it can affect anesthesia risks and recovery. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A sleep study… and talking to the surgeon about my weight… it’s a lot. Yes, actually, I do have a question. What… what happens if the sleep study does show something? Will they cancel the surgery? I was really hoping to… to finally feel better about myself, and now this… It’s just… I’ve been looking forward to this for so long.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mackenzi. It’s completely understandable to be anxious about that. If the sleep study does show sleep apnea, it doesn’t necessarily mean the surgery will be cancelled. It simply means we need to address the condition first. Sleep apnea increases the risks of complications during and after anesthesia, so your surgeon will want to make sure it’s adequately treated. This might involve a CPAP machine, weight management, or other interventions. Once the condition is under control, the surgery can likely proceed as planned. It might just be delayed slightly. The important thing is to be proactive and address any potential risks. Your surgeon will discuss the best course of action with you based on the results of the study. I'll also put a note in your chart recommending you discuss the potential need for a pre-operative cardiology consult, given your BMI, just to be extra cautious. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: A cardiology consult… it feels like a lot of tests. But… I suppose it's better to be safe. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and address all my concerns. And thank you for the referral to the sleep center. I'll schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s my job to make sure you’re fully informed and prepared. No, nothing else for now. I’ll send the referral to the sleep center electronically. You should receive a call from them within a few business days to schedule an appointment. Please feel free to reach out to the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll also send your primary care physician a summary of our visit. I’m confident that we can get everything sorted out and get you on the path to feeling better. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mackenzi. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Rosanova. Thank you again for everything. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. I will schedule the sleep study right away. Have a good day.
