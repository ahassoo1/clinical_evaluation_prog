DOCTOR: Hello, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too. Um, it’s about my bruising. It’s just… a lot more than usual, and I’m on blood thinners, so I figured I should get it checked out. I don’t want to waste your time, I just want to make sure nothing serious is going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising more than usual… and you’re already on blood thinners, which is good you’re thinking ahead to mention that. It’s never a waste of time to get things checked out, Courtnye. Let’s talk about this bruising. When did you first notice it being worse than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe two weeks ago? I bumped my arm on the corner of the kitchen counter – a really light bump, honestly – and it turned purple instantly. Usually it just gets a little sore, maybe a small bruise later. But this… this was different. Then a couple of other little things have been the same way. It’s hard to explain, it’s just… easier bruising, I guess.
DOCTOR: Easier bruising is a good way to put it. Two weeks ago… and it seems to be happening with very minor bumps. Okay. Have you noticed the bruising in any particular areas of your body more than others?
PATIENT: Mostly my arms and legs, actually. I’m not… clumsy or anything, so it’s not like I’m constantly falling or running into things. And it’s not always after a bump, sometimes I’ll just notice a bruise and not even remember how I got it. Which is kinda weird, right?
DOCTOR: It can be a little weird, yes. Not remembering how you got a bruise is something we should definitely look into. Do you have any bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, or have you noticed any nosebleeds more frequently than usual?
PATIENT: No, my gums are fine, and no extra nosebleeds. I get the occasional one, like everyone does when it’s dry, but nothing more than usual. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I did have a small cut on my finger a few days ago, and it took a long time to stop bleeding. Longer than it should have, I think. Just a little paper cut, but… it just wouldn’t clot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know, Courtnye. A cut taking longer to clot… that's something we need to consider along with the bruising. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… high blood pressure, and that’s it. I take medicine for that, but it’s been pretty well controlled for years. And the blood thinners, of course, because of a blood clot a few years back. Nothing major, honestly. I’m usually pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled, and blood thinners due to a clot a few years ago. Do you remember what kind of clot it was, and roughly when it happened?
PATIENT: It was a deep vein thrombosis in my leg… February of 2022, I think. I was pretty sick, stuck in the hospital for a week. They put me on warfarin after that, but I switched to… apixaban? Is that right? A couple of years ago now. My doctor said it was easier. I've been pretty good about taking it regularly, I promise.
DOCTOR: Apixaban, yes. And you’ve been consistent with taking it. Good. Let’s talk about family history. Has anyone in your family had issues with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandfather, on my mom’s side, he had something… a blood disorder, I think. But I don't really know the details. My mom didn't talk about it much. She just said he was always a “bleeder” and had to be careful. But that was a long time ago, and nobody else in the family has had problems. It wasn't like a common thing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandfather with a bleeding issue, not common in the rest of the family. That's good information. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't drink, never have. And definitely no smoking or drugs. I try to eat healthy, mostly. It’s hard sometimes, but I do my best. I walk a lot, try to stay active. I don’t want to cause any problems with my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, just to confirm, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take most medicines without a problem. I’m pretty boring that way, honestly. Nothing exciting ever happens with me. Except for this bruising, of course. Which is kinda worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Courtnye. You’ve been very helpful with all this information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Let's get it done. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And hopefully it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140/90, but that could be from being anxious about the bruising. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at the bruising. Okay, I see several bruises here. They vary in size and color, some are newer, some are older. I'm not feeling any significant swelling or warmth around them. Do these areas feel tender to the touch?
PATIENT: They’re a little sore if I press really hard, but not like… painful, you know? Just a dull ache. And honestly, it feels like more bruises keep popping up. I noticed a new one on my shin this morning. It’s kinda scary, seeing them just… appear. Is it possible the apixaban isn’t working right? Or… could it be something else?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Courtnye, and we definitely need to investigate. New bruises appearing frequently is concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s happening, I’m going to order some blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, your coagulation studies – that will tell us how well your blood is clotting – and a liver function panel. It’s just to rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests are fine. I just want to figure this out. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to stop taking the apixaban for the tests? Or anything else I should do before?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. And no, you don’t need to stop taking the apixaban before the blood tests. In fact, it’s important to continue taking it as prescribed unless I specifically tell you otherwise. I will call you as soon as the results are back and we can discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause you to bump or injure yourself. If you experience any unusual bleeding – like nosebleeds that won’t stop, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bruising – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figuring out what to do. It’s been worrying me a lot. I’ll wait for your call. And I'll be careful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out, and I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Take care, and have a good day.
