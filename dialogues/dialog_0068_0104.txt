DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now, I think. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It’s just… painful to swallow. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Painful swallowing… Okay. A little while now. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It hurts when I eat, when I drink… when I just… swallow. I told you. It’s been… maybe a week? Or more? I don’t know! It's not important. Is it serious? Because I really don't have time for a long illness.
DOCTOR: A week or more… Alright. And is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? Look, it’s not like a broken leg, Doctor. It’s not always hurting, but it’s… there. It gets worse when I try to eat something solid. Soup is… okay. But anything else? Forget about it. It's just… annoying, really. Can we please just get to the bottom of this? I don’t like being sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with solids. Any fever, chills, or cough accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't felt warm. And no cough. Just… this throat. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a doctor. I just know my throat hurts. Do you need me to list all the things that aren't happening? Because I can. It's just a sore throat. Shouldn’t there be something simple you can give me for it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no chills, no cough. And you haven’t noticed any rash, ear pain, or difficulty breathing, correct?
PATIENT: Rash? No. Ear pain? No. Difficulty breathing? Absolutely not. I can breathe just fine, thank you very much. Are you trying to trick me, Doctor? I'm telling you, it’s my throat. It hurts when I swallow. That's it. Can we move on? I have better things to do than play twenty questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. Let’s just take a quick look at your throat, then we can discuss possible causes and treatment. It will help me understand what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look at it? Fine. But be quick. I really don’t have all day. And don’t use those cold metal things. I hate those. Just… get it over with. I hope you know what you’re doing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, just open wide and say "ah." I'll be as quick as possible. Your throat is definitely red, and your tonsils look a little swollen. No visible pus or significant lesions that I can see. Any pain when I gently touch the sides of your throat?
PATIENT: Yes! It hurts when you poke around in there. Honestly, Doctor, did you have to push so hard? It's already sore! Just… stop. What does it mean? Is it something serious? I really need to know if I can go back to work. I can't afford to be out sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. It’s tender to the touch, as you mentioned. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it seems most likely you have a viral pharyngitis – a sore throat caused by a virus. It’s very common, and usually resolves on its own within a week or so. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take nothing. I don’t like pills. And a virus? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a child. I know what a virus is. It just hurts. Can you give me something to make it stop hurting, or do I just have to suffer? I have work to do, you know. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you don’t have any known allergies, we can try some symptomatic relief. I can recommend a throat lozenge or spray to help soothe the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also help. Plenty of fluids and rest are important as well. However, if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or if the pain worsens significantly, you need to seek medical attention immediately. Given your lack of insurance, I want to be cautious. Do you have anyone who can monitor you?
PATIENT: Monitor me? Look, I can take care of myself. I’ve lived a long life just fine. I don't need someone "monitoring" me. And lozenges? Really? I can buy those at the store. This whole thing has been a waste of time. Just… write down whatever you’re going to write down, and let me leave. I need to get home. And don't expect me to come back. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm writing down a recommendation for symptomatic treatment: throat lozenges, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and plenty of fluids. Here you go. And I do want to emphasize, if things worsen, please seek immediate medical attention. Given your insurance situation, the closest urgent care is… …about 30 minutes away. Do you understand?
