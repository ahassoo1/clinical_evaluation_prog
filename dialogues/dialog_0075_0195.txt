DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, but my daughter, she said I needed to come. She says I’m always a bit down and thought a little note from a real doctor might cheer me up. You know, one of those “Get Well” cards? Or… encouragement, maybe? I don’t really feel sick, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Janeth. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in, and I'm happy she did. We take all concerns seriously here. It's good to check in, even if you don’t feel physically unwell. It sounds like your daughter is concerned about your mood. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, everything just feels… blah. Not bad, exactly. Just… lacking something. I used to be so busy, always doing things for the family, for the temple, for everyone. Now… the kids are grown, my husband mostly keeps to himself, and there’s not much to do, you know? It’s not like I’m crying all the time or anything. I just… don’t have the energy for things anymore. It's probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant life transition, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a shift in your energy and motivation when those changes happen. It’s not necessarily about “old age,” as you say, but adjusting to a new rhythm. “Blah” is a very good way to put it, actually. To get a better understanding, let's talk a bit more about what a typical day looks like for you now. Can you describe your routine?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… well, I wake up, make tea for my husband and me – he’s not much of a morning person, you know? Then I do the housework, mostly. Cooking, cleaning… the usual. He likes his dal bhat, so I make sure that’s always ready. Sometimes I’ll chat with the neighbors, but they mostly talk about things I don’t care for – gossip, mostly. In the evening, we watch TV. It's all very… repetitive. Not much excitement, to be honest. It’s not a bad life, just… not very fulfilling anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you've been a very dedicated caregiver for many years, and now that some of those responsibilities have shifted, you’re finding yourself with more time but perhaps less… purpose. Do you find yourself enjoying anything these days?
PATIENT: Enjoying things…? Hmm. Well, I like it when my grandchildren come to visit. They're a handful, but they brighten things up. And I still enjoy cooking, even if it's just for my husband. But that's about it, really. I used to be very involved with the temple, helping with the decorations and the festivals. But my arthritis has been acting up, so I can’t do much of that anymore. It feels like all the things I used to love, I can't do them like I used to. It’s just… disappointing.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Janeth. It’s frustrating when physical limitations prevent you from doing things you enjoy. And it sounds like you’re also feeling a sense of loss with your decreased involvement at the temple. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep… that’s been a bit off, to be honest. I don't sleep badly, exactly, but I wake up a lot during the night. Just little things, you know? A noise, or thinking about things. And my appetite… it’s not as good as it used to be. I still eat, but I don’t really enjoy it. Everything tastes… bland. My husband keeps telling me I need to eat more, but it's hard when I don't feel hungry. It’s probably just age, like I said. Everything slows down eventually.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Janeth. While it could be related to age, the changes in your sleep and appetite, combined with the loss of enjoyment in activities and feeling generally "blah," are things we should explore a bit further. Now, have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of wanting to be alone?
PATIENT: Hopelessness…? Oh, no, not like that. I wouldn’t say hopeless. Just… a bit discouraged, maybe. And wanting to be alone… well, sometimes. My husband is a quiet man, bless him, but sometimes I just need a bit of peace and quiet. I don’t want to bother him with my… feelings. He has enough on his plate. It's not that I don't like being with him, just… sometimes I need to be on my own to think. Or not think, really. Just… be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're managing a lot, and it's admirable that you're trying to be considerate of your husband's needs as well. Before we move on, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my arthritis, of course. The doctor diagnosed it years ago, and I take some medication for it. And I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder a long time ago, but they removed it, so that’s all sorted. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a healthy woman, to be honest. Never really been sick, aside from the usual colds and flu. My husband always says I'm too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And you mentioned medication for your arthritis – can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's a little white pill. I always just ask my husband to refill it for me. He goes to the pharmacy, you see. I think… it starts with an 'M'? No, maybe a 'D'? Oh, dear, I'm terrible with names. It’s just one pill, twice a day. He always makes sure I have enough. I really should pay more attention to these things, shouldn’t I? But I just trust him to handle it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Janeth. It's common to rely on family members for these things. We can certainly look it up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies. Never had any. I can eat anything, thankfully. My husband is the picky one, he doesn’t like spicy food. But me? I can eat anything. I used to make all sorts of different dishes for the temple festivals, and no one ever had any problems. I always made sure everything was fresh and clean, of course. A good cook always pays attention to these things.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? Well, I was born in Nepal, of course. We moved here many years ago, when my husband got a job. We have three children, all grown up now and with families of their own. I see them when I can, but they're busy, you know? It’s good to have family, but it's not the same as it used to be. We have some friends in the community, mostly other Nepalese families. We get together sometimes for festivals and celebrations, but it's not like having close friends, really. We just… talk about things. The weather, the children, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Janeth. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any obvious physical causes for how you're feeling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, alright? My arthritis, you know. It can be a bit painful sometimes. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding, but please, don't make me feel like a broken machine.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72, which is a normal rate. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. It doesn't reveal any obvious causes for how you're feeling. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of mild depression.
PATIENT: Depression…? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. I’m not sad, exactly. Just… blah, like I said. Is that what depression is? Feeling blah? I always thought depression was for people who were crying all the time, or… doing terrible things. I haven't done anything terrible. I just… don’t feel like doing things anymore. Is it serious? Will I need… medicine? I don’t like taking medicine.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel confused and frightened, Janeth. Depression presents differently in everyone. It's not always about feeling sad or crying. Fatigue, loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep, and feeling generally “blah” – these are all common symptoms. And you haven’t done anything wrong. It's not a character flaw or a sign of weakness. It sounds like you’re experiencing some of those symptoms. As for whether you’ll need medication, that’s something we can discuss. It’s not always necessary, and there are other options, such as therapy – talking to a professional to help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies. We can start with some simple lifestyle changes and see how you feel. If those aren't enough, we can consider other options. Would you be open to discussing some of those options, and perhaps getting a referral to a therapist?
PATIENT: Therapy… talking to someone…? Oh, goodness. I don't know. I’m not very good at talking about my feelings. I always just keep things to myself. And I don’t want to bother anyone with my problems. What if they think I’m silly? Or… crazy? I’ve never done anything like that before. Lifestyle changes… what does that even mean? Should I start doing more housework? My husband says I already do too much. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds very… complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive, Janeth. It takes courage to even consider talking to someone, and it’s okay to feel unsure. And rest assured, therapists are trained to be non-judgmental and provide a safe and confidential space for you to explore your feelings. They won’t think you’re silly or crazy – their job is to help you understand and cope with whatever’s going on. Lifestyle changes can be quite simple. It could be as small as incorporating a short walk into your daily routine, spending more time with loved ones, or finding a hobby you enjoy. It's not about adding more to your plate, but about finding things that bring you joy and help you feel more connected. How about this?
PATIENT: Yes? Go on, Doctor. I'm listening. But I'm still a little… worried. About all of it. Talking to strangers, changing my life… it sounds like a lot. It's just… I'm used to things being a certain way. And I don't want to upset things.
DOCTOR: I understand that. It’s completely normal to feel resistant to change, especially when you’re comfortable with your routine. How about we start small?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Small. That sounds… less scary. Tell me about small.
DOCTOR: Alright. For now, let’s focus on one thing. Would you be willing to try keeping a simple mood journal for a week?
PATIENT: A… journal? You mean writing down how I feel? Every day? Oh, goodness. I haven't written anything since school. I'm not very good at writing. And what would I even write? “I feel blah”? That doesn't sound very helpful, does it? I suppose it wouldn't hurt, but I don't see how just writing things down will make me feel any better.
DOCTOR: You don't have to write a novel, Janeth. Just a few sentences about how you're feeling each day. It doesn't have to be perfect, or even grammatically correct. It's just a way to become more aware of your emotions and identify any patterns. If writing feels difficult, you can just jot down a few words – "tired," "lonely," "grateful" – whatever comes to mind. The goal is not to write beautifully, but to simply check in with yourself. And it's perfectly alright if you skip a day or two. It's not a test, and there are no right or wrong answers. Would you be willing to give it a try for a week?
PATIENT: A week… yes. A week doesn't sound too bad. I suppose I could write a few words. For a week. But if it doesn't help, I'm not doing it anymore. And you won't be mad if I forget sometimes? My memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Janeth. I completely understand, and I won't be mad at all. Life happens, and forgetting is perfectly normal. The important thing is that you're willing to try. And if it doesn't help after a week, we can explore other options. This is about finding what works for you. I’m going to give you a handout with some tips on keeping a mood journal. It also has a list of resources if you're interested in learning more about depression and other mental health conditions. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I suppose… I just hope this helps. It all sounds a bit silly, but I’m willing to try. Thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for not making me feel like I’m crazy. I'll try to write things down. For a week. Then we’ll see. Maybe.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. And you’re not silly at all. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health, and I commend you for taking this first step. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll check in again in a week to see how things are going. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good week, and take care of yourself.
