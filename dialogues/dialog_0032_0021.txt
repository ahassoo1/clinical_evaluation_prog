DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Ricky. It’s… well, my foot. It's been swelling up, and it's not getting any better. Feels kinda funny, too. Not painful painful, just…off. Been like this for maybe a week now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ricky. A week of foot swelling and a general “off” sensation. Can you describe the swelling a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's mostly on top of my foot, and around my ankle, I guess. It's not hard, if that makes sense? More… soft and puffy. Like if you squeezed it, it'd leave a dent. And it gets worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. I do a lot of walking for my job, you see. Interviewing people, showing 'em around… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I see. Soft, pitting edema, worse with ambulation. And you mentioned your job involves a considerable amount of walking. Is the swelling present first thing in the morning, or does it develop throughout the day?
PATIENT: It's not really there in the mornings. Maybe a little bit, but hardly noticeable. It builds up as the day goes on, for sure. Like I said, by the time I finish work, it's pretty obvious. I haven't been able to wear my good shoes for days now. Too tight, you know? Gotta wear these old comfy ones.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills. Not really any pain, like I said. Maybe a little ache sometimes, but nothing serious. My skin feels… warmer around it, maybe? And a little bit itchy, now that you mention it. It's hard to say if that’s just from being hot out, though. It's been a scorcher lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin?
PATIENT: Color changes… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little bit redder than usual, but it’s hard to tell with my skin tone, you know? I’m, well, I’m Somali, and we have… a different complexion. Not like turning blue or anything, just… a bit pinkish sometimes, maybe? Especially when it's warm. I'm not sure if that's related, though.
DOCTOR: I see. And to clarify, have you experienced any recent injury to your foot or ankle?
PATIENT: No, no injury. Nothing at all. I haven't twisted it, or dropped anything on it, or anything like that. It just… started swelling. Like I woke up one morning and it was a little puffy, and it's just gotten worse from there. I haven't been doing anything different, either. Same routine, same job, same everything. It’s a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination of your foot and ankle. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Anything to figure out what's going on. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your pulses are present, though slightly diminished on the affected side. I'm noting some tenderness to palpation over the dorsum of your foot, and your range of motion is slightly limited due to the swelling. There's no significant discoloration, as you mentioned. I am also noting some warmth to the touch. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. Never been diagnosed with anything, to be honest. My blood pressure's been a little high when the nurse checks it, but nothing they ever worried about. And no diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional painkiller if I get a headache, but that’s it. Oh, wait… I had a little trouble with my kidneys a few years back, but the doctor said it cleared up on its own. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of things, take most medicines… no problems at all. My wife used to be a nurse, and she always made sure I didn't have any hidden allergies. She was very careful about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ricky. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. However, given the gradual onset of swelling, the absence of significant pain, and your slightly diminished pulses, I suspect we may be dealing with a mild form of peripheral edema, potentially exacerbated by prolonged standing and ambulation. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a lipid panel. I also recommend a D-dimer to rule out deep vein thrombosis, just to be safe. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yeah, that sounds sensible. If it helps figure things out, then go ahead. A D-dimer… what's that for, exactly? I'm not very good with medical terms, you see.
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is a blood test that helps rule out blood clots in your leg – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s a precautionary measure, given the swelling. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have a clot, but it helps us determine if further imaging, such as an ultrasound, is necessary. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and kidney function. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels while we're at it. I will have the lab technician draw the samples now. Once the results are in, we can discuss them and formulate a more definitive plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood clots… that doesn’t sound good. But if it's just a precaution, then fine. I guess I'll go get the blood drawn. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Just through that door, to your left. The lab technician, Sarah, is expecting you. She’ll take care of everything. Once you’re finished, you can return here, and we’ll discuss next steps. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Just... hope it's nothing too serious, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Really, prolonged standing. Some people just don’t take care of themselves… .
