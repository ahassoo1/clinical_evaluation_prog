DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They just feel weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a terrible cold. I haven’t been able to do my tours like normal, and frankly, it’s a bit concerning. I’m Sharifa, by the way.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. It's nice to officially meet you as well. Weakness in your legs, starting a few days after a cold – I understand your concern. Can you describe the weakness for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to explain. It's not like a sudden paralysis or anything dramatic. It's just… when I try to walk for a long time, or even climb stairs, they feel like they're going to give out. Like jelly, almost. And it’s both legs, which is what’s really odd. I've never had anything like this before, and I need my legs for my job, you understand? I lead walking tours all over the city.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Sharifa. That sounds quite distressing, especially given your profession. “Like jelly,” you say. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. First thing in the morning, I feel… okay, not great, but functional. But by the afternoon, after I’ve been on my feet for a few hours with a tour group, it’s definitely worse. It's like they just… give out a little. Not a total collapse, thankfully, but enough that I have to really concentrate on walking. And I’ve noticed it’s worse if I’m tired, naturally. Though, truthfully, I’ve been a bit stressed lately too, with worrying about this. It’s impacting my livelihood, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that so thoroughly. It’s helpful to know it’s worse with activity and fatigue, and that stress seems to play a role. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No numbness, thankfully. And no pain, really. Though, my calves feel a bit tight sometimes, especially after walking. And I have been feeling a little more… clumsy than usual. Dropped my phone yesterday, which I never do. It’s just little things, honestly. Nothing major. Oh! And I’ve been feeling rather tired, even when I get enough sleep. But I chalked that up to worrying about my legs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That all makes perfect sense, Sharifa. No numbness or pain is good. The tightness in your calves and feeling clumsier are useful pieces of information. And the fatigue is certainly something we should consider. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, honestly, not much. I've always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was the extent of it. And I take a daily multivitamin, that’s about it. I've never been a big fan of doctors, if I’m being honest. I prefer to just… push through things. My mother always said it was best to let the body heal itself. Though, clearly, that isn’t working right now. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Sharifa. No major medical issues and just the gallbladder removal ten years ago. And you mentioned you take a daily multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to food, not to medication, nothing. I’ve always been very lucky that way. My ex-husband, on the other hand, was allergic to everything. It was a nightmare. Honestly, I’ve just been trying to rest and drink plenty of water, hoping it will just go away. But it’s been a week now, and it’s not improving. That’s why I finally came in. I suppose I’m a bit foolish for waiting this long.
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all, Sharifa. It’s good you’re here now. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. Though, I doubt you'll find anything. I told you, I'm usually perfectly healthy. I just have a feeling it’s stress. All this worrying is probably making it worse. But I suppose it doesn't hurt to check. Just… please be gentle. I've never been fond of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sharifa. I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your reflexes and some basic strength tests in your legs. Then I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Okay, Sharifa. Your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. I did notice some mild resistance with your strength testing, but nothing too concerning. It seems a bit diminished compared to what I’d expect, but not drastically so. I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Specifically, I want to check your Vitamin D levels, your electrolytes, and a complete blood count. It's also worth checking your thyroid function, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood tests… honestly, I was hoping to avoid that. But, alright. If you think it’s necessary, fine. But I really do think it's just stress. I've been very anxious lately. Between my ex-husband, my tours, and just… everything, it’s a lot to handle. What exactly will these tests show? And how long will it take to get the results? I have tours scheduled next week, you see. I can’t be laid up for long.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Sharifa. I want to reassure you that these tests are relatively routine and will give us a clearer picture of what might be going on. They'll help us rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your leg weakness. The Vitamin D test will check for a deficiency, which can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. Electrolytes are important for nerve and muscle function, and an imbalance can also cause similar symptoms. The complete blood count will check for anemia or any signs of infection. And the thyroid test will rule out any issues with your thyroid gland, which can also affect your energy levels and muscle strength. The lab should have the results back within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to rest when possible, staying hydrated, and trying to manage your stress levels. We can discuss some stress-reduction techniques if you’d like. Would you like me to write you a note excusing you from any strenuous activity for the next few days while we wait for the results?
PATIENT: A note would be… helpful, actually. Yes, please. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. And I really do appreciate you listening to me. Most doctors just dismiss me as being overly anxious. And… alright, yes, maybe I am a bit anxious. But it's for good reason! My livelihood depends on being able to walk, you understand? And… stress-reduction techniques? What did you have in mind? I’ve tried meditation, but I just can’t seem to quiet my mind. Honestly, sometimes I think it’s a lost cause. But, fine, I suppose I can try. If you have any suggestions, I’m willing to listen.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Sharifa. This note should excuse you from any physically demanding activities for the next 5 days. I understand your frustration. It's common to feel dismissed, especially when anxiety is involved. As for stress reduction, meditation isn’t for everyone. We could explore some deep breathing exercises, which can be very effective at calming the nervous system. There are also mindfulness techniques that focus on being present in the moment, rather than dwelling on worries. Sometimes even a short walk in nature – when you feel up to it – can be helpful. We can also discuss potential support groups or resources if you’d like. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting those blood tests done. Do you know where the lab is located?
PATIENT: I do, actually. It’s just down the street. I suppose I can go there later today. Though I hate needles, you understand. Absolutely despise them. But, alright, I suppose I have to do it. And… no, thank you to the support groups. I really don’t need to share my problems with strangers. Honestly, I prefer to keep things to myself. But the deep breathing exercises… alright, maybe I can try those. Do you have any simple ones I can start with? Nothing too complicated, please. I have a short attention span. And, just to be clear, if the blood tests are normal, what then? What will you do next? I don't want to be strung along with endless tests if it’s just my nerves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sharifa. I respect your preference for privacy. We absolutely won't push any support groups. As for the deep breathing, try this: Sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, counting to four. Hold it for a second, and then slowly exhale through your mouth, counting to six. Repeat this five to ten times. Focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. That’s all there is to it. If the blood tests come back normal, we would discuss other potential causes for your weakness. This could include things like nerve conduction studies to assess nerve function, or imaging studies to rule out any structural issues in your legs. However, if your symptoms improve with rest and stress reduction, we may simply monitor you closely and see how you do. We won’t proceed with endless tests without a clear reason. For now, let’s focus on the blood tests and seeing if those deep breathing exercises help. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… surprisingly patient with me, which I appreciate. I’ll go get those blood tests done, and I’ll try the breathing exercises. And if I start feeling worse, I’ll call. Alright, have a good day. And try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: You as well, Sharifa. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. And remember, even small steps can make a big difference.
