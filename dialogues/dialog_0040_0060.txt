DOCTOR: Right, Blain Theriot. 24 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's…family history, mostly. My mom’s side…a lot of heart problems. And her brother, he…didn’t make it to sixty. It’s just…I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Before it becomes a problem. I guess I just want some reassurance.
DOCTOR: Reassurance. Right. Look, everyone worries about family history. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to have the same problems. But it’s good you’re thinking about it. So, your mother…has she been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Yes, she has. High blood pressure, for years. And…something with her cholesterol. I don’t really…follow all the details. She goes to her own doctor, and I just…kind of assume she’s being taken care of. It’s more the sudden stuff, you know? Like her brother. He was perfectly healthy one day, and then…not. I'm not sure what happened exactly. It was a…a heart attack, I think. Though, honestly, nobody really talks about it.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure…cholesterol…and a brother with a heart attack. Vague history, but alright. So, you…are you experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the thing. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Maybe a little…tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I exercise a bit, try to eat okay… I just… I don’t want to wait until something is wrong, you know? It feels stupid, getting checked when I don’t feel sick, but…better safe than sorry, I guess. I just figured, if I get a baseline now, it’ll be easier to spot anything later. Though, honestly, I’m not even sure what a “baseline” is.
DOCTOR: A baseline is…good question. It's basically a snapshot of your health now. Blood pressure, cholesterol, maybe some other tests. So we have something to compare to if you do start feeling symptoms. Look, it's not stupid. It’s…proactive. Though honestly, a healthy 24-year-old…we usually don't spend this much time on it. But alright. Let’s start with the basics. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I eat everything. Though…I do get heartburn sometimes, if I eat something spicy. But that’s not an allergy, is it? More…a poor life choice, probably. And…I used to have asthma as a kid, but I haven't had an attack in years. Like, since I was ten. I don't even carry an inhaler anymore. I'm not sure if that matters.
DOCTOR: Asthma…childhood asthma. Okay. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I mean, unless I need them, obviously. But…no regular medication. Not even vitamins. I should probably be taking something, my mom keeps telling me, but…I just forget. Or I get busy. Or…it just doesn’t seem important when I feel okay. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s…not ideal. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a sense of things. Blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs…standard stuff. If you could just hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Though, honestly, I’m not sure what you’re even looking for. My heart is perfectly fine, I’m pretty sure. I exercise. I don’t smoke. I don’t…do anything that would be bad for it. I just…worry. It's a habit, I guess. A bad one. Just…try not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is…normal. A little fast, perhaps, but you said you exercise. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is…128 over 76. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems…within normal limits. For now. But your blood pressure is something we'll keep an eye on. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Uh…not that I know of. My grandmother on my dad’s side…she was…sick, for a long time. But I don’t think it was diabetes. Something with her kidneys, maybe? Nobody really talked about it. It was a long time ago. My mom’s side…no, I don’t think so. They all just…had heart problems. It's always the heart. Honestly, it’s probably just genetics. Bad luck, I guess. Can I sit up now? This table is cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sit up. Look, you’re young and generally healthy. We’ve established that. But that slightly elevated blood pressure…and the family history…I think we should run a basic lipid panel. Cholesterol, triglycerides…see where things stand. And a complete blood count, just to be thorough. I’ll order them now. You can get it done at the lab down the hall. I’m not going to put you on any medication at this point. But we need a baseline. It's just…responsible medicine. Any questions?
PATIENT: Responsible medicine…right. So…just blood work? Nothing else? No…fancy tests? Like, a stress test or something? Just to be sure? And…how long will it take to get the results? I have a pretty busy schedule, you know. I don’t want to have to keep coming back. Honestly, this is all a little…anticlimactic. I thought there would be more…doing. Less…waiting.
DOCTOR: A stress test is…unnecessary at this point. You’re not exhibiting any symptoms that warrant one. And frankly, we have more pressing things to rule out. The blood work should be back in a few days. The lab will email you the results, and then you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. Here. Take this to the lab. And don’t worry, it’s just a standard blood draw. It won’t take long. Honestly, sometimes the best medicine is preventative. It’s about being proactive. And frankly, a little waiting is a small price to pay for peace of mind. Any further questions?
PATIENT: Peace of mind…right. I guess. It's just…I was expecting something more. Something…definitive. But fine. Blood work. I’ll get it done. When I have time. Honestly, it just feels like a waste of time. But my mom would kill me if I didn't. Okay. I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll see you…when the results are back. Or not. Depending on what they say. .
