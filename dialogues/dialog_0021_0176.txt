DOCTOR: Right. Well, hello there. Ivette, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ivette Redeye. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Havird, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Just Jumana is fine. Though frankly, I’ve seen a lot of patients, so names…they don’t always stick. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re…persistent, to say the least. It's been over 48 hours now, I think. It's really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. And it’s not just little ones, either. Some of them are quite…forceful. It's making it hard to concentrate, and I manage a little entertainment venue, so that's…important.
DOCTOR: An entertainment venue?
PATIENT: Yes, a small one. I run a sort of…cabaret and games place. A bit of everything, really. We have singers, a few magicians, and some board games for the tourists. It’s not fancy, but it keeps me busy. And the hiccups are not helping with managing it, let me tell you. Especially when I’m trying to talk to performers!
DOCTOR: Right. So, these forceful hiccups… have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, have I! Everything people told me. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, sugar, vinegar… even getting someone to scare me. Nothing seems to work. It’s…frustrating, to say the least. I even tried that lemon trick with the salt, but that just made me cough.
DOCTOR: People and their home remedies. Honestly. Alright, let’s just get some basics down. Any other medical problems you have?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all straightforward, and I've been fine since. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious, Doctor… Jumana. Oh, and I don't have any insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder, alright. Insurance... it always matters. Any medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I try to avoid them if I can. Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Really. Just the hiccups, and they're driving me mad! It feels like something’s stuck, almost. Though I know that's probably not possible.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say?
PATIENT: Well, not literally stuck, of course. It's just a feeling. A sort of…tightness in my chest when I get one, and then a sort of…pressure afterwards. It’s hard to describe. It's just uncomfortable, and makes me jump with every hiccup. There! See? It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your chest. Just to rule things out. If you could just sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And be warned, I might hiccup while you listen! It’s very…uncooperative.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… Good. Sounds clear. Nothing obvious. A bit of normal wheezing, which is to be expected. Chest is symmetrical, no tenderness to palpation. Alright. Anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No, that’s really it. Just these awful hiccups. They started right after I helped a friend move some very heavy boxes, actually. But I didn’t think it could be related…I mean, it's been two days! It just feels…odd, that something so simple could be so persistent. And I have a show to run!
DOCTOR: Heavy boxes, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very heavy ones. Antique furniture, mostly. My friend's husband wasn’t feeling well, and she was desperate for help. I'm fairly strong, I’ve always been able to lift things, but we were moving them up a flight of stairs. It was quite strenuous, now that I think about it. Could that have…somehow triggered this? Do you think that’s possible?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Though unlikely. Sometimes…the body just does odd things. Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Everything feels perfectly normal, apart from the hiccups, of course! No pain, no weakness, no funny sensations. Just…hiccups. A lot of them. And the feeling of a tight chest afterwards. It’s very…consistent, actually. Every time I hiccup, I get that tightness. See? There! It's quite annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just run some basic bloodwork, rule out anything…serious. And perhaps an EKG, just to be safe. You said no insurance, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, no insurance. Will that be very expensive? I mean, I can manage, but I'm a bit worried about the cost now. I’m already losing money with me having to cover shifts because of this…
DOCTOR: It will be… something. We can discuss it with the billing department. Let’s get the tests done first. It's better to rule things out, even if it's just… stubborn hiccups. Nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. Don't eat or drink anything for two hours beforehand. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No food or drink for two hours. That’s fine. Thank you, Doctor Jumana. I appreciate you looking into this. Hopefully, it is just stubborn hiccups, and we can get them sorted out quickly. I really need to get back to running my show.
DOCTOR: We’ll see. Nurse will be with you shortly. And try not to worry too much. Though frankly, running a "show" sounds exhausting. .
PATIENT: .
