DOCTOR: Hi Velda, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line requires some medical information before I travel. A form, you see. They want it filled out by my doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. A pre-travel form. Let me pull up your chart… Velda Squiers, age 45. And you said this is for a cruise next month?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Leaving September the tenth, if that’s any help. It’s a small one, just around the Mediterranean. I’ve always wanted to see Italy, you see. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a good while. I keep myself quite fit, generally.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely! Italy is beautiful. And that's good you're generally fit. Still, the cruise line is right to be thorough. Let’s just go through a bit of your medical history to get everything documented for the form. First, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses…let me see. Nothing major, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was about twenty, but I recovered fully. Oh! And a broken wrist, years ago, when I tripped over a garden gnome. A silly thing, really. But no serious illnesses, no. Not that I recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, pneumonia around age twenty, and a fractured wrist. I’ll make a note of those. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…that’s a bit difficult. My mother passed away several years ago, and she wasn’t one for sharing much about her health. My father…well, he wasn’t around much. I don’t recall any serious illnesses on either side, to be honest. My auntie Agnes had high blood pressure, I believe, but she lived to a good age. Is that important? I’m not very good with these things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Velda. It’s common not to have all the details. High blood pressure is good to know, thank you. We'll note that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take any medicine…well, within reason, of course. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her baking, and she used all sorts of things – nuts, fruit, everything. And I’ve never had any trouble. I suppose I’m quite fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: That is fortunate! No known allergies. Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing at all. I take a vitamin D tablet in the winter, just because it’s often cloudy here, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. I believe in a good diet and fresh air, you see. And a bit of exercise, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamin D occasionally. Good to know. Alright, Velda, that gives me a good start. Now, just to be thorough, and since you haven't been to a doctor in a while, could you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling generally lately?
PATIENT: Generally? Well, I feel quite well, actually. I’m a bit…tired sometimes, perhaps. But that’s just age, I suppose. And the garden keeps me busy, you see. A bit of aches and pains now and then, nothing serious. I sleep well enough, and my appetite is good. I’ve no complaints, really. Just a bit…weary at times. Is that normal? I don’t want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Velda. A bit of fatigue and some aches and pains – nothing alarming, but good to mention. When you say fatigue, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I’d say. Some days I feel perfectly fine, full of energy. And other days…well, I just feel a bit…flat. Not ill, just lacking my usual pep. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, you understand. I still manage the garden and everything. But it’s there, a bit of a shadow, if you like. Especially in the afternoons, I think. It’s probably just the weather. We’ve had a lot of rain lately.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. And do you notice any other symptoms that seem to come and go with that fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me see…sometimes I get a bit of a headache, a dull ache at the back of my head. And my digestion isn’t always as good as it used to be. A bit of…indigestion, perhaps. Nothing serious, just a bit uncomfortable. And…oh! I sometimes feel a bit…dizzy, when I stand up quickly. It passes quickly, but it’s there. Do those things mean anything, Doctor? I’m not wanting to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, some digestive issues, and occasional dizziness upon standing. Those are all things we want to note, Velda. It’s good you’re telling me everything. To get a better picture, could you describe those headaches a little more?
PATIENT: They’re not sharp, you understand. Not like a migraine. Just a dull ache, starting at the back of my head and spreading around. It’s not crippling, just…annoying. It doesn't come with any sickness, or anything like that. It’s just…present. And it’s worse when I’m tired, I think. Or if the weather is bad. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a bad headache, just…there. A nagging sort of ache.
DOCTOR: A nagging ache, worse with fatigue and bad weather. Okay. And the dizziness – does that happen every time you stand up, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Just sometimes, when I stand up quickly. It’s only for a moment, you see. A bit of a wooziness, and then it passes. I don’t fall, or anything like that. I just need to hold onto something for a moment. It’s not frequent, thankfully. It’s probably just my age, isn’t it? I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Velda. We'll get to the bottom of it. Just to be thorough, let me ask a few quick questions about other parts of your body. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision…let me see. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I still read quite happily, and I can see the garden clearly enough. Perhaps it’s not as sharp as it used to be, but that’s just age, isn’t it? I haven’t had any blurry vision, or anything like that. Just a bit…dim, perhaps. But I’ve always needed good light to read, even when I was younger. No sudden changes, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sudden changes in vision, just some general dimness. Good. And how about your hearing?
PATIENT: My hearing…well, my husband used to say I could hear a pin drop. He was a bit of a tease, you see. I don’t think it’s changed much, no. I still hear the birds singing in the garden, and I can hear the television perfectly well. Perhaps I need to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, but that’s just because they mumble, isn’t it? No, I don’t think my hearing has changed much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just a couple more quick questions. Have you noticed any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My weight has been pretty stable, as far as I can tell. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, you understand. But my clothes still fit the same, and I haven’t been eating any differently. Perhaps I’ve lost a tiny bit, now that I think about it, but nothing significant. Just the usual fluctuations, I suppose. I eat a good, balanced diet, you see. Nothing fancy, but good, wholesome food.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh…well. That’s a bit…personal, isn’t it? Everything is…regular, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a bit…slower, now that I think about it. But nothing serious, thankfully. Just the usual…changes that come with age, I suppose. I eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, you see. Keeps everything…moving, as they say. I apologize for being so vague. It's not a comfortable topic.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Velda. It is a bit personal, and you’ve been very open with me. Okay, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just please be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be, you see. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes are intact. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything sounds and looks normal so far, Velda. Now, I'm going to order some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. It will include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. It'll also be helpful to check your Vitamin D level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…thorough. Blood work seems sensible. Vitamin D is a good idea, I suppose, given the amount of rain we’ve had. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Are there any risks to having blood taken? I’ve always been a bit…faint-hearted, you see. But I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. What will the results tell us?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to be a bit apprehensive. The risks are minimal, Velda. Usually just a little discomfort at the injection site, and sometimes a small bruise. We'll have a nurse take the blood, and they're very good at making it as comfortable as possible. As for what the results will tell us, the complete blood count will check for things like anemia or infection. The basic metabolic panel will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And the thyroid panel will help us rule out any thyroid problems. The Vitamin D level will just confirm if you're deficient. It will give us a better understanding of the fatigue and other symptoms you've been experiencing. It will take a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just one thing…will the results tell me if it’s just…old age? I don’t want to make a fuss over nothing, you see. But it’s good to know, isn't it? And…where will the nurse take the blood? Is it a comfortable room? I apologize for being so…difficult. I just don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Velda, and you're not being difficult at all. The results may show changes consistent with aging, which is normal. But we want to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms first. The nurse will take the blood in a private room, and it’s very comfortable. It’s a quiet space, and they'll make sure you're as relaxed as possible. They're very experienced with patients who are anxious about needles. You can also let them know, and they can use techniques to minimize discomfort. They can even use a numbing cream if you'd like. Would you like me to have them contact you directly to schedule the appointment?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be wonderful. Having them contact me directly would be…less stressful, I think. And a numbing cream sounds…very sensible, thank you. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Anything I should avoid eating, or drinking? I don’t want to…mess up the results, you see. And…thank you again. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I'm glad I could help. You don't need to do anything special before the blood work, just try to be well-hydrated. Fasting is not required for these tests. The nurse will give you specific instructions when they contact you. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I'll have them reach out tomorrow to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
