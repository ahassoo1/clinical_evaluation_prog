DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see... what brings me in... Well, it’s a bit of a worry, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps after me to come. She’s concerned about… well, about things happening. Little spells, you could call them. And my family… there’s been a history, you know? Headaches, mostly. And… weakness. It’s hard to explain. It all feels a bit foggy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Tofani. It sounds understandably concerning when you're experiencing these spells and have a family history to consider. It's good your daughter is encouraging you to get it checked out. When you say "spells," could you describe what those are like?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, she’s a good girl, my Maria. Always looking out for me. The spells… well, it’s not like I fall down or anything dramatic. It’s more like… a heaviness. On one side, usually. My right side. My arm feels… clumsy. And sometimes my leg. It doesn’t last long, just a few minutes, maybe. And then it’s gone. But it’s… unsettling. And with the headaches… they’re not always there, but when they come, they’re pretty strong. Like a band tightening around my head. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Tofani. A heaviness on one side, clumsiness, and headaches… those are important details. And the fact that it comes and goes is also helpful information. Just to clarify, when you say it happens on your right side, is that always the right side, or does it ever switch?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I think it’s always the right side. Now that you mention it, I can’t recall it ever being the left. Though… honestly, with my memory these days, I can’t be certain. It’s been happening… well, not often, but enough to worry Maria. A few times in the last few months, I’d say. Not every week, but… enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Ms. Tofani. It's understandable that memory can be a bit tricky, and that's perfectly alright. The fact that it consistently affects the right side is a significant detail. You mentioned this has been happening for a few months. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these spells – anything that happens right before they start?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… that’s a good question too. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific. I mean, I’ve had them when I’m resting, when I’m doing housework, even when I’m just sitting and watching television. It just… comes on. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy beforehand, maybe? But not always. And sometimes there’s no warning at all. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers and sometimes a little dizziness beforehand. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every day. And… arthritis, in my hands. It’s not too bad, mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings. Other than that… I don’t think so. I had the flu a couple of times, of course, and a bad cold last winter. But nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure and arthritis. What medication are you taking for your high blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking something difficult. Let me see… it’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an ‘L’… Lisinopril? Is that right? Yes, I think that’s it. Lisinopril. And for the arthritis, just some over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril for your blood pressure. And over-the-counter pain relievers for your arthritis, that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my gallbladder out many years ago. That must have been… oh, goodness… forty years ago, maybe more? It was a pretty simple surgery, nothing too serious. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist, a long time ago too. Just a simple fracture, I think. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. Gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture in the past. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That’s a long story. My mother, bless her soul, she had terrible headaches all her life. Migraines, the doctor called them. She was always in bed with them, poor thing. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years back. He’s doing okay now, but it was frightening. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she had something with her… her balance. She used to stumble and fall a lot. That’s why Maria is so worried, I think. She says it could be… inherited, or something.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. A family history of migraines, stroke, and balance issues… that’s helpful information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medications. I’ve taken a few different things over the years, for colds and flu and such, and never had any trouble. I don’t have any skin allergies either. No, I don’t think I have any allergies at all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Tofani. No known allergies. Now, just to get a better picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink of alcohol in… oh, goodness, decades! Not since my wedding, I think. And certainly no drugs! I’m a very simple woman, Doctor. Just tea and a little bit of biscotti now and then.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for sharing that. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. You’re the doctor, after all. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and make Maria feel a little less worried. So yes, please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your strength and balance. Could you please hold out your arms?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I’m not as strong as I used to be, you know. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that strong enough? It’s a bit difficult, you know. My hands aren’t what they used to be with the arthritis.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, if you don’t mind, could you close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright… I’m closed. It feels a bit strange…
DOCTOR: Okay… good. Just remain still for a moment. Alright, you can open your eyes now. Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That was very helpful. Based on the examination, your strength is slightly diminished, but overall normal. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance is relatively stable, though a little bit of sway is present. This is not uncommon for someone your age. However, I am noting some subtle asymmetry when testing your strength. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a few tests. I'm thinking a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… An MRI… that sounds a bit serious. Is something wrong, Doctor? I mean, you’re not saying… is it something bad? I just want to know what’s going on, you know. And I want Maria to stop worrying. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose. But I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Tofani. It's natural to feel anxious when we're talking about tests, especially an MRI. I'm not saying it is something bad, not at all. An MRI is simply a tool that allows us to get a more detailed look at your brain. It helps us rule out potential causes for your symptoms, such as a stroke, a tumor, or other structural problems. Given your family history of stroke and the subtle asymmetry I detected during the examination, it's the most prudent course of action. It's better to be thorough and rule things out, rather than simply hope for the best. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and MRI right now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the imaging center will schedule the MRI. In the meantime, I'd like to discuss some potential causes for your symptoms, while we await the test results. It's possible you could be experiencing a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, which is sometimes called a mini-stroke. It's also possible that you could be experiencing migraine with aura, given your family history. Other possibilities include vertigo or even just age-related changes in the brain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a mini-stroke… that is frightening. My brother… he had a stroke, you said? Is that what you mean? And vertigo… that sounds awful too. Everything spinning around… It’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. And I don’t want to worry Maria. So… you’re saying it could be a lot of things? And we have to wait for the tests to find out?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Tofani, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed right now. It's good you have Maria looking out for you. Yes, you're right, it could be a number of things, and we need the test results to help us narrow down the possibilities. A stroke, even a TIA, is certainly something we need to rule out. Vertigo is another possibility, as is migraine. There are other, less serious possibilities as well. To be clear, I'm not saying you have a stroke. I'm simply explaining why I'm ordering these tests. It's important to be thorough and investigate all potential causes. While we await the results, I recommend you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I will also prescribe a medication to help prevent future strokes, just as a precautionary measure. It's called aspirin. It helps thin the blood and reduce the risk of clot formation. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Aspirin… I’ve heard of that. For your heart, right? No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I think… I think I just need to sit with this for a bit. And call Maria. She’ll want to know everything. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not… for not scaring me too much. I appreciate that. What happens after the tests? Will you call me with the results? Or will I have to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It’s my pleasure to help. I understand needing to sit with this, and certainly call Maria. After the tests, the imaging center and lab will send the results to me directly. I will review them carefully and then contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings in detail. I will explain everything clearly and answer any questions you may have. I will also provide you with a written summary of the results and a plan of action, depending on what the tests show. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about how to schedule the tests, or anything else before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll call Maria now, and then I’ll try to relax. It’s… it’s a lot to take in. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
