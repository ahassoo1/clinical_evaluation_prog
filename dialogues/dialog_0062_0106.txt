DOCTOR: Hi Louine, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A bad one. And honestly, I don’t understand why it won’t heal. I’ve tried things, you know. Things my mother used to do. But nothing seems to work anymore. Young people don’t know the old ways, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a troublesome sore on your foot that isn't healing. I understand. It's good you've been trying things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Sometimes the old ways are the best, but sometimes we need to add a little modern medicine to help. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the sore itself?
PATIENT: Modern medicine… hmph. Well, it's on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. It started as just a little red spot, I suppose. I didn't think much of it at first. But it got bigger, and now it's…well, it's open. And it hurts, especially when I try to walk. It’s always a little damp, too. Disgusting, really. I keep it covered, of course, but still. It’s just…not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's on the bottom of your foot near your heel, started as a small red spot and has gotten bigger and is now open and painful, especially with walking. And you've noticed it's often damp. That does sound unpleasant. Do you remember when this first started, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must have been… February, I believe. Yes, February. Right after my grandson visited from the mainland. He brought a terrible cold, and I was fussing over him, making sure he was comfortable. I suppose I was on my feet a lot then. And I remember thinking my shoes felt a bit tight after that visit. Not that those shoes are the problem! They were good leather.
DOCTOR: Okay, February… so it’s been about six months now. And it sounds like it may have started around the time your grandson was visiting and you were on your feet a lot. That’s helpful. You mentioned your shoes felt a bit tight afterwards. Do you wear those same shoes often?
PATIENT: Well, I used to. They’re very comfortable, once they’re broken in. But now…now I mostly wear slippers around the house. Or, when I have to go out, I wear those…those stretchy things. The ones with the holes. Not very dignified, but they don't rub. And honestly, my feet have changed, you know? They aren't what they used to be. Everything sags eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been trying to accommodate the soreness by changing your footwear. And you’re right, feet do change over time. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… my legs ache sometimes. A lot. Especially at night. And I get very thirsty. Always thirsty. And I’ve been…going to the bathroom more often, if you understand. It’s just…old age, I suppose. Though my mother always said a lot of thirst and frequent bathroom trips wasn’t a good sign, but she worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed aching legs, particularly at night, increased thirst, and more frequent bathroom trips. It’s good you're aware of these changes, and you're right to mention them. Your mother was wise to be cautious. I’m going to ask a few more questions, and then I’d like to take a look at your foot. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to get a little rash from poison ivy when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. And I can’t stand penicillin, makes me feel quite ill. But other than that, no. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, you know. Tonics and teas and…well, everything. A little of this, a little of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known drug allergies besides penicillin. And you’ve had a bit of experience with different remedies over the years. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because the sun isn’t very strong. And sometimes, when my legs really ache, I take ibuprofen. Just a couple, you know. Nothing fancy. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it a while back. Said my numbers were good.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D in the winter, ibuprofen for leg aches as needed, and you were previously on blood pressure medication but it was discontinued. That’s helpful. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your foot?
PATIENT: Go ahead. It’s not a pretty sight, I warn you. And try not to make a face. I hate it when people make faces. It makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I see the sore. It looks a bit inflamed, and there is some redness around the edges. It’s about…approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, and it appears to be quite deep. There is some warmth to the area, and it is tender to the touch. I'm also going to check your pulses in your feet and legs to make sure circulation is good. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than I'd like. Do you have any diabetes, or a history of poor circulation?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, yes. The doctor told me years ago. Type 2, he said. I try to watch what I eat, but it’s hard. So many tempting things! And my mother… she had it too. She lost a toe, you know. That scared me something awful. And poor circulation…well, he mentioned that as well. Said it was something I needed to be careful about. That’s why I try to keep moving, even when it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of Type 2 diabetes and have been told about poor circulation. That’s very important information. And you’re right to be concerned about that, given your mother’s experience. It's good you're trying to stay active despite the pain. Given your history of diabetes and the appearance of this sore, I'm concerned about a possible foot ulcer. Ulcers can be slow to heal, and they can get infected if not properly managed. I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I want to check your blood sugar levels, and I'd like to do a wound culture to see if there’s an infection present. I will also order a vascular study to check the blood flow to your foot. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly, I feel like all I do is go to doctors and get poked and prodded. But… I suppose it’s better than losing a toe. So, no, I don’t suppose I have any questions. Just…how long will all this take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. It is a lot, and I wish we could just know what’s going on without having to do so many tests. But these will give us the information we need to get you the right treatment. The blood work will only take a few minutes, just a small prick in your finger. The wound culture will involve gently cleaning the sore and taking a small swab. It shouldn’t be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable for a moment. The vascular study will involve placing some sensors on your legs and feet - it's non-invasive and shouldn’t hurt at all. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll discuss a plan to get this sore healed and prevent it from happening again. In the meantime, it’s very important that you keep the sore clean and dry, and avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible. Do you have someone who can help you with that?
PATIENT: My grandson, Kaimana, comes by sometimes. He's a good boy, tries to help. But he's always busy with his work. And I hate being a bother. I mostly manage on my own. I have those special bandages, you know. The ones that foam. They’re supposed to keep it clean. But they get expensive, and they don't always work. And…I don’t want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. You're very resilient, managing on your own like this. It’s good you have Kaimana to help when he can, but it’s important not to hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Losing your foot is absolutely not what we want, and that’s why we’re doing these tests. We’re going to do everything we can to get this sore healed and prevent complications. In the meantime, let’s focus on keeping it clean and protected. Those foam bandages are a good start. I'm going to write you a prescription for a special type of dressing that will help keep the wound moist and promote healing. I'll also give you instructions on how to care for it properly. I'll also have the nurse come by to help you get set up with some resources to help you manage this at home, and we can discuss if a referral to a podiatrist would be helpful. They specialize in foot care and can provide extra support. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That…that sounds alright, I suppose. A special dressing… and someone to help. That would be good. I do get tired, you know. And it's hard to bend over. I'm just… I just want this to be over with. And I don’t want to be a burden. One more thing…will it interfere with my bingo night? I can't miss bingo night.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Louine. It’s okay to want things to get back to normal, and it’s absolutely okay to want to keep going to bingo night. We’ll do everything we can to make that happen. The special dressing should help the wound heal faster, and we can discuss ways to protect your foot while you're at bingo. Perhaps a comfortable, supportive shoe, or taking breaks to elevate your foot. We'll also talk about signs of infection to watch out for. If you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus, you need to call me right away. I'm going to write everything down for you, including the dressing prescription, instructions for wound care, and a list of warning signs. The nurse will also go over everything with you. Let's focus on getting this sore healed one step at a time, and we’ll do our best to keep you enjoying your bingo nights. Now, do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. Most doctors just rush you through and don’t listen. But you…you seem to care. I suppose…I suppose I’ll see you later then. And thank you, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. It’s my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. My goal is to get you feeling better and back to enjoying the things you love. I'll have the nurse come in to review everything with you and get you set up with the prescription and resources. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
