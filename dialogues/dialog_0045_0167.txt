DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my foot... it’s been bothering me something awful. It’s a sore, a bad one. Been there a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. A sore on your foot, you said. How long exactly has this sore been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time... time gets away from an old man, you know? I think... maybe three, four months now? It started small, just a little red spot. Didn’t think much of it at first. But it got bigger, and now it hurts to walk. A lot.
DOCTOR: Three or four months... okay. And where on your foot is this sore located exactly?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right… near my big toe. Hard to see myself, you know? But that's where it is. It feels like it’s deep inside, not just on the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, bottom of the foot, near the big toe, and you feel it's deep... Is it constantly painful, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I walk, Doctor. When I'm just sitting, it’s not so bad. But as soon as I stand up and try to take a few steps… ooh, it really hurts. And it seems to get worse towards the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Worsening with activity and at the end of the day... Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus draining from the sore?
PATIENT: Well, it is red, Doctor. Always has been. And sometimes… sometimes it feels a little warm to the touch. I haven't seen any… what was that word?… pus coming out of it, no. Just red and warm. And sore, very sore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Redness and warmth... Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: I put some bandages on it, Doctor. And I tried some ointment, you know, the kind you put on cuts. But it didn’t seem to help much. That’s why I came to see you. I figured it needed more than just a bandage.
DOCTOR: Okay, bandages and ointment without much relief. Do you have diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I do. Been having it for… well, a long time now. The doctor told me to watch my feet, that's why I came in. I remember him saying something about sores and… trouble. That’s what I was worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes… that's important. And you're right to be concerned. Let's take a look at the foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Just give me a moment… old bones aren’t as quick as they used to be. There you go. Be careful, it might not be pretty.
DOCTOR: Hmm... yes, I see the sore. It’s located on the plantar surface, near the metatarsal head of the first toe. There's a fair amount of surrounding redness and some induration. It's approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter. I don't see any active drainage at the moment, but the skin is quite warm to the touch. Palpation is tender to pressure. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but a little weak. Posterior tibial pulse is also present, but faint. Capillary refill is a bit delayed, around 3 seconds. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. This is concerning. Given your diabetes and the characteristics of the sore, it’s likely a diabetic foot ulcer. We need to prevent this from getting worse.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… ulcer? That doesn't sound good at all. What does that mean, Doctor? Will I… will I lose my foot? I’m a bit scared now. I need to walk, you know? I like to go to the store… and visit my friends.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, let’s not jump to conclusions. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll lose your foot. But diabetic foot ulcers can be serious if left untreated, which is why we're addressing this now. It means the skin has broken down due to poor circulation and nerve damage from the diabetes. We need to keep it clean, protected, and get your blood sugar under better control. I’m going to order some blood work to check your glucose levels and look for any signs of infection. I’m also going to get an X-ray to see if the infection has spread to the bone. We’ll also need to offload pressure from the area. I’m going to recommend a referral to a podiatrist, they specialize in foot care and will be best equipped to debride the wound and provide specialized wound care. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds alright. Blood work and… de-bride? What does that mean? And a podiatrist… is that a special kind of doctor for feet? I just want to get better. I don’t want any trouble. I trust you to do what’s best. Just explain it to me slowly, okay? My old brain doesn't work so fast anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Stoegbauer. Absolutely. Let’s take it slow. “Debridement” simply means removing any dead or infected tissue from the wound. Think of it like cleaning up a bad spot to allow the good tissue to heal. The podiatrist will do this very carefully. And yes, a podiatrist is a special kind of doctor who focuses specifically on the feet. They’re experts in treating conditions like diabetic foot ulcers. They will work with me to develop a plan to get this wound healed. We'll also need to focus on controlling your blood sugar. High blood sugar slows down healing and makes you more susceptible to infection. I’m going to review your medications and see if any adjustments need to be made. For now, I want you to keep all weight off of that foot as much as possible. I'll give you a special boot to wear and instructions on how to care for the wound. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few days to review the blood work and X-ray results and discuss the podiatrist referral. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds very good. A special boot… and keep weight off… I can do that. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I’ll see the… podiatrist… as soon as possible. I just want to get back to walking. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. That's my job. We’ll work together on this. I’m going to have the nurse come in and get you set up with the boot and some wound care supplies. She'll also give you detailed instructions and a handout to take home. She will also schedule your podiatrist appointment. I’ll see you back here in a few days. In the meantime, if you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. You are a very kind doctor. I’ll see you soon. .
