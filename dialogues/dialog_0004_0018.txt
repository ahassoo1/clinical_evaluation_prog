DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I seem to be going to the restroom… a great deal. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, I believe. Though pinpointing when it started… that escapes me.
DOCTOR: A great deal, you say. And when you say 'a great deal,' can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me see. It used to be, perhaps, four or five times a day. Normal, I always thought. Now… well, now it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more. Especially at night, which is… disruptive. It’s difficult to get a proper rest, you understand. And the volume… is greater than it once was, I suppose. I don’t really measure, you see. It’s just… noticeable. I hope that clarifies things, Doctor. Though my recollection isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Disruptive sleep is never good. Alright, Mr. Verbos. So, increased frequency and volume. Any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet… now that's a good question. I don't believe so, not intentionally. I tend to eat… rather predictably. Mostly soups, I suppose. And bread. Occasionally, a bit of fish. Nothing particularly… diuretic, as I understand the term. Though I may have had a few more cucumbers than usual these past weeks. If that makes any difference? I really couldn't say. I leave most of the shopping to… well, never mind. It's just me, you see.
DOCTOR: Cucumbers, noted. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. There's a slight discomfort, perhaps, a little stinging sometimes. But it’s not severe. Barely noticeable, truthfully. It doesn't keep me from going, if that makes sense. It’s just… not entirely comfortable. And it’s not with every instance, Doctor. Just occasionally. I hope that’s clear enough. It's difficult to articulate these things precisely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. Now you're asking a question. I suppose… it’s been paler than usual. Very pale. Almost… translucent, at times. I hadn’t really given it much thought, to be honest. I just assumed it was the… cucumbers. They have a high water content, don't they? I'm starting to feel rather foolish, dwelling on such details. Is this normal, Doctor? Should I be concerned?
DOCTOR: Pale urine can be due to increased fluid intake, yes. But given the frequency and nocturnal disturbances… we need to rule other things out. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. I feel perfectly well, other than this… inconvenience. Chills, no. And lower back pain… occasionally, a little stiffness in the mornings. But that’s just my age, I suspect. It’s not sharp, or persistent. Just… old age creeping in, I always figure. I haven't taken my temperature, if that's what you mean. I rarely bother with such things. Is this a serious matter, Doctor? You're starting to make me anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I'm not trying to cause anxiety, but it's my job to be thorough. Let’s do a quick physical exam and then I’d like to order a urinalysis, just to be certain. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A urinalysis sounds… sensible. I’m happy to cooperate with whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement. Though I must say, I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell, aside from this frequent need to… relieve myself. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. 141 pounds. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and then do a quick prostate exam. It’s standard procedure given your symptoms. Please lie down on the exam table.
PATIENT: A prostate exam… I see. I understand it’s standard, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’ve never had one before. I trust you’ll be… gentle? I’m a bit of a… delicate constitution, you see. And I'm rather self-conscious, if I may be so frank.
DOCTOR: It will be quick and as comfortable as possible, Mr. Verbos. Just relax. Prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but no immediate concerns. No nodules or significant tenderness. Alright. Now, let's get that urinalysis sample. I’ll leave you some privacy. There are instructions in the bathroom.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? I confess, I’m rather anxious now. Very well, Doctor. A urinalysis, then. I shall endeavor to… comply. I trust the instructions are clear? I’m not particularly adept at such procedures, you see. And… I apologize in advance if I take a bit of time. .
DOCTOR: The instructions are straightforward, Mr. Verbos. I'll be just outside when you're finished. Don't rush.
