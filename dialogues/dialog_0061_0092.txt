DOCTOR: Bula and good afternoon, Mr. Guilds. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Dr. Kim, you say? Well, I dunno... the breathing. It’s been… hard. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes... scratchy. Real scratchy. I ain’t been feelin’ so good lately. It’s just… gettin’ worse, I think. Don’t remember when it started started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’ve been having some trouble with your breathing, and you’re feeling dry and scratchy. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it feels like it might just be old age. We'll figure it out together. Let’s start with the breathing. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? Hmm. Well… it’s like… tryin’ to suck air through a straw, but the straw’s got a kink in it. You know? Not painful, exactly. Just… work. Especially when I walk. Used to be able to walk anywhere. Now… not so much. I get… winded. Real quick. And this dry mouth… it’s awful. Gotta drink water constantly. What’s that got to do with the breathin’, though? Seem kinda separate, don’t ya think?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like working hard to breathe, especially with activity, and it makes you get winded quickly. And the dry mouth is a separate issue, you think?
PATIENT: Separate? Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know what knows what anymore. Everything feels… off. I used to work with traffic lights, you know? Fixin’ 'em. Had to climb those poles… never had this trouble then. Strong as an ox, I was! Now… look at me. All… wheezy. It's probably just old age, like I said. But my niece, she kept tellin' me to come see someone. Said I was lookin' pale. Women… always worryin’.
DOCTOR: It's good your niece encouraged you to come in. Pale skin can be a sign of something going on, and it's always best to check these things out. You mentioned working with traffic lights – that was physical work, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, real physical. Climbin’ poles, liftin’ stuff… hot sun, cold rain. All sorts of weather. Did that for… oh, I don't know… thirty years, maybe more? Now I mostly sit. Watch TV. Worry. It’s a bad job for a man, sittin' around. Makes you soft. And the breathin’ gets worse when I try to do anything! Even walkin' to the mailbox, sometimes. It’s… frustrating. Used to be a doer. Now I’m just… a watcher. And a wheezer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the breathing gets worse with any exertion, even simple things like walking to the mailbox. And you've been very active in the past, with a physically demanding job for thirty years. Let's talk a little bit more about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. That's a tough one. Doctors… I ain't seen many doctors. Went to the company doctor now and then when I busted a knee or somethin’. But… diagnosed? Not that I remember. Never had heart trouble. Never smoked, never drank much. Diabetes… maybe? My mom had somethin’ like that, I think. She always had to watch what she ate. But me… I liked my Cuban coffee with plenty of sugar. Medicare covers somethin', right? I get confused with all the papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major diagnoses that you recall, and you’ve generally been healthy aside from occasional injuries. Your mother had something like diabetes. And you enjoy Cuban coffee with sugar. That’s helpful to know. And yes, Medicare will cover what we need to do today. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Nope. Don't take nothin’ regular. Maybe a pain reliever for my arthritis sometimes, but that's it. Just when it flares up. I buy it at the drugstore. Little blue pills. That’s all. Vitamins? Supplements? Nah. Never been much for all that fancy stuff. Real food is what a man needs. Cuban coffee and a good roast pork… that's medicine enough for me. Though, lately, even that feels like work to eat. All this breathin’ trouble… makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just occasional pain reliever for arthritis, and nothing else regularly. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and feel your legs to see if there’s any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Lung and heart, huh? Alright. Sounds… thorough. As long as you ain’t gonna poke me too much. My niece always said I was a sensitive man. Swellin' in the legs? Don’t think so. Mostly just… tired legs. From sittin’ too much, probably. Go ahead, Doc. Get it over with. Just try not to make it a whole afternoon, huh? I got a show I like to watch at three.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, just take some deep breaths for me. In and out… good. Alright, and now I’m going to listen to your heart. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Your oxygen level is 91%. That’s a little low. I do notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles. It’s mild, but it’s there. I also notice you're using some extra effort to breathe, and I can hear some wheezing in your lungs. Do you feel any pain when I press on your chest?
PATIENT: Wheezin’, huh? Told ya. And low oxygen? That don’t surprise me none. Extra effort… yeah, feels like I’m tryin’ to suck air through a straw, like I said before. Pain? A little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's tight. It's been gettin’ worse lately, though. Especially at night. Sometimes I gotta sit up to breathe. Can’t sleep layin’ flat. And this swellin’… never noticed it before. My ankles always felt kinda big, but I figured it was just… me. Old age, probably. Everything’s fallin’ apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain is a dull discomfort that worsens with lying flat, and you experience it at night, requiring you to sit up to breathe. The swelling in your ankles is new. Based on what you're telling me and what I'm hearing and feeling, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. The shortness of breath, wheezing, low oxygen, ankle swelling, and the difficulty breathing when lying flat are all consistent with those conditions. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to do a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to look at your kidney function and check for certain markers that can indicate heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? More pokin' and proddin’. Well… I guess if it’ll tell ya what’s wrong. Kidneys? I thought we were talkin’ about breathin’ and the heart. But alright. Chest X-ray, EKG, blood work… Do I gotta fast for the blood work? I had a good breakfast. Cuban toast and coffee, you know. And sugar. Will the sugar mess it up? I don’t want this to take all day. That show starts at three. And I don’t want to be stickin’ needles in my arm if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to fast for the blood work, Mr. Guilds. The sugar won’t affect the tests we’re ordering. And yes, we can minimize the poking and prodding as much as possible. We’ll just need a small sample of blood for the lab. The chest X-ray and EKG are quick and painless. The X-ray is just a brief exposure to radiation – a very small amount, and it gives us a good image of your lungs. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and then take you to the X-ray and EKG rooms. It should take about an hour or so, and we'll get the results back as quickly as possible. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An hour, huh? Alright. Better than all day. Stickers? I can handle stickers. As long as they don’t pull on my skin too much. Alright, alright. Do it. Get it over with. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. I ain’t been feelin’ so strong lately. And… what if it is somethin’ bad? Somethin’ really bad? Will you… will you tell me straight? Don’t sugarcoat it. I’m an old man. I can handle the truth. But no rushin' me, okay? I gotta know what I'm dealin' with. And… what about the show? Is there any chance I can still catch it? Even if it's just a little bit?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds, and I promise to be completely honest with you. We’ll go over the results together as soon as they’re available, and I’ll explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. I won’t rush you, and I’ll answer all your questions. Right now, it's too early to say for sure what's going on. But we’re taking the right steps to find out. As for the show, let's focus on getting these tests done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan and see if it’s possible to adjust your schedule. But right now, your health is the most important thing. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. She’s very gentle and experienced. And again, please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any point.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Get it over with. Just… be careful. And tell her about the needle. I don't want no surprises. And hurry up, okay? Three o'clock is comin’ fast. It’s a good show. Can’t miss it. Old age… fallin' apart… everything fallin' apart...
DOCTOR: I will, Mr. Guilds. I'll make sure she’s very careful. I’ll also let her know about your concerns. Nurse Rodriguez, could you please come in and draw some blood from Mr. Guilds?
