DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my muscles. They just feel weak. Like, not a sudden thing, it’s been building for a bit now. Hard to explain, really. It's just… tiring to do things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Tiring to do things.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. Like, getting up from a chair takes effort. Used to just… do it. Now I gotta kinda… brace myself. And carrying groceries? Forget about it. Used to be nothing, now it feels like I’m lifting weights. It's mostly in my legs and arms, I think. Not… all over, exactly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, to a degree. And how long has this been progressing?
PATIENT: Progressing… gosh. It's hard to pinpoint. Maybe… three, four months now? Started kinda slow, just noticing things were a little harder. Didn't think much of it at first, figured I was just getting older, you know? But it's definitely getting worse. It’s not sudden, like I said, just… steady.
DOCTOR: Steady… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I haven’t been sick, no fever or anything. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from… well, from life. I don’t know. It’s mostly just the weakness, really. Though… now that you mention it, maybe I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. But that could be the stress of everything, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Weight, probably a little bit down. Not a lot, I haven't really been tracking it. Appetite's okay, I eat pretty normally. Bowel habits… no, nothing different there. Regular as clockwork, thankfully. Sorry, is this too much detail? I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s good. Details are helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never been a big hospital person, thankfully. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But nothing serious, nothing chronic. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, to be honest. A bit of a worry wart, maybe, but physically… yeah, pretty good. Though, I haven’t really seen a doctor in… a while. Years, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils. I’m lucky that way, I guess. Always tried to avoid them if I could. Always figured if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Seems like a lot of folks end up with more problems from the surgery than they started with, you know? Not trying to be difficult, just… that’s always been my outlook.
DOCTOR: I understand your caution. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My dad, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad in her hands. But other than that, not really. No history of muscle problems, or anything like that. They both lived to be pretty old, actually, so maybe I just got unlucky. I’m not sure. It’s just… this weakness is worrying me. I need to be strong, I do a lot of driving for work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your work... what exactly do you do?
PATIENT: I'm an insurance appraiser, auto damage. So, I go out and look at wrecked cars, figure out how much the damage is, write up a report. It involves a lot of… getting in and out of cars, bending, lifting, walking around in dusty places. And a lot of driving, like I said. It’s not heavy lifting, but it’s constant, you know? Been doing it for… fifteen years now, maybe more. It’s a good job, pays the bills, but it's starting to feel… harder.
DOCTOR: And what about social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Well… I don’t really go out much. Work keeps me pretty busy. I live alone, never married. I have a few friends, we get together for coffee sometimes, watch a game on TV. I don’t drink, never really liked alcohol. I don't smoke. Pretty quiet life, honestly. Is that what you were getting at? I don’t want to bore you with details…
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Doctors always ask, and I always say no. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm pretty lucky that way, too. Seriously, I can't think of a single thing I’m allergic to. Maybe dust? It makes me sneeze sometimes, but that’s it. That’s not really an allergy, though, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Never been much of a pill-popper. Always figured if I could avoid it, I would. I try to stay healthy, eat right, get enough sleep… well, try to get enough sleep. I don’t really believe in loading up on medication unless I absolutely have to. I really hope you can figure out what's going on. This weakness is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and do a basic neurological assessment. It won’t be anything uncomfortable. It will just help me to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Patellar and biceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Not particularly brisk or diminished. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that enough? I don't know if I'm squeezing as hard as I used to, though. It feels a little… weak, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s harder than it looks. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I'm fighting against something… a lot of resistance. It’s not like I’m not trying, it’s just… difficult. I used to be able to do this with no problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all extremities, meaning good, but not full strength. There's some mild fatigue noted with sustained effort. Sensation appears intact. Gait is steady, but slightly wider than normal. Coordination is grossly intact. Now, I'd like to order some bloodwork. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and vitamin D levels. We'll also check your creatine kinase, which can help us rule out muscle damage.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Creatine kinase… is that something serious? I just want to know what's causing this weakness. It’s starting to worry me a lot, especially with my work. I need to be strong. When will I get the results? And what happens next?
DOCTOR: It's a routine test, Mr. McKinnon. It helps us assess muscle health. Don't jump to conclusions. The results should be back in a few days—usually around three to five business days. Once we have those, we’ll review them, and I’ll contact you to discuss the findings. Depending on what they show, we may need to consider further testing, such as an electromyography—an EMG—to evaluate the electrical activity of your muscles. It’s unlikely to be anything truly dire, but we need to rule out possibilities. Don’t overthink it. For now, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and get plenty of rest. I’ll also give you a list of exercises you can do at home—gentle stretches and strengthening exercises—once we have the bloodwork results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… three to five days. I can do that. Gentle exercises… alright. No, I think that covers it… for now. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this, Doctor. I just want to get back to normal, you know? Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will schedule the bloodwork for you on your way out. I’ll be in touch. .
PATIENT: .
