DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Boham, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Mikeisha Boham. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dech-ene? I hope I said that right.
DOCTOR: Dech-ene is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so if we could just get straight to the point… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s… my sinuses, I think. They feel… bad. Like pressure, a lot of pressure. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. It just… started feeling bad.
DOCTOR: "A while." Right. And when you say “bad,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific. Well, it hurts when I bend over. And sometimes I feel… stuffy. Like I can’t breathe good through my nose. Not all the time, but often. It's… uncomfortable. I don't know what else to say. It just feels… blocked, maybe?
DOCTOR: Blocked. And is this accompanied by any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. I haven't checked my temperature. I feel warm sometimes, but I don't know if that's just… the weather? It's been hot, you know? I don't get sick often, so I don’t really check for that.
DOCTOR: Right. Any facial pain?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Mostly… around my eyes and my forehead. It's not a bad bad pain, but… it’s there. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes. And… my cheeks feel a little tender, if I press on them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… moderately descriptive. Have you tried anything to alleviate the symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I tried… some of those over-the-counter medicines. The ones for… colds, I think. They didn't really help much. And I tried… hot water with lemon. My mother always said that helped. But… it didn’t last. It felt good for a minute, then it came back.
DOCTOR: Right. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… I don’t know. I don’t think so. I mean, I haven’t been told I have any. We didn't have much money when I was growing up to go to doctors a lot. Everything was… simpler then. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything that I know of. Maybe I do? I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just have a quick look. Open wide.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Is there… something you’re looking for? I’m not very good at knowing what doctors look for.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Throat looks… unremarkable. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me. And another. Lungs are clear. It sounds like… maybe just a bit of congestion.
PATIENT: Okay. Congestion? Like… too much stuff? I told you about my sinuses. Is that what you mean? Is there anything… serious? I get worried sometimes. My husband, he’s the calm one. I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be anything serious at this stage. It sounds like a fairly standard sinus infection. I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic. Take it as directed, and if it doesn’t improve within a week, come back. Do you have any drug allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, an antibiotic… okay. No, I don’t think so. Like I said, I haven’t had many problems with medicine. I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything. What… what does it do? I don’t want to sound silly, but I don’t really understand what it does in my body. I hope it doesn’t make me feel sick.
DOCTOR: It… fights the infection. It’s not always pleasant, but it’s usually effective. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy. I’m also recommending a saline nasal spray to help with the congestion. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Fight the infection… that sounds good. A nasal spray too? I think… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Is there a cost to the medicine? I… we don’t have insurance, and things are tight right now. I just want to make sure… my husband works hard, but it’s not always enough.
DOCTOR: That's… something you’ll have to discuss with the pharmacy. I don’t have access to that information. Next patient. .
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. .
