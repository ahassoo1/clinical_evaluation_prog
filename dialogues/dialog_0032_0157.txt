DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. My husband drove me, and he’s waiting. It’s my blood pressure. It’s been… high, I guess. The machine at the pharmacy keeps saying it is. That’s all there is to it, really.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re pressed for time, Ms. Dudney. However, "high" is rather vague, and it’s important for me to gather a complete picture. When you say the machine at the pharmacy has indicated elevated blood pressure, do you recall what the readings were, approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Numbers aren’t my thing. That’s why I come to doctors, isn’t it? To tell me the numbers? I just know it was red. Everything was red on the screen. And the lady at the counter gave me a look. It was embarrassing. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Dudney, a single reading, or even a recollection of a red screen, isn’t sufficient to determine the appropriate course of action. We need actual numbers to assess the severity and potential underlying causes. It's possible the machine was faulty, or you were simply stressed at the time. Do you have any history of hypertension – has a previous doctor ever mentioned your blood pressure being elevated?
PATIENT: No. And I don’t get stressed. I just… don’t like wasting time. Look, my mother always had good blood pressure. Perfectly good. She was a strong woman. I get it from her. This machine is probably wrong. Can we just… confirm it’s wrong and be done? My husband hates waiting rooms.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, with all due respect, dismissing a potential health concern simply because your mother had normal blood pressure isn't sound medical practice. While genetics play a role, many factors can influence blood pressure. I understand your husband's dislike of waiting rooms, but I need to perform a proper assessment. I’m going to take your blood pressure now, and then we can discuss the results. It’s a quick procedure, and it will provide us with the information we need. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. And don’t tell me about genetics or… lifestyle choices. I don’t want a lecture. Just take the reading. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit comfortably and remain still. I'll explain what I'm doing as I go. I’m simply inflating the cuff now… and listening for the sounds of your pulse. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay… that gives us a reading of 152 over 94.
PATIENT: 152 over… what? Is that bad? See, this is why I came to you. What does that even mean? And is it just a faulty machine? It has to be. My mother… she'd be appalled.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, a reading of 152 over 94 is elevated. It falls into Stage 2 hypertension, according to current guidelines. And while a faulty machine is always a possibility, we need to rule out other causes. Your mother's blood pressure, while relevant, doesn't negate the fact that your blood pressure is currently high. Let's review your medical history to see if there's anything here that might explain this. Do you have any known allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no medications. Never have. I eat healthy, mostly. And I get plenty of rest when I can. This is ridiculous. You're going to tell me I need pills, aren't you? I just knew it. My husband warned me about doctors. Always wanting to put people on something. I don’t need pills. I need a better machine. Or maybe… maybe I was just worried about something. It was a long drive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I assure you, my intention is not to immediately prescribe medication. However, dismissing elevated blood pressure as simply stress or a faulty machine without further investigation would be irresponsible. Before we discuss potential treatments, we need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated. I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms – headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. A little annoyed, maybe, because of all this fuss. But fine. I don’t get headaches. I see perfectly well. And my chest feels… normal. Honestly, I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing. My husband’s going to be furious. He said I should have just gotten a new machine. Can we just… write a note for a new machine? That’s all. A new machine and then we're done. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, while I understand your frustration, simply obtaining a new machine will not address the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure. I'm concerned enough about this reading that I strongly recommend further evaluation. I would like to order some basic blood work – a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel – to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. Additionally, an EKG would be prudent to check your heart function. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Are you serious? This is getting ridiculous. Blood work? An… EKG? I told you, I feel fine. My husband is waiting. And honestly, I don't like needles. At all. No. Absolutely not. Just… give me something to lower it right now, and I’ll go home. Can’t you just… write a prescription? A small one? Something to calm it down? This is a waste of my time. And my husband's. He has things to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand you're anxious and want a quick solution, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is not sound medical practice. It could potentially mask an underlying condition and lead to more serious health problems. Furthermore, I cannot and will not prescribe medication based on a single elevated reading and your reluctance to undergo basic diagnostic tests. Given your resistance to further evaluation and your clear preference for immediate symptom relief, I recommend that you consult with another physician who can better align with your healthcare expectations. I am happy to provide you with a list of qualified specialists in the area. However, please understand that I strongly advise against delaying proper medical attention. This is not a matter to be taken lightly.
