DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 52 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Delano Alcorta. Fifty-two, though I feel younger, naturally. It’s my vision, you see. It’s… deteriorating. Not suddenly, mind you, but noticeably. It’s becoming quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Deteriorating over what timeframe, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Well, now, that's a difficult question. It hasn't been a swift decline, Doctor. Perhaps… the last few years? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. One doesn't simply notice these things overnight, you understand. It's a gradual fading, like an old photograph. Though, I will say it seems to have accelerated somewhat recently. Perhaps the last six months or so.
DOCTOR: Six months of noticeable acceleration… alright. And can you describe the deterioration to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it’s not as if I’m going blind, Doctor. But things aren’t… sharp. Distant objects are blurry, of course. And reading…reading is becoming rather a strain. I find myself holding things further and further away. It’s… bothersome. I used to be able to read anything, any size print, without a second thought. Now? It requires effort. A considerable amount of effort, I might add. And quite frankly, I don’t appreciate having to exert myself unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily difficulty with distance and near vision. Is it worse at certain times of the day, or in specific lighting conditions?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. It seems to be worse in the evenings, naturally. When the light is dimmer. And, truthfully, I’ve noticed it’s particularly bothersome when I’m driving at dusk. Quite dangerous, really. One has to strain to see the lines on the road. Though I assure you, Doctor, I am a very careful driver. Always have been. It’s the vision that’s the problem, not the driver.
DOCTOR: Worsening in low light, particularly with driving. Very good. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the blurring?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No, not really. No pain, no flashing lights, no… floaters, is that what they call them? No, nothing like that. Just…diminished clarity. A general fuzziness, if you will. It's… frustrating. I've always prided myself on my keen eyesight. It's a family trait, you see. My grandfather had excellent vision well into his nineties. This… this is simply unacceptable. Though, I suppose one can't fight the inevitable, can one?
DOCTOR: We shall see, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s review your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not particularly. I’ve always been a rather robust individual, truth be told. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. And… well, my divorce, if you consider that a condition. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. But physically? I’m in good health. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… anything of that nature. I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. Though I do enjoy a good scotch now and again. Moderation in all things, that's my motto.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard. A few childhood illnesses, naturally. Chickenpox, measles… the usual things. But nothing requiring a surgeon’s attention. I’ve always been careful, you see. I avoid unnecessary risks. A sensible man avoids unnecessary complications. Though I did have a rather nasty wisdom tooth extracted in my twenties, but that hardly counts as a hospitalization. A local anesthetic and a bit of discomfort, that was all. Nothing to write home about, certainly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a bit more complicated. My mother, bless her soul, had rather poor eyesight later in life. Needed glasses, eventually. And my paternal grandfather… he did develop cataracts, I believe. Though he lived to be ninety-three, so one can hardly blame genetics entirely. He led a full life, cataracts and all. My father, however, had excellent vision his entire life. So, a bit of a mixed bag, really. It's difficult to say whether this is inherited, or simply the inevitable march of time. Frankly, I suspect it's the latter. One can’t expect to remain youthful forever, can one?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely none. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. A good diet, plenty of rest, and a sensible lifestyle… that’s all one needs. I’ve always been skeptical of these… modern remedies. Too many side effects, in my opinion. I prefer natural solutions, if possible. Though I confess, I do take a multivitamin now and again. Just to be on the safe side, you understand. But that’s hardly a medication. A bit of insurance, that's all.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything… or rather, don't take anything, as we've established. No reactions, no hives, no… unpleasantness of any kind. I’ve always considered myself remarkably robust, as I mentioned before. A bit of a miracle, really. One can’t be too careful these days, with all these… sensitivities people seem to have. I simply haven't been bothered. It’s a blessing, truly. Perhaps it’s the Cherokee blood. We’re a hardy people, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Well, given your history, it sounds like we're dealing with a gradual onset of vision changes. I'd like to perform a brief eye exam to assess your visual acuity and check the health of your eyes. It's a standard procedure, and should give us a better understanding of what's going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An exam, yes. Of course. Though I must confess, I’m rather skeptical of what it will reveal. As I've stated, I suspect this is simply the natural progression of things. But I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Lead on, Doctor. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have… commitments later this afternoon. A rather important appointment, you see. But I shall endeavor to be patient. Just so long as it’s not too intrusive. I have always valued my personal space.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. It will be a fairly standard examination, and shouldn’t be overly intrusive. Please, have a seat, and look straight ahead. I'll start with a visual acuity test. First, I'm going to ask you to read the smallest line of letters you can see on this chart. Cover your left eye with this patch, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, Doctor, my distance vision isn't what it once was. I suspect this will be rather… disappointing. Proceed when you are ready. Though, please, don't expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Focus on this chart, and read the letters from left to right as clearly as possible. Start with the top line, and work your way down. Don't strain, just read what you can see. Okay, can you read this first line for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see… E… F… P… T… Hmm. Yes, those are… clear enough. Though the spacing is rather… cramped, wouldn’t you agree? Is this a standard chart, Doctor? I wouldn’t want to misinterpret the results due to… suboptimal presentation.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, this is a standard chart. It appears your vision is 20/30 in your right eye. Now, let's try the next line. Can you read these letters for me, please?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… V… N… Q… I… Hmm… this is… difficult. The letters are rather… blurred. Is there a way to… sharpen the image? Perhaps a different type of lens? I assure you, Doctor, my vision used to be far superior to this. I find this… disconcerting. Though, as I've stated, I'm not surprised. The world is simply not what it once was. I believe that's it. Though I wouldn't stake my reputation on its accuracy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s move on to the next line. Can you attempt to read these letters?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I simply cannot discern any letters on that line. They are… a blur. Completely indistinct. It’s… frustrating, really. I used to be able to read anything, any size print, without a second thought. This is… quite alarming, actually. I believe this confirms my suspicions. My vision is deteriorating at a rather… rapid pace. Perhaps we should move on to another test. This is… unproductive.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. It seems your visual acuity is approximately 20/40 in your right eye. Now, let’s check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to look straight ahead at this point, and let me know when you see a light flash in your peripheral vision. Just say “Yes” when you see it. We’ll test each eye separately.
PATIENT: Yes. Yes. No. Yes. It’s rather dim in here, Doctor. Perhaps the lights are not bright enough to be adequately detected. I have always had excellent peripheral vision, you see. This is… concerning. I trust your equipment is properly calibrated?
DOCTOR: The equipment is calibrated, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s continue. I'll be presenting lights in different areas of your peripheral vision. Just say “Yes” when you see them. Yes?
PATIENT: No. Yes. No. Doctor, I believe there's a slight flicker in the overhead lighting. It’s rather distracting, and makes it difficult to accurately perceive these… subtle flashes. It’s affecting my concentration, you see. Perhaps a different room would be more conducive to a proper examination? I pride myself on my accuracy, and I’m concerned that these conditions are compromising the results.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. It seems we’re having some difficulty with the peripheral vision test. We'll skip that for now. Let’s check the health of your eyes with the ophthalmoscope. I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to examine the retina. This won’t be painful, but it may be slightly uncomfortable. Look straight ahead, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I have a rather sensitive constitution. I do hope this won't be too… invasive. Hmm. That’s… bright. Very bright indeed. Are you seeing anything of concern? I trust your assessment will be thorough and accurate. I’ve always been meticulous about my health, you see. And I do have commitments later this afternoon. I trust this won't take too long?
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Alcorta. This won’t take long. Alright. I'm observing some mild drusen in your macula, and a slight pallor to the optic disc. The retinal blood vessels appear relatively normal, but there is some narrowing in the arterioles. Overall, the findings are consistent with early signs of age-related macular degeneration, and possible early signs of hypertension. It’s not an emergency, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Hypertension? Doctor, are you certain? I lead a perfectly healthy lifestyle. I do enjoy a scotch now and again, naturally, but I assure you, it’s in moderation. And I’ve never had any problems with my blood pressure. Are you absolutely certain this isn’t a misdiagnosis? I find this… disturbing, to say the least. And what does this mean for my vision? Will I go blind? This is… unacceptable. I believe a second opinion is warranted. Perhaps a specialist? I trust you won’t object?
DOCTOR: It’s early stages, Mr. Alcorta, and a definitive diagnosis requires further testing. The findings I’ve observed are preliminary. A referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam is certainly warranted. They can perform more specialized tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. I also recommend a blood pressure check with your primary care physician. To answer your question, I don't anticipate you going blind immediately. Early detection and management can help slow the progression of macular degeneration, and control hypertension. I will be happy to provide a referral. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: A referral, yes. Please. A comprehensive exam is… prudent. And a blood pressure check, naturally. Though I maintain it’s likely a false alarm. Still, one can’t be too careful. And please, make sure this specialist is… reputable. I’ve had unpleasant experiences with less-than-competent practitioners in the past. And schedule it as soon as possible, if you would be so kind. My commitments, you see… they’re rather important. And Doctor, I trust you’ll send a complete copy of your findings? I like to be fully informed about my health. It’s my right, naturally.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will schedule a comprehensive exam with Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. She’s known for her thoroughness and expertise. I will also send a complete copy of my findings to her office, and ensure a copy is provided to you. I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you now. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers it. Thank you for your… assessment. Though I must confess, I’m not entirely reassured. Still, one must remain optimistic. I trust Dr. Vance is… thorough. And please, do remind her of my commitments. Time is… precious, you see. I believe that will be all. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. My assistant will be with you shortly to finalize the appointment and provide instructions. Have a good day.
