DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, if you could just briefly tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Popova is the name, Aldine Popova. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for a bit now, it has. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes. But when it does come…oof. Feels like someone’s tightened a belt right around me skull.
DOCTOR: Right, a headache. And how long has this “belt-tightening” sensation been occurring, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... it started… oh, maybe a month ago? Around the beginning of July, I reckon. It wasn't bad at first, just a little niggle, really. I thought it was just from bein' in the sun too long, workin' on me feet all day. But it’s gotten…more noticeable since then. I try to ignore it, but it gets harder and harder.
DOCTOR: “Work on your feet all day”?
PATIENT: I'm a manicurist, Doctor. And a pedicurist. Been doin' it for…well, a long time now. Sixty years, come next year. Lovely work, truly. But it does mean bein’ on me feet, bendin’ and stretchin’ and reachin’… all day long. Makes you feel it, it does. Especially when you get a bit older, like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else accompanying these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. Now, nothin' major. Sometimes me vision gets a little…fuzzy, when the headache’s bad. Not a complete blur, just…not as sharp, you know? And… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, like I’m swayin' just a touch. That don't last long though, just a few seconds. It's hard to say if that’s connected to the headache or just me gettin' up too fast. I'm an old man, after all.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy vision and dizziness. Right. Any nausea or vomiting associated with these episodes?
PATIENT: Nausea… hmm. Not exactly vomiting, no. But sometimes me stomach feels a bit… unsettled. Like I’ve eaten somethin’ that didn’t quite agree with me. Not often, mind you, but it's happened a couple of times when the headache’s real bad. It don't last long, just a queasy feelin’. Never actually thrown up, though, thankfully. Wouldn't wish that on anyone.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of head trauma?
PATIENT: Head trauma… let me think now. Not a major trauma, no. Never been in no car accidents or nothin’ like that. But… when I was a young man, I used to box. A little bit, you know? Just local matches, nothin’ professional. I took a few hits to the head over the years, I suppose. But that was a long time ago. Sixty years, at least. Never thought much of it since. Does that count, Doctor?
DOCTOR: History of boxing. Very well. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a single one. Always been healthy as a horse, I reckon. Never liked takin' pills if I could avoid it. Just a bit of liniment for me aches and pains, that’s all. And a good cup of chamomile tea when I can’t sleep. Old remedies are the best, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a brief neurological exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m not afraid of a little look-see. Though, be gentle now, alright? These old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Look straight ahead. Follow my finger. Don’t move your head. Now look to your left… to your right… Good. Squeeze my hands. Hard. Now resist. Pupils equal, reactive to light. Now, close your eyes. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can see your finger. Though, it's a bit blurry if I squint. And yes, I’m squeezin’ as hard as I can. Feels like you're tryin' to crush mine, to be honest! And yes, I can feel that. Feels like… cotton wool, sort of. Not a strong sensation, though. Is somethin’ wrong, Doctor? You seemin’ to move awfully fast.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes… equal bilaterally. Achilles… also equal. Now, stand up and walk for me. Heel-to-toe. Alright. That will be sufficient for now.
PATIENT: Heel-to-toe, you say? A bit unsteady, I’m afraid. These old legs aren’t what they used to be. Is everything alright, Doctor? You didn’t say nothin’ about how I was doin’. Is it somethin’ serious? You're worryin’ me now.
DOCTOR: Based on the limited neurological exam, and given your age and history, I suspect… tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by your occupation. The dizziness and visual disturbances could be related to mild dehydration or age-related changes in blood pressure. However, given the history of boxing, we need to rule out… other possibilities. I'm ordering a CT scan of your head, just to be safe. It’s standard procedure. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding strenuous activity until we have the results. A nurse will be in shortly to schedule the scan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? A scan of me head…? Is that…serious, Doctor? What "other possibilities" are you talkin' about? I mean, it was sixty years ago! Just a bit of boxin’, nothin’ major. I don’t understand. And what about the dehydration? I drink plenty of water, I do. This is all a bit much, to be honest. I just came in for a headache… You're makin’ it sound like I'm…dyin'. Can you just tell me, plain and simple, what you're thinkin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concern. The CT scan is a precautionary measure. While the boxing occurred decades ago, we need to rule out any chronic subdural hematoma or other structural abnormalities that may be contributing to your symptoms. It is unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. I also suspect some mild dehydration may be exacerbating the headaches. As for my professional opinion, I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive workup, to evaluate for any underlying neurological concerns. It's a standard protocol to ensure the best course of treatment for your condition. I understand you want a simple answer, and my simple answer is we need to rule out certain possibilities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? Another doctor…? And…a hematoma? Is that…dangerous? I just wanted some advice for me headache, that’s all. I don’t even know what a ‘subdural hematoma’ is. And all this talk of scans and specialists… it sounds…expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know. Can you just… explain it to me like I’m a child, Doctor? And tell me, honestly, is this somethin’ I should be really worried about? Or is it just somethin’ minor, that a bit of rest and water will fix? I'm an old man, Doctor. I just want to live out me days in peace.
DOCTOR: A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood on the brain. It can occur from head trauma, even if the trauma occurred long ago. It's not always dangerous, but it can cause headaches, dizziness, and other neurological symptoms. The scan will determine if you have one. As for the cost…I am aware you are uninsured. I will have the hospital financial department contact you regarding payment options. Regarding your symptoms, it’s impossible to say definitively without the scan results. However, it is prudent to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I understand your concern, Mr. Popova, but I must emphasize the importance of thorough investigation. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule the scan. Do you have any further questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I…I don't think so. You've said everything, I suppose. A scan…a neurologist…financial department… It’s all a bit overwhelming. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. Just…please, be gentle with me. This is all very frightening. I’ll wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
