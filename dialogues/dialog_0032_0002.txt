DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my waterworks, you see? It’s been… tricky. Not easy, not easy at all. It just… takes a while, sometimes. A long while. I don't really know what else to say. It's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Difficult, you say. Alright. Can you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Oh… hmm. Well, like I said, it takes a long time to… go. And sometimes it feels like it doesn’t want to go at all! I have to… push, a little. Not hard, just… encourage it. And then it comes out… slowly. It’s been going on for… a bit now. Maybe a few weeks? Or was it months? I get so mixed up these days. My husband, he notices more than I do, probably.
DOCTOR: A few weeks or months… alright. And is this a constant issue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It’s… mostly constant, I think. Some days are worse than others, definitely. Like yesterday was really bad. I had to… well, I had to go back to the bathroom a few times. But today isn't too bad. Just… takes a bit of effort, you know? It's not painful, thankfully. Just… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. And have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Stream? Oh… you mean… when it comes out? Hmm. Well, it’s not as strong as it used to be, I think. My husband says so, anyway. He’s always noticing these things. It doesn’t… shoot out like it used to. More like… dribbles. That sounds awful, doesn't it? But that's the best way to describe it. It's not a big, strong stream anymore. Just… weak. And sometimes… it stops and starts, a few times. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty starting the stream, or any sensation of not being able to empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That happens sometimes. It takes a moment… a moment to… get going. Like it’s shy, or something. And… you know, after I go, it doesn’t always feel like everything came out. Like there's a little bit left. Not a lot, just… a feeling. I have to… try again sometimes, to make sure. It's just… frustrating. I don't want to sit here all day! Is something bad wrong? I get so worried.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Stoffregen, it could be a number of things. At your age, it's not uncommon to experience changes in bladder function. It’s likely related to weakening of the bladder muscles, or perhaps a decrease in bladder sensitivity. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have a history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear, infections? I don't think so. Not that I remember. I’ve had a few little… aches and pains over the years, but nothing specific with my… waterworks. My doctor always just said it was old age! He retired a few years ago, now. A nice man, Doctor… what was his name? Oh, I can't remember! Anyway, he never mentioned infections. My husband might know, he keeps all the medical papers. He's very organized, that man. Is an infection something serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Stoffregen. That's why it's important to investigate. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Besides what your previous doctor told you, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I have a little bit of… achiness in my joints, you know, like arthritis, I think? Nothing too bad. And my blood pressure… sometimes it goes up a little, but I take a little pill for that. And… oh, I had a little operation on my hip a few years ago. Fell down the stairs, silly me! Other than that… I don't really know. I try not to worry about things too much. My husband does most of the remembering when it comes to doctors and pills. He'll know better about all that. He’s very good at that sort of thing. Should I get him? He’s just in the waiting room.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your husband's assistance, Ms. Stoffregen, it would be helpful to hear the information directly from you, if possible. However, if you truly cannot recall, then yes, we can speak with him. But let's try to focus for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! There’s one… for my waterworks. It’s a little orange pill. My doctor, the old one, gave it to me a while back. It's supposed to help me… go easier. But I don't really think it helps much. It just makes me… thirsty. And… sometimes I forget to take it. See? I get so mixed up. And I think… I think there’s another one, for my… tummy. It's white, I think. But I don't take it very often. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I really should write these things down, shouldn't I? My husband keeps telling me to. He says I'm a mess! But I just… forget. Is it okay if we just call him? He'll know everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Let’s bring your husband in. It appears we need to gather a more complete medical history. Please excuse me a moment while I have the nurse page him.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That would be wonderful. He’s just right outside, I think. He worries so much about me. He’ll be so relieved to help. I just wish I could remember things better! It’s so frustrating. Maybe I'm just getting old. But he'll know everything. Yes, everything. He always does.
