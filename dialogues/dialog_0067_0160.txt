DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I wish I wasn't here. I don’t have time for this, really. But my daughter insisted. I've just been… tired. Really tired. And I've been… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been craving dirt. Like, actual earth. Don't look at me like that. It's ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s good you came in, and I appreciate your honesty. Craving dirt is… unusual, certainly, but it’s helpful information. And being tired is very common, so we'll figure out what’s going on. Just to clarify, when you say tired, is that just feeling generally run down, or is it more than that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a little tired, dear. It’s… draining. Like someone's unplugged me. I can barely get through the day at work. And then I just want to lie down. All the time. Even getting up to fix something to eat feels like a huge effort. And then… the dirt. It doesn't help with the tiredness, obviously, but it's… a feeling. I can’t explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significantly draining fatigue that interferes with your daily activities, and this craving for dirt… It sounds like this has been impacting your quality of life. Can you tell me roughly how long you've been feeling this tired, and when did the cravings start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The tiredness… it's been creeping up on me, really, for maybe six months? But the really bad part, where I can barely function, that's been maybe two months. And the dirt… started around the same time as the bad tiredness. Honestly, I thought it was just a phase. You know, getting older, things get a little… strange.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all this with me. Six months of increasing fatigue, with a more severe decline in the last two months, and the cravings starting around the same time. That gives us a good starting point. Now, to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Ugh, work. It’s… physical. I'm a physical therapist aide. Mostly helping people with their exercises, moving them around, getting equipment ready. It's not easy work, not at my age, anyway. I’ve been doing it for… oh, Lord, almost twenty years now. It keeps me on my feet, that's for sure. But I'm starting to think I'm not cut out for it anymore.
DOCTOR: Twenty years is a long time! And physical work, even if you enjoy it, can definitely take a toll. So, you’ve been doing this physically demanding job for two decades, and this fatigue has been gradually increasing over the last six months, coinciding with a decline in your energy levels. Let's talk about other things you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, my appetite’s been… off. Some days I don’t feel like eating anything. And when I do, it's usually just… bland things. Nothing flavorful. Salads, plain rice. I used to love spicy food. Now? It makes me feel sick. And I've been a little… forgetful. But who isn't at my age? It's probably just… old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, a preference for bland foods, and some forgetfulness. It’s good you’re telling me about these things. While forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging, coupled with the fatigue, appetite changes, and craving for dirt, it's important to investigate. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Do I have to talk about that? Honestly, I'd rather not. But fine. They’re… irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s embarrassing to even talk about. And I haven't been able to… well, get everything out, if you know what I mean. It's just...uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Candis. These are important things to discuss, and you’re not alone in experiencing them. Changes in bowel habits can be a clue to what’s going on. So irregular bowel movements, difficulty with complete evacuation… Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… my clothes are a little looser. I hadn't really thought anything of it. I figured it was just… getting older. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. Too depressing. But yeah, I probably have lost a little weight. Not a lot, but enough to notice my pants aren’t as snug.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unintentional weight loss, alongside the fatigue, appetite changes, irregular bowel movements, and the craving for dirt… and you're a physical therapist aide. I'm going to ask about your past medical history now, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. Let me see… Nothing major, really. I had the flu a few times, of course. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years ago? And arthritis, a little, in my hands. But that’s it. Nothing serious. I'm generally a healthy person, or I was, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so flu, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some arthritis in your hands. And no other major medical conditions diagnosed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I've been lucky, I guess. I’ve never been one for hospitals or doctors, if I can avoid it. That’s probably why I let this tiredness go on so long. I just hoped it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: That's alright. It's common to want to avoid medical interventions when possible. And no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family with a history of anemia, or any digestive problems like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... that's a tough one. My mother had… well, she wasn't feeling well toward the end, but the doctors never really said what was wrong with her. Just that she was “old.” My father… he was a healthy man, lived a long life. And my siblings… I don’t really keep in close touch. I think my brother had some stomach problems once, but I can't remember what it was. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history with a mother who was unwell toward the end of her life, and a brother with some unspecified stomach problems. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Do you want to know about my love life? Because that’s a very short story. I've been single for… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: No, Candis, not your love life! I’m asking about things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and your typical diet. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, I see. No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Horrible habit. My mother always said so. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, if I’m feeling festive. But that's about it. I try to eat healthy, but like I said, my appetite hasn’t been good lately. Mostly salads and plain rice. It's not very exciting, but it's something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and you try to maintain a healthy diet when you have an appetite. Now, one last question about your background before we move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had any allergic reactions. I’ve been lucky in that regard as well. Honestly, I don’t take many medications. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that’s about it. I don’t like filling my body with chemicals if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s been very helpful. So, to summarize, you’re a 79-year-old female experiencing significant fatigue for six months, worsening in the last two months, alongside decreased appetite, a preference for bland foods, irregular bowel movements, unintentional weight loss, and a craving for dirt. You have a history of gallbladder removal and some arthritis, but no other significant medical conditions. You don’t smoke, drink alcohol only occasionally, and have no known allergies. Given your symptoms, especially the craving for dirt, also known as pica, I’m concerned about a possible iron deficiency anemia. It’s also important to rule out other causes for your fatigue and weight loss. I'd like to start with a blood test to check your iron levels and other important blood counts. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Honestly, that doesn't surprise me. I've always been a little weak. And I guess eating dirt probably isn't helping. Fine, do the blood test. Let's just get this over with. I have things to do, you know. But if it's going to take all day, I'm not staying. I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll order the blood test now. It shouldn't take too long – we can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It'll take a few days to get the results back. We'll also want to do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, as well as a thyroid test, to rule out other potential causes of your fatigue. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your daily activities, just to get a better sense of how this is impacting your life. First, how would you rate your energy levels on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being completely exhausted and 10 being full of energy?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? A two. Maybe a three on a good day. It's just... draining. Everything feels like such an effort. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. I used to be so active, always on the go. Now? I mostly just sit around and try not to think about how tired I am. It's pathetic. But don't tell anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it’s not pathetic at all. It takes courage to acknowledge these things. A two or three out of ten – that confirms how significantly this is impacting your daily life. Now, are you having any difficulty with your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I used to sleep like a log. Now? I toss and turn all night. Wake up several times. When I do finally fall asleep, it's not a restful sleep. I feel just as tired when I wake up as when I went to bed. And sometimes, I just lie there for hours, staring at the ceiling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. That's another piece of the puzzle. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Honestly, dear, I'm usually a fairly cheerful person. But lately...I've been a bit more irritable, I suppose. And...I don't know...down. Not depressed, exactly, but just...less enthusiastic about things. Everything feels like such a chore. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel that way given your symptoms. Increased irritability and a general lack of enthusiasm can be associated with fatigue and potential nutritional deficiencies. Okay, Candis, I'm going to do a brief physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a dentist appointment next week, and I don’t want to be too tired to remember what they say. But don’t poke around too much. I don't like being touched.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing concerning at the moment. Your heart and lungs sound good, although your heart rate is a bit faster than usual. Your abdomen is soft, but you do have some tenderness in the lower left quadrant. It's mild, but I'll make a note of it. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It’s been there on and off for a while, I haven’t bothered mentioning it. It's nothing, really. Old age, probably. Everything aches when you get old. But if you insist...yes, it’s a little uncomfortable when you press there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for letting me know. It's good that you brought that to my attention. Mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant can be related to various things, and we'll keep it in mind when reviewing your blood test results. Alright, Candis, I've completed the physical exam. Now, we'll need to draw some blood for the tests. It'll just be a quick prick of the finger. Do you have any issues with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: No, I don't bleed easily. I cut myself cooking sometimes, but it stops pretty quick. Honestly, I’m ready to get this over with. The sooner I know what's wrong, the sooner I can… well, I don't know what I can do, but something. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this done quickly then. Alright, all done. Please keep this bandage on for about 15 minutes to prevent any bleeding. The lab should have the results back in a few days. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a prescription for a multivitamin with iron. It won't solve everything, but it can help boost your iron levels while we wait for the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A multivitamin? Fine. Anything is better than nothing, I suppose. Will it make me stop craving dirt? That's all I really care about. And no, I don't think I have any questions. Just get me the results quickly. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'm hoping the multivitamin and addressing any potential iron deficiency will help reduce your cravings. It’s not a guarantee, but it's a good starting point. My nurse will call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Candis. I appreciate your honesty and patience. .
PATIENT: .
