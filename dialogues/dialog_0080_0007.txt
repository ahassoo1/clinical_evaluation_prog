DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, welcome. I’m Crystale Rosanova, one of the doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It is nice to meet you as well. I am here because I am experiencing some pain. I would like to get it looked at, if you please. I don’t have much time, so if we could be quick, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lakiya, I understand. We’ll get right to it. Pain… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is in my back. Lower back, specifically. It started… let me see… about three weeks ago, I believe. It was a dull ache at first, but it has gotten worse. Now, it is… sharp, sometimes. Especially when I bend over. I do a lot of work with fences, you see. It’s… physical labor.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of lower back pain, starting as a dull ache and progressing to sharp pain, especially with bending. And you do a lot of physical labor with fences… that’s helpful to know. Can you describe where exactly in your lower back the pain is?
PATIENT: It is… on both sides, mostly. But the right side is worse. If you drew a line across my lower back, about where your belt would sit… it is centered there, but it radiates outwards, you see? More to the right, though. It feels like… a muscle pulled, sometimes. Other times, it’s a deeper ache, like in my bone. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, centered around the belt line, radiating to both sides but worse on the right. Describing it as both a muscle pull and a deep bone ache… that gives me a better picture. Does anything relieve the pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Not much, truthfully. Resting helps, a little. But I have work to do. And sitting for too long isn't good either, it gets stiff. Sometimes… a warm bath. But that doesn't last. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the white pills… ibuprofen, I think? They didn’t do much good, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting and warm baths offer some temporary relief, but it’s not lasting. Ibuprofen wasn't effective. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. My legs feel… fine. Strong enough. I walk and stand all day, like I said with the fences. No weakness that I've noticed. Everything feels normal there, thankfully. I wouldn’t be able to do my job if that were the case.
DOCTOR: Good. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any back pain like this before?
PATIENT: Yes, a few times. Not this bad, though. Maybe… five years ago, something similar. It went away on its own after a week or so. I just thought I pulled something. This time it is lasting much longer. And it’s… more intense. I haven’t had to miss work before because of back pain, but I am starting to worry I might.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of similar, but less severe, episodes that resolved on their own. That's helpful. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I don’t go to the doctor often. I had some trouble with my heart, years ago… when my husband was still alive. But that was… a long time ago. I have Medicare, if that matters. They did some tests then, but I don’t remember what they were. Nothing serious now, though. I feel otherwise healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, some past heart issues years ago, but currently feeling otherwise healthy. Medicare is good to know. And you said “some tests,” do you recall if they ever gave you a diagnosis related to your heart, or what the tests were looking for?
PATIENT: No, I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and things were… difficult then. I just remember going to a lot of appointments. They gave me some pills, but I don't take them anymore. It was just… a check-up, I think. Not a major problem. Honestly, I don’t like to dwell on the past. I just want this back pain gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to dwell on it if it’s not a current issue. Okay, let’s move on. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones regularly?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Just the ibuprofen sometimes, when the pain gets bad. But I told you, it doesn't do much. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My mother always said, "Let the body heal itself." I try to live by that.
DOCTOR: That’s a good philosophy. Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life. Never had a reaction. Nothing comes to mind. I think that's everything, Doctor. I hope we can get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for that information, Lakiya. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have fences to mend.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie down on your stomach, that would be perfect. I’ll start by gently feeling along your spine and the muscles around your back. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, so I’m starting right here… any pain with this light touch?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there. That spot. It’s… a sharp pain. Not unbearable, but definitely noticeable. It’s worse when you press down. And… it radiates a little bit to the right. Just like I told you.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I’m going to gently move my fingers along the muscles on either side of your spine… any tenderness or pain as I do this?
PATIENT: Yes, on the right side. It’s tight. Feels like a knot. And again, that radiating pain. It’s not constant, but it’s there. It feels… inflamed. I can feel the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some muscle spasm and guarding on the right side, as you described. Now, I'm going to have you slowly bend forward, reaching towards your toes. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Let me know if you feel any pain or if anything feels restricted. I’ll be watching your range of motion.
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… uncomfortable. It’s the lower back again. The right side. It feels like something is… pulling. It’s difficult to go all the way down. I can’t reach my toes anymore, not without a lot of pain. I used to be able to, before this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Limited range of motion, with pain on forward flexion. Now, can you slowly rotate your torso to the right, keeping your hips stable?
PATIENT: That’s… worse than bending. A sharp pain right there, in the lower back. And… it feels like something is… clicking. A little pop, maybe. It’s not a good feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with rotation and a possible click. Finally, let's do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to lightly touch your feet with this, and let me know if you feel that.
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Both feet. No problem there. Feels normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sensation is intact. And can you please lift each leg straight up while lying on your back?
PATIENT: I can lift them both, but the right one is harder. It feels… weaker. And there’s pain in my back when I do that. It’s not a complete weakness, but it’s definitely noticeable. It’s… straining something.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Slight weakness with right leg raise and pain. Alright, Lakiya, that was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain, potentially with some facet joint irritation. The clicking I felt could be a minor instability, but we'll need to rule out other possibilities. The weakness in your leg raise is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A muscle strain? Is that… serious? And what is a facet joint? I just want to know if I can still work, if I can still mend my fences. That’s all I really care about. The weakness worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and that's a very reasonable question. A muscle strain itself isn't usually serious in the sense of life-threatening, but it can be debilitating and take time to heal. A facet joint is one of the small joints in your spine that helps with movement and stability. It sounds like it might be irritated. The weakness is the part that I want to investigate a little further. It could be related to the strain, or it could be something else. I’m going to order some X-rays of your lower back to rule out any fractures or other structural problems. And I would like to order an MRI as well, to get a better look at the soft tissues – muscles, ligaments, nerves – and see what’s going on with the weakness. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity, like mending fences. That will only make things worse. I can prescribe you some muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays and an MRI… that sounds… complicated. How long will that take? And what if it is something serious? I don’t want to be laid up for weeks. As for the pills, yes, that’s fine. Anything to help with the pain. But I still need to work. What if the pills don’t work?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. The X-rays are quick - usually a 10-15 minute procedure. The MRI will take longer – about 30-45 minutes – and we’ll need to schedule that appointment. It might be a week or so before we can get you in, depending on availability. I know it's a lot, but it’s better to be thorough and rule out anything serious. If it is something more than a simple strain, knowing what it is allows us to come up with the best treatment plan. As for the pills, they don’t work for everyone, and we can adjust the dosage or try different medications if needed. We'll start with a low dose muscle relaxant and a standard anti-inflammatory. If those don’t help, we can explore other options. In the meantime, I can give you a note for work explaining your limitations. I can also refer you to a physical therapist, who can teach you some exercises to help strengthen your back and prevent future injuries. Would you like me to write up those prescriptions and the work note now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The prescriptions and the work note. And… the referral to the physical therapist. I suppose I need to do what I have to do. But I still need to know… how long will I be able to work, even with the pills? Is it days? Weeks? Months? Just give me a realistic answer, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've got those printed for you. Here's the work note, explaining your limitations to light duty only – no heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activity. And here are the prescriptions – a muscle relaxant to be taken three times a day and an anti-inflammatory once daily. Now, regarding how long you’ll be able to work… that’s difficult to say definitively without the results of the X-rays and MRI. A typical muscle strain can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to heal. However, because of the weakness you’re experiencing and the duration of your symptoms, it’s likely to be on the longer end of that spectrum. Realistically, if it's "just" a strain, you're looking at 2-4 weeks of limited duty, with a gradual return to full activity. But, until we get those imaging results, it's impossible to rule out something more serious, and that could extend that timeframe. The physical therapist can help you assess your progress and prevent re-injury. I know that’s not the answer you want to hear, but I want to be honest with you. It’s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll get those filled and see what happens. I hope it’s nothing serious. I really do. I’ll be in touch with the clinic to schedule the X-ray and MRI, then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. And remember, listen to your body. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
