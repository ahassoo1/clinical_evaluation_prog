DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me here? Let me think… It’s my tummy, I think. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. Everything just… sits there. It’s been a little while, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve noticed some changes in your abdomen – feeling of fullness, a sense of bloating, and a decreased appetite. And you’ve been experiencing this for some time, although it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how long. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll work through it together. To help me understand things better, could you describe the feeling of “big” in your tummy a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. “Big”... It’s not painful, not really. Just… full. Like I ate a very big dinner, but I didn’t. It’s… hard, maybe? Not rock hard, but not soft like it used to be. And it feels… tight. Like a balloon, almost. I don’t know if that makes sense. I just feel… different down there.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. McConnon. A feeling of fullness, a sense of hardness, and tightness – that’s helpful information. And you haven’t experienced any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes a little… uncomfortable. Like when you eat too much, you know? But not sharp pain. Just… a dull feeling. And it comes and goes, I think. Sometimes it’s worse than others. It’s hard to say for sure, though. My days all sort of… blend together.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like intermittent discomfort, more of a fullness or pressure rather than sharp pain. We’ll certainly take that into consideration. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Well… not much has changed there, I don’t think. Maybe a little… less? I used to go every day, regular as clockwork. Now it’s… sometimes every other day. Sometimes longer. It's not… difficult, though. Just… not as often. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Ms. McConnon. A change in bowel habits, even a decrease in frequency, is something we need to note. Less frequent bowel movements can be related to a number of things. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or a change in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood? No, no blood. I don’t think so. I always look, you know, just to be sure. Everything looks… normal, I guess. Brown. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on what I ate. But no blood. And no… funny smells either. Everything seems… regular in that way. I hope that’s good.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. McConnon. No blood or unusual changes in stool color or odor is reassuring. Now, let’s talk about your appetite a bit more. You mentioned not wanting to eat as much. Has your weight changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my weight… I used to weigh more, I think. But I don’t really… weigh myself anymore. It’s not important to me. I feel… smaller, maybe? My clothes are a little looser. But I don’t know how much. I haven’t stepped on a scale in a long time. I just don’t feel hungry like I used to. Everything tastes… bland, even the things I like.
DOCTOR: I understand. A decrease in appetite and unintentional weight loss, along with a diminished sense of taste, are all things we need to consider. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… That’s a long time ago. Let me see… I had a bad flu once, a very bad one. And I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. The doctor always told me I was a healthy woman, very strong. I used to work very hard, you know. I was a sociologist, studied people. I don’t remember any… big illnesses or anything. I’m sorry, Doctor, my memory isn’t good.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. A history of a bad flu and a broken arm is helpful to know. It’s good that you were generally healthy throughout your life. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… No, I don't believe so. Not that I remember. I had a tooth pulled once, does that count? But that was a very long time ago. I always tried to stay away from doctors, if I could help it. I didn't like hospitals. Too many sick people. No, no surgeries, I'm pretty sure. Just the tooth.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries other than the tooth extraction. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's a hard one. My parents are… gone now. A long, long time ago. I had a brother, but we lost touch when we were young. He went to America, I think. I don't know much about their health, to be honest. They didn't talk about it much. I think my mother had… problems with her tummy, maybe? But I don't remember exactly what. It was a long time ago, and I was just a little girl then. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s understandable that you don’t have much information about your family history. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I live alone. Always have, really. Never married, never had children. I liked my independence. I have a nice little apartment, not fancy, but cozy. I get by. I have a few friends, but they are… older, like me. We don’t see each other very often anymore. It’s hard to get around these days. Mostly, I keep to myself. Read books, listen to music. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: I understand. A quiet life, enjoying books and music. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. And very little alcohol. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. Not anymore, though. It doesn't taste good anymore, and it makes me feel… funny. I always thought it was best to stay away from things like that. Not good for you, you know. No, I don’t smoke or drink. Not really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or alcohol use. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. I don’t think so. Nothing that I know of. I had a rash once, when I was a little girl, from poison ivy, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I haven’t taken much medication in my life, just a little something for a headache sometimes. I always tried to avoid it, if I could. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I hope that’s not a problem, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all, Ms. McConnon. No known allergies is helpful to know. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and gently examining your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. It’s alright. Just… be gentle, please. My tummy is a little sensitive, you know. Go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Alright, Ms. McConnon. Your heart and lungs sound reasonably good, though your breath sounds are a little quiet, which is common with age. Your abdomen is slightly distended and tender to the touch in the lower area, but there are no hard lumps or anything concerning. It does feel a bit full. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to check your overall health and kidney and liver function. I also want to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infection. Finally, I’d like to order an abdominal CT scan to get a better look at your abdominal organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… a CT scan… That sounds… serious. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust you. Whatever you think is best. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And I hope it doesn’t hurt. Yes, alright. Order the tests. But please, be as quick as you can. And tell me what it all means, when you get the results. I don’t understand all those medical words.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I understand your concerns. The tests are necessary to get a clearer picture of what's going on, and I will explain everything to you in plain language, I promise. The blood tests will just involve a small sample of blood, and the stool test will require a small sample of your stool. The CT scan is a painless imaging test that will take about 20-30 minutes. I’m going to write you a referral for the lab and imaging center, and their staff will be able to schedule your appointments. They will also let you know how to prepare for the tests. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, and bananas – and plenty of fluids. It might help with the fullness you’re experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A bland diet… toast and bananas… I used to love a good roast dinner, you know. But alright, if that’s what I need to do. Hmm… questions… Yes, one. Will these tests… will they tell me what’s wrong? Will they find out why my tummy is so big and why I don’t feel hungry anymore? And… is it something serious, Doctor? I’m scared, you know. It's just... getting old isn’t easy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly natural to be scared, and I want to assure you that we’re going to do everything we can to find out what’s going on. The tests will help us to determine the cause of your symptoms – the fullness, decreased appetite, and abdominal distension. It could be something relatively minor, such as a change in your diet or a mild digestive issue. However, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. The CT scan will give us a detailed look at your abdominal organs and help us to identify any abnormalities. At this stage, it’s too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious. We need to wait for the test results before we can make any conclusions. But I want to assure you that we’ll be here every step of the way, and we’ll discuss all of your options and answer any questions you may have. I’ll give you a call as soon as the test results are available, and we can schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please don’t hesitate to contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll try to stay positive and eat my toast and bananas. And I’ll wait for your call. It’s… a relief to know someone is looking after me. Thank you. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I'm here for you, and we’ll get through this together. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. Here are the referrals for the lab and imaging center, and a summary of the instructions for the bland diet. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
