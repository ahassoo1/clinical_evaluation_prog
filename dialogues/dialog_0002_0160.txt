DOCTOR: Hi Candis, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s just… I’m tired. Really tired. And it’s getting worse, if you can believe it. And… well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but… enough that I thought I should probably mention it. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. It’s good that you are mentioning it – no need to be embarrassed, we're here to figure things out together. Tiredness getting worse is definitely something we need to look into, and…eating dirt, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Don’t look at me like that! It… it just tastes good sometimes. And it helps, a little. I don’t know why, I just… do it. It started a few months ago, and now I’m craving it almost daily. It’s not like I’m shoveling it in, but it’s enough to worry me, and honestly, my energy is just… gone. I used to be able to do everything, and now… well, now I need a nap just to get through the grocery store.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for being so open with me, Candis. It is helpful to know all of this. Craving dirt, especially if it's increasing, is something we need to explore. It's called pica, and it can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. First, let’s talk about this tiredness. Can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Nutritional… what now? Look, I eat perfectly fine. I’ve always taken care of myself. I don't need a lecture about my diet. As for the tiredness… it’s just… everything feels like wading through mud. No energy, no motivation. I sleep, but it doesn’t help. I wake up feeling just as exhausted as when I went to bed. It’s affecting everything. I can barely keep up with my work, and I used to be so active. It's… frustrating. And it's not just physical, you know? It’s… mental fatigue too. Hard to think straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis, and I'm not here to lecture you. We just need to rule things out. Pica can happen even with a good diet, sometimes it's related to iron, zinc, or other deficiencies. Okay, so mental fatigue as well as physical tiredness. That’s important to know. And you said it’s been getting worse – over how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It really started to get bad around… February, maybe? January at the latest. It was gradual at first, just feeling a bit more sluggish than usual. But since then, it's been a steady decline. And the dirt craving… that started a little after that, I think. Around March? Honestly, the months all blur together these days. It’s been a long, tiring year, no matter how you slice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so February/March onset of both symptoms, gradually worsening. That gives us a good timeline. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've always been perfectly healthy. I don't take any medications, haven't had any surgeries, nothing. I used to think being stubborn was a medical condition, but my mother said it was just my personality. She was probably right. I’ve always been… robust, you know? This whole thing is very unlike me. It’s… unsettling. I pride myself on being independent, and now I'm… well, I'm here, aren't I?
DOCTOR: I understand how unsettling this must be, Candis, especially if you've always been healthy and independent. Okay, so no prior medical conditions, no medications, no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother lived to be 92, very strong woman. She had high blood pressure towards the end, but that was it. My father died young, heart attack. He didn’t take care of himself, always smoking, drinking. My brother is still alive, lives in California. He’s… okay, I guess. We don’t talk much. He’s always been a bit of a worrier, always at the doctor for something or other. Not like me. He'd probably be telling me what to do if he knew about this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother lived to 92 with high blood pressure, father died young from a heart attack, brother is alive and a worrier. That's helpful to know. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none. Absolutely none. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, touch anything, do anything. That’s always been me. I used to garden barefoot, didn’t even care. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting your time. I’m perfectly healthy, I just… eat dirt and get tired. It doesn’t make any sense!
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Candis. It doesn't sound typical, and that’s why we're investigating. Okay, so no allergies. Let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Always have. Never married, never had children. Not by choice, exactly. Just… didn't happen. I have a few friends, mostly from work, but we don't see each other much anymore. Everyone’s busy. I keep myself occupied. I garden, I read, I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven’t been going lately, not with the tiredness. It’s easier to just stay home. I have a cat, though. Her name is Cleopatra. She’s the only company I need, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, enjoy gardening and reading, and have a cat named Cleopatra. That’s nice. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, one last question. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. Oh! My skin has been… drier, I suppose. And my nails… they seem brittle. I used to have such strong nails, perfect for gardening. Now they break all the time. I’ve been using hand cream, but it doesn’t seem to help much. And… sometimes, I feel a little short of breath, just walking up the stairs. Not terrible, but noticeable. Is that important? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m listing off symptoms from a magazine. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not ridiculous at all, Candis. Those are all important things to know – dry skin, brittle nails, and shortness of breath. These things, along with the tiredness and the dirt craving, are giving us a better picture. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin and nails. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have errands to run, you know. I’m not one for lingering. And please, don’t make a fuss. I don’t need coddling. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it. I’m a practical woman. I don’t have time for… drama.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 110 over 70. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another… Good. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I’m hearing a little bit of crackling in your lungs when you breathe. That could indicate some fluid buildup. Now, let's take a look at your skin and nails. Your skin is definitely dry, and your nails are quite brittle. You also look a little pale. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to see if there are any abnormalities. Your abdomen feels normal. Alright, Candis, that gives us some initial information. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm concerned about a possible iron deficiency anemia, and we need to rule out other causes of fluid in your lungs. The dirt craving, or pica, can be a sign of iron deficiency, as can the tiredness and pale skin. The shortness of breath and crackling in your lungs need further investigation. Would you be willing to get a blood test and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Blood test and… an X-ray? Really? All this for a little tiredness and a harmless craving? It seems… excessive. But fine. If that’s what you think is necessary. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. And I expect results quickly. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for weeks. And don’t tell me it's probably nothing. I want answers. Practical answers. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Candis. I completely understand. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood today. The X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. It should only take a few minutes. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, and I'll call you as soon as I have them – hopefully within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you start taking a daily iron supplement – just over-the-counter ferrous sulfate, 325mg. And, if possible, try to increase your intake of iron-rich foods like leafy greens, red meat, and fortified cereals. While we’re waiting for the results, if you experience any increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Iron supplements… fine. And what about the dirt? Should I stop eating it? It feels… silly to even ask, but it’s been on my mind. You made it sound like that’s the whole problem, the craving, so... And emergency room? You're scaring me now. Is it that serious? I just want to feel normal again. Just tell me what's wrong and what I need to do. Don't give me vague warnings and complicated instructions. Practicality, doctor. Remember?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Candis. Yes, I would recommend stopping the dirt eating for now. It’s unlikely to be helping, and we need to see if addressing the potential iron deficiency resolves the craving. And I apologize if I caused any alarm. I don’t want to scare you, but it’s important to be thorough. The shortness of breath could indicate a more serious underlying issue, like fluid buildup in your lungs, and we need to rule that out. It’s better to be cautious, especially since you’ve been experiencing that symptom. Based on what we know so far, it's most likely an iron deficiency anemia. But we need the blood tests and X-ray to confirm that, and to rule out other possibilities. Once we have the results, we can discuss a proper treatment plan. If it is iron deficiency anemia, iron supplements and dietary changes are usually enough to resolve the issue. But we need to be sure. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just get the tests done. And call me as soon as you have the results. I have errands to run, you know. And I really don’t have time for this. Just… call me. And don't make me come back if it's nothing. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candis. I understand. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. The lab and radiology departments will be expecting you. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
