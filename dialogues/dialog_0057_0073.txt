DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It’s…it’s my stomach. Just…really bad diarrhea. Has been for weeks. Nothing seems to help, and honestly, I don't have all day to sit here and explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’ve been dealing with diarrhea for weeks, and it’s been persistent. I apologize for any delay and want to assure you I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: What more is there to say? It’s diarrhea. I go to the bathroom constantly. It’s watery, obviously. I've tried…I don’t know, those things from the pharmacy? Imodium, maybe? Doesn't do much. It just…keeps happening. Look, I'm a painter, okay? I can't be running to the toilet every hour on a job site. It's embarrassing and it’s cutting into my work. Is that enough "more" for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. It sounds very disruptive to your work, and I appreciate you explaining that. Just to clarify, you've been using Imodium without significant relief. About how many times a day are you having these bowel movements?
PATIENT: Honestly? I stopped counting. It's…a lot. More than normal, obviously. Like, six, eight times a day? Maybe more when I'm actually working. I don’t know, okay? I don't sit around cataloging my bathroom trips. It’s constant. Are you going to ask me about the color now? Because I really don’t want to talk about that.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t ask about the color right now. Six to eight times a day is quite frequent. And you mentioned it's worse when you're working – can you tell me a little more about your work?
PATIENT: I paint houses. Interior, exterior, commercial, residential…all of it. Lots of climbing ladders, being outside, different locations. It's physical work. And I'm usually with a crew, so it's not exactly…private when I have to run off to the bathroom. Look, I don’t need to give you a detailed job description. It involves being busy, okay? And constantly needing to find a toilet is a problem. I'm losing money because of this.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, physical work, being outside, and being around others makes this particularly challenging. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or anything that makes it better besides the Imodium?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Everything triggers it! Stress, being tired, eating…I don’t know! It just…happens. Nothing makes it better, honestly. That’s why I’m here! I thought maybe there was something…wrong? Some bug I picked up? I don’t sit around analyzing my diet or anything. I eat what I can when I can. I'm a painter, not a nutritionist. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, I’m not trying to quiz you on your diet, Ms. Woodring. It sounds like this has been a very frustrating experience, and it’s understandable you’re looking for answers. Since it's been going on for weeks and isn't responding to over-the-counter medication, it's good we're looking into it. To get a better picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little nauseous sometimes, but I just ignore it. No vomiting. And my stomach…it cramps a little. Not like, awful pain, just…discomfort. It's just…a constant annoyance, okay? I'm not dying here, I just want it to stop. Are we getting anywhere, or are you just going to keep asking me questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, occasional nausea, and some abdominal cramping. It sounds like it’s primarily disruptive and uncomfortable, which is still important to address. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I work locally. And exposed to sick people? It's a construction site, Doctor! People are always sick. Dust, germs, whatever. It’s part of the job. Honestly, I'm surrounded by coughing and sneezing all day. You think I keep track of who has a cold?
DOCTOR: Right, a construction site. Okay. And just to be thorough, do you have any other medical conditions, or take any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Look, I'm pretty healthy. I work hard, okay? No other conditions. And no, I don’t take any medications. Never have. Except for…when I had that surgery a few years back…after my husband passed. But that was just for a little while, and that's over with. It was a long time ago, and it wasn't…relevant. It was just…a gallbladder thing. And honestly, I'd rather not talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had your gallbladder removed a few years ago after the loss of your husband, and that was a temporary medication course. I understand you'd rather not discuss it further. Since you've been experiencing this for weeks, and it’s not resolving, I think it would be best to do a quick physical exam, and order some lab tests to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I have jobs waiting. But don't expect me to be happy about this.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll just gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. It won’t take long. Okay, your abdomen is soft, but I do notice a little bit of tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Not alarming, but good to note. No masses or guarding. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which can sometimes be associated with diarrhea. We'll need to send some stool samples to the lab to check for any infections, parasites, or other issues. I also want to check a complete blood count to rule out any inflammation or dehydration. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry up. Stool samples? Seriously? This is ridiculous. But…okay. Whatever tests you need to do. Just tell me when it'll be over and I can leave. I really don’t have time for this. And please, don’t make me talk about what’s in my stool.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I’ll keep everything as quick and efficient as possible. The nurse will give you the containers and instructions for the stool samples. It’s best to collect three separate samples over the next few days. The lab results should be back in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, it’s important to stay hydrated. Electrolyte solutions like Pedialyte or Gatorade can be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just…when can I go? And will this show up on my insurance? I don't need a huge bill on top of everything else. That’s it. Just tell me when I can leave and how much it’s going to cost.
DOCTOR: Okay. The nurse will process your insurance information and give you an estimated cost breakdown before you leave. You're free to go once she's finished that. It shouldn't be much longer. We’ve discussed the stool samples and staying hydrated. Please call the office if your symptoms worsen or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the lab results are available. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Woodring. .
