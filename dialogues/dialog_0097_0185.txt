DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time, okay? It’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, people tell me. It’s…embarrassing. I work on the highway, so it’s not like a delicate environment. Just…fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it, and it’s completely understandable to want to get it sorted quickly. It is embarrassing when something like that happens, especially with your work environment. "Fix it" is a little broad, though, so let's try to figure out why your breath smells bad. It could be a lot of different things. Do you notice it all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t really tried to notice. I mean, if someone says something, I know. It’s not like I’m oblivious. It's probably just…the food I eat. Or something. Look, I eat when I can, it’s highway work, not a picnic. Is that what you need to know? Do I need to list everything I’ve had in the last week? Because I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: No, definitely no need to list everything you've eaten! I completely understand the work situation makes regular meals tricky. It's good you're thinking about food as a possible cause. Sometimes it is just something you ate, but bad breath, or what we call halitosis, can also be caused by things like dry mouth, problems with your teeth or gums, or even something going on with your sinuses. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I don’t get sick often. I’m…tough. Look, I work outside, okay? Wind, sun, whatever. I don't sit around worrying about…symptoms. Honestly, I don't even know what you mean by symptoms. Is this going to take all day? Because I have things to do. Is it just a mouthwash thing? Can you just write me a prescription for something strong?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you being honest. Let's try this a different way. When you say you don't get sick often, that’s good. But sometimes things cause bad breath without making you feel sick. Let me ask a few quick questions, and if they don’t apply, just tell me. Have you noticed any soreness in your mouth or gums?
PATIENT: Soreness? No. I mean, sometimes I get little cuts, obviously. Rocks fly, things happen. But nothing…major. I don't sit around examining my mouth, if that's what you're asking. I patch things up and get back to work. Are you a dentist too or something? This is getting ridiculous. I came for my breath, not a full oral inspection.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not a dentist, but as your family doctor, I need to rule out some basic causes. Cuts can definitely contribute, but we need to see if anything else is going on. Okay. How about this – do you ever notice a dry feeling in your mouth, especially in the morning or after a long stretch without drinking water?
PATIENT: Dry mouth? I guess…sometimes. It's hot out there. And dusty. You drink when you can. Look, I told you, it’s highway work, not a spa day. Is this going somewhere, or are we just going to talk about the weather and my work conditions all afternoon? Just tell me if it's something I can buy at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I am getting to a point. It sounds like the dry mouth could be a factor, especially with the heat and dust. Often, dry mouth leads to bad breath. Let's do a quick check, if you don’t mind. It won’t take long. I just want to take a look inside your mouth and check your gums and teeth, just to be sure there isn't something else going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And don't tell me my teeth are dirty, okay? I brush them…sometimes. Look, I have a schedule. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick look. Your gums are a little bit red and swollen, which can be from irritation or a build-up of plaque. Your mouth is dry, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of anything major, but the gingivitis and dryness could definitely be contributing to the bad breath. I'm going to recommend a couple of things. First, try to increase your water intake throughout the day, even if it means making a conscious effort to sip water regularly. Second, I’d like you to start using a fluoride toothpaste and brush twice a day. A tongue scraper can also help remove bacteria.
PATIENT: So…brush my teeth more and drink water? That’s it? I came all the way here for that? Honestly, I could have figured that out myself. Is there anything else? Like, a mouthwash that actually works? Something strong? Because I really need to get this sorted. People are starting to avoid me. And I don’t have time for that. Just…give me something to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if it seems like simple advice, but often, that’s all it takes! The dryness and mild gum irritation are very common causes of bad breath, and addressing those can make a huge difference. As for mouthwash, yes, there are some that can help temporarily mask the odor, but they don't address the underlying cause. I recommend a therapeutic mouthwash without alcohol, as alcohol can actually worsen dryness. I can write you a prescription for one called Chlorhexidine, but it can stain your teeth with prolonged use, so it’s best used short-term. We can try that if the increased water and brushing don’t help. Let’s start with those two things – the water and brushing – for a week and see how it goes. If it doesn't improve, we can discuss the Chlorhexidine. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. A week. And if it doesn’t work, you give me the strong stuff. Don't tell me about stains. I don’t care about stains, I care about not smelling like…whatever I smell like. Write the prescription, just in case. And can I just get on with my day now? I have things to do. Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve written the prescription for Chlorhexidine, just in case. Here you go. Remember, try the increased water and brushing for a week first. If there’s no improvement, you can fill this. I’ll also print out some information on maintaining good oral hygiene and dealing with dry mouth. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…thank you. And please, don't expect me to come back for a follow-up. Just let me go. Stop.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand. Just remember, if things don’t improve, or if you notice any other symptoms, feel free to reach out. Have a good day, Zelina, and stay hydrated out there. .
