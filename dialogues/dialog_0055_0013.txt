DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s been…troublesome, lately. I have trouble… emptying my bladder all the way. It feels like there’s always a little left in there, even after I go. It’s not painful, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. A frustrating sensation, certainly. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just now and then. But the last month or so, it’s been happening almost every time I go to the bathroom. I try to… push a little harder, but it doesn't always help. It worries me a bit.
DOCTOR: Six months, progressively worsening… pushing doesn’t resolve it entirely. Do you find yourself needing to urinate more frequently than usual, or does it just feel incomplete?
PATIENT: No, not more often, Doctor. The number of times hasn’t changed. It’s just… when I do go, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out. Like there’s still some left behind, even though I try. It's hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Hilber. It suggests there may be some difficulty with complete bladder emptying. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine stream – weaker flow, straining to start, or any splitting or dribbling?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, the stream is a little weaker than it used to be. Not much, but I have noticed I have to… concentrate a bit more to get it started. And sometimes, just a little dribble after I finish. It's not a lot, but it's there. I hadn’t really thought much of it until now. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A weaker stream and post-void dribbling… those are pertinent details, Mr. Hilber. And you’ve stated no pain with urination, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. No pain at all. Just… uncomfortable, knowing there’s still some left in there. It doesn't hurt, thankfully. I just don’t want it to cause any problems later on. My wife… she passed last year, and she always took care of these things for me. I’m not so good at remembering what to ask, or what to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed, particularly with recent loss. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of diabetes, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. The doctors always checked when my wife was sick, and they didn’t say anything about that. Neurological… what does that mean, Doctor? I’m sorry, I don’t always understand the big words. I worked with shoes my whole life, not books.
DOCTOR: Neurological conditions refer to issues with your nerves, Mr. Hilber. Certain nerve problems can affect bladder function. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or weakness. My legs are fine. I still walk every day, weather permitting. Used to go fishing a lot, but it’s not the same without my wife. I can walk just as good as I always could, I think. Maybe a little slower, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. I haven’t noticed anything different with my legs.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll need to check your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. This will help me determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I don’t really like the sound of that, Doctor. But if you think it’s important… I suppose so. I just… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I really don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men, Mr. Hilber. It allows me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate, which can often contribute to these issues. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it is typically brief. I will explain each step as we go, and we can stop at any time if you are experiencing undue discomfort. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s important, and you'll explain everything… alright. But please, take it easy, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I just… don’t like surprises. And maybe afterwards you can explain what you found? I like to know what’s going on with my body.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your left side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will begin with an abdominal examination, then proceed with the digital rectal exam. Your abdomen is soft, and I do not feel any tenderness or masses. Now, I will need you to take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. This will help me relax your muscles. Okay… taking a deep breath… Your prostate is mildly enlarged, and feels somewhat firm. There are no obvious nodules. It is important to note this is a preliminary finding.
PATIENT: Mildly enlarged… and firm… is that bad, Doctor? What does that mean for me? Does it mean I need… surgery, or something? I’m getting a little worried now. My wife always knew what questions to ask, but I just… I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, an enlarged prostate is a common finding in men your age. It doesn't automatically necessitate surgery. However, the firmness is something we need to investigate further. It could indicate benign prostatic hyperplasia – a non-cancerous enlargement – but we must rule out other possibilities. I would like to order a prostate-specific antigen blood test, and a urinalysis to check for infection. I also recommend a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, including a possible prostate biopsy. This is standard procedure, Mr. Hilber, and does not mean you have cancer. It's simply a precaution to ensure we have a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A biopsy… that sounds… serious. And a PSA test… is that the blood test? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… alright. But please, explain everything to me. I don’t want any surprises. And if it is something serious… what are my options? My wife… she always liked to know all the options. I just want to be prepared. And could you write all of this down for me? I’m not so good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will document everything thoroughly. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can indicate prostate cancer, but can also be caused by other conditions like infection or benign enlargement. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of prostate tissue for examination under a microscope. It's the only definitive way to diagnose prostate cancer. If cancer is found, treatment options depend on the stage and grade of the cancer, and may include active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy. I will write a referral to Dr. Albright, a highly respected urologist in town. He will explain all of these options in detail if necessary. I am also ordering a urinalysis to rule out any infection that could be contributing to your symptoms. Here are the forms. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Albright as soon as possible, and go to the lab for the urinalysis. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all, Doctor. It’s a lot to take in. Thank you for explaining everything, even if it’s a little scary. I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Albright right away. And I’ll get the lab test done tomorrow. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
