DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Dr. Bakan, is it? Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. I need a clearance for… well, a little touch-up. The surgeon wants me to get a check-up first. It’s all rather silly, if you ask me, but rules are rules.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand you need a medical clearance for a surgical procedure. I’m happy to assist you with that. To ensure we have all the necessary information for the surgeon, I’ll need to ask you a few questions about your health history. I assure you, I’ll be as efficient as possible. To start, could you tell me what type of surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I have to? It's… cosmetic. A face lift. There, are you happy? It’s not like it’s a heart transplant. Honestly, the fuss everyone is making. It’s just to tighten things up a bit. My wife… well, she would have wanted it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for sharing that with me. Knowing the type of procedure is helpful for me to assess your overall health and potential risks. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to maintain your well-being, and I respect your decision. Now, to proceed with the clearance, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Goodness. Where do I begin? I’m 81 years old, for heaven’s sake! I’ve lived a full life. Let’s see… I had the flu, probably, a few times. And a bad back once, when I was laying terrazzo. That was years ago. No major illnesses, mind you. Never smoked, hardly drank. Mostly just sensible Norwegian living. I have… had high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but it’s under control with a little pill. That’s about it, really.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Orwin. It sounds as though you’ve led a very healthy life. You mentioned high blood pressure that is currently controlled with medication. Could you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the foggiest. My daughter handles all that now. She fills the little containers for me every week. I just… take them. It’s a white one, and a little blue one. That’s all I know. She gets it from the pharmacy, you see. I wouldn’t want to mess it up. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It’s common for patients to rely on family members for medication management. We’ll need to determine the exact name and dosage of your blood pressure medication for the clearance. Perhaps we could contact your daughter, with your permission, to obtain that information?
PATIENT: Contact her? Oh, very well. If you must. Her name is Ingrid. Ingrid Orwin. She’s a sensible girl, very sensible. Phone number… let me see. It’s… 555-123-4567. But don’t bother her too much. She’s busy. And tell her I said hello. Honestly, all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. I’ll contact Ingrid and obtain the medication information. While I’m waiting to hear back from her, let’s discuss your allergies, if any. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I suppose. Nothing serious. I ate shellfish all my life. No problems there. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. My wife used to give me everything for a headache, and I was fine. Honestly, I'm a very robust constitution.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, could you tell me about any past surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… oh, goodness, must be 60 years ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while laying tile. Nothing major. A bit of a cast, that’s all. And… I had a prostate operation, years ago. A common thing, they said. Other than that… nothing. I've been very lucky, you see.
DOCTOR: That provides a good overview, Mr. Orwin. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently use tobacco products, or have you used them in the past?
PATIENT: Tobacco? Heavens, no! Never touched the stuff. My father smoked, and he died young, you see. Ruined his lungs, they said. No, never. Always sensible living. Fresh air, good food, hard work. That's the ticket.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Orwin. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Just a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A nice red wine. Nothing excessive. My wife and I used to enjoy a glass with our meal. But nothing more than that. I don't go looking for it, you understand. It’s just… civilized.
DOCTOR: I see. Very moderate consumption. Now, finally, could you briefly describe your current level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity? Well, I don't run marathons, if that's what you're asking. I used to be very active, laying terrazzo was hard work, you know. But now… I mostly read. And I take a short walk around the block, when the weather is nice. I try to stay moving, but I’m not as spry as I used to be. Honestly, at 81, what do you expect?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That gives me a very complete picture of your health history and lifestyle. I'm just waiting to hear back from your daughter, Ingrid, regarding your blood pressure medication. In the meantime, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Get it over with, then. The sooner I get this clearance, the sooner I can get on with my life. Just… be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’ll take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Next, I'll check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Finally, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal there as well. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. We are still awaiting information from your daughter about your blood pressure medication to complete the clearance.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, you say? Good. That’s what I like to hear. As long as everything is… normal. Honestly, I knew I was fine. All this fuss for nothing. Is there anything else? Can we just get this clearance sorted out now? I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Excuse me for one moment, Mr. Orwin. It appears we have a call from Ingrid. Hello, Ingrid?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Honestly, the inefficiency of it all…
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I spoke with your daughter, Ingrid. She confirmed you are currently taking Lisinopril 20mg once daily for your high blood pressure. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril… 20mg. She keeps me well-supplied, you see. Sensible girl. So? Can we get this clearance now? Is there anything else I need to do? Honestly, I’m starting to lose my patience.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin. With the information from Ingrid, I am able to complete the medical clearance form for your upcoming facelift. Based on my examination and your medical history, I do not foresee any major medical contraindications to the procedure. However, I recommend you inform your surgeon of your slightly elevated blood pressure and continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. I will also provide you with a copy of this clearance form and a note for your surgeon outlining my findings. Here is the completed form and the note for your surgeon. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Finally! About time. No, no questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. I have a luncheon appointment to get to. And honestly, all this fuss for a little touch-up… ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I wish you a speedy recovery and a pleasant luncheon. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns in the future. Have a good day.
