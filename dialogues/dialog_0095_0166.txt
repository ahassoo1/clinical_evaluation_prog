DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though it sometimes feels… faint in the right one as well.
DOCTOR: Okay. Persistent numbness, you said. And it’s primarily in the left leg, with some occasional sensation in the right. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it doesn't feel like complete numbness, if that makes sense. More like… pins and needles, or when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t go away when I move it. It’s been going on for about three weeks now, I’d say. Started gradually, and hasn’t really improved. I haven’t had any injury that I can recall, and I haven't changed anything in my routine recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, pins and needles, doesn’t resolve with movement, about three weeks in duration, and no recent injury or change in routine. Good to know. Is the numbness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s… worse when I’ve been sitting for a long time, like when I’m working on animation projects. It seems to ease up when I walk around, but then comes back if I sit down again for too long. It’s not excruciating pain, just… very uncomfortable and distracting. It’s been making it difficult to concentrate on my work, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, worse with prolonged sitting, improves with walking, and doesn't cause severe pain, but is distracting. Animation work, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a special effects artist and animator – mostly freelance, so I do a lot of my work from home. It involves long hours at my computer, which I suppose could be contributing. I do try to take breaks and stretch, but sometimes deadlines… well, you understand. Do you need to know what kind of animation? I work with both 2D and 3D, mostly character animation.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. And yes, long hours at the computer is certainly something we'll consider. Now, besides your leg, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I haven’t noticed anything else physically. No weakness in the leg, no changes in bowel or bladder control, no fever or chills… I suppose I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to working long hours as well. Nothing that would immediately stand out, no. Do you have a specific symptom in mind?
DOCTOR: No, no specific symptom. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, no weakness, no bowel/bladder changes, no fever, just some fatigue. Have you had any back pain at all, even mild?
PATIENT: Back pain… that’s interesting. I hadn’t thought of that. I do sometimes get a bit of stiffness in my lower back, especially after a long day working. It’s not sharp pain, more like a dull ache. I usually just stretch it out, and it feels better. I don't think I've ever considered it anything serious. Is that what you were thinking of?
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness and a dull ache in the lower back. That is helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've been generally healthy my whole life, thankfully. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries… I had the usual childhood vaccinations, and I get annual checkups with my primary care physician, but nothing significant has ever come up. I don’t take any medications regularly. I do have private insurance through my work, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, no surgeries, up to date on vaccinations, no medications. That’s good to know. What about family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit more complicated. My mother’s side has a history of… well, a lot of vague complaints, honestly. Arthritis, mostly. And my grandfather had something with his nerves, I believe, but I don't have the specifics. It was a long time ago, and my mother doesn’t remember much detail. My father’s side is healthier, as far as I know. He and his siblings have mostly had standard age-related issues. I don’t believe there’s any history of neurological conditions on that side. Does that help? It’s a little fragmented, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of arthritis and some nerve issues on the mother's side, generally healthy father's side. That's alright, we work with what we have. And finally, just a couple quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to maintain a pretty healthy lifestyle otherwise. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, and I try to get some exercise when I can, though work sometimes makes that difficult. Mostly walking and hiking when I have the time. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, very healthy lifestyle. That’s good. Alright, Tarin. Given what you’ve told me – the numbness in your leg, worsening with sitting, improvement with walking, lower back stiffness, and your healthy lifestyle – it sounds like this could be related to nerve compression, possibly from sitting for long periods. We'll need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’d like to figure out what’s going on. A physical exam sounds good. Please, proceed when you're ready. Let me know if there's anything I should do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. No preparation needed. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. I’ll also palpate your lower back to check for tenderness. It may be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything is particularly painful. First, can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tarin. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs. I’m going to gently tap on your tendons. This will assess your nerve function. Okay… reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m trying to apply a good amount of pressure. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Good strength throughout. Now, let's test your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton ball. Tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes for this part. Okay… can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. Right there… and there… and now… here. It feels the same everywhere, no tingling or numbness when you touch me. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, sensation is intact. Good. Now, I'm going to palpate your lower back. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little bit there. Right around… here. Not sharp pain, more like a dull ache, like the stiffness I was describing. It’s not constant, just when you press on it. Everything else feels alright. It’s… localized to that spot, though. Is that significant?
DOCTOR: Okay, localized tenderness in the lower back, consistent with your description. That's helpful. Alright, Tarin. Based on the physical exam, it appears we are dealing with a possible lumbar strain or mild nerve irritation. However, to rule out more serious causes, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. I understand. Ordering tests is a sensible precaution. What kind of tests are you thinking about? I'd like to know what to expect. And please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for them.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the nerves and soft tissues. And I'll also order some basic blood work to rule out any inflammation or underlying medical conditions. The MRI doesn't require any special preparation, but please let the technician know if you have any metal implants. And for the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except water. The lab will give you specific instructions when they schedule the appointment. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. No metal implants, thankfully. And fasting for 8-12 hours is no problem at all. I can easily work that into my schedule. When should I expect to hear from the lab to schedule those appointments? And will you be reviewing the results directly, or will I need to follow up with another physician?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The lab should contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the appointments. And yes, I will be reviewing the results directly. Once I have the results, I'll call you to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms, like prolonged sitting. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if needed. And gentle stretching exercises can be helpful, but avoid any movements that cause pain. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding prolonged sitting, over-the-counter pain relievers if needed, and gentle stretching… I can definitely manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Any warning signs I should look out for that would warrant immediate attention?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Tarin. That’s what I'm here for. Now, if you experience any of the following, please seek immediate medical attention: severe weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or any numbness that spreads to your groin or buttocks. These could indicate a more serious condition. Otherwise, we’ll wait for the test results and take it from there. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very comprehensively. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. I'll follow your instructions and schedule the tests as soon as possible. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. You’re very welcome, Tarin. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Get in touch with the lab, and we'll see you back here once the results are available. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for your help. I will, and I appreciate your time. Have a good day too. .
