DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it's this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes and goes, you see. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off? Something about my muscles. Honestly, I don't keep up with all that. It's just… draining. I used to be able to do anything. Commercial diving isn't for the faint of heart, you know. But now… It's not the same.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For… oh, decades. Well, not right now, of course. I'm retired. My husband, he always worried so. Said it was too dangerous for a woman. Still, I was good at it. Very good. We did salvage mostly. And some inspections. Though I don't recall exactly what kind anymore. It was a long time ago. All this fatigue makes it hard to think clearly, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this fatigue… when did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. It started… slowly. Maybe six months ago? Or was it eight? It’s hard to say. It comes in waves. Some days I feel… well, not good, exactly, but able to get around. Other days… I just want to lie in bed. It's not like being sleepy, though. It's more like… everything is heavy. Even thinking is heavy. It's just… a weakness. A draining weakness.
DOCTOR: And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Though… well, my daughter-in-law has been trying to get me to do these… “exercises.” All that bending and stretching. Honestly, it just makes me feel more tired. And achy. It’s probably that. All that movement. I was perfectly fine before she started fussing with me. Young people think they know everything, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the fatigue and the feeling of weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, my muscles have been a bit… sore, I suppose. Not a sharp pain, just… dull. And I’ve been having trouble getting up from chairs. It’s embarrassing, really. Used to be able to spring right up. Now… I need a little help sometimes. My husband mostly does it, but he complains. Says I need to be more careful. Honestly, it's just old age creeping in, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I haven't really been hungry, no. Not like I used to be. I eat a little, because my husband worries. He makes a lovely stew, you see. But I don't enjoy it as much. As for weight… I suppose I've lost a little. My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven't stepped on a scale in ages. Scales are just depressing, you know. Best not to dwell on those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I take a little something for my blood pressure. My husband reminds me. A tiny white pill, I think. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just when it really bothers me, you understand. And… Oh! My daughter-in-law gave me some vitamins. Something about boosting my energy. I take those sometimes, but honestly, I can’t tell if they do anything. She buys them from the internet, you know. All sorts of things in them. I don't keep up with all that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I’ve always been quite hardy, you see. Never much bothered by anything. My husband says I have a strong constitution. Though… I did have a rash once, many years ago, after eating some shellfish. But that was a long time ago. And it wasn't a bad rash, just a bit itchy. I’m pretty sure it was just something I ate. Not a true allergy. People are always making too much fuss about allergies these days, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a little strength test. That's just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. As long as it doesn't involve too much… exertion. I don't want to tire myself out. And please don't make me do any of those hopping things. My knees aren't what they used to be. Do let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as young as I once was, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just relax, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, although a little faint. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you please let your arms relax?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Relax, you say? It’s hard to relax when you’re being poked and prodded, you know. But I’m trying. Go ahead, Doctor. Just be careful. Oh! That tickles. Is that normal? Are you supposed to feel that? It’s not painful, exactly, but… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s perfectly normal to feel a slight tickle. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Squeeze? My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be, you know. All that diving… it was good exercise, but it takes its toll. Is that enough? It’s not very strong, I’m afraid. Perhaps I should have done those exercises my daughter-in-law suggested. Though I doubt it would make much difference. These old muscles just aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is diminished bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Oitker, that's enough for the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing generalized weakness and fatigue. The diminished reflexes and grip strength are also concerning. Now, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and muscle inflammation. It’s a pretty standard panel. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh dear. I don't like needles. Never have. And all that poking and prodding… it makes me feel faint. But… if it will help me feel better, I suppose I can manage. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And you’ll be gentle, won’t you? And please, tell me beforehand when you’re going to poke me. I don't like surprises. Will it hurt terribly? And will I be able to go home afterward?
DOCTOR: It will be as quick and gentle as possible, Ms. Oitker. The phlebotomist is very skilled. You’ll barely feel a pinch. Yes, you'll absolutely be able to go home afterward. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw, and then we'll send the samples to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. I'll call you as soon as they are in, and we can discuss them. I'm also going to order a Vitamin D level check. It's very common for people to be deficient, and that can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible. And stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Vitamin D, you say? I don’t spend much time in the sun. My husband worries about my skin. Always telling me to wear a hat and sunscreen. Maybe that’s it! A lack of sunshine. Though I doubt it’s that simple. Rest, you say? Easier said than done. My mind is always racing. And I worry so much. Yes, I do have a question. Will these tests tell me why I’m so tired? Will they find something wrong? I don't want anything serious. I just want to feel like myself again. And… what if they do find something wrong? What then?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us narrow down the possible causes of your fatigue. They won't necessarily give us a definitive answer right away, but they will give us valuable information. As for what if we do find something wrong, that depends on what it is. We'll discuss all of your options and create a plan to help you feel better. It's important to remember that many things can cause fatigue, and it's often treatable. We’ll take things one step at a time. We'll start with the blood tests, and then we'll go from there. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. Do you have any allergies to latex, or any trouble with your veins?
PATIENT: Latex? No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with it. And my veins… They’re a bit… tricky, I’m afraid. Nurses always have trouble finding them. They’re small, and they move around. I always feel faint when they poke me, even if they find it quickly. Perhaps you should use the small needle? And be very gentle, please. I’m not very good with needles, you see. It’s… a lifelong phobia. Honestly, just thinking about it makes me feel dizzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. We’ll make sure to use the smallest needle possible, and I'll let the phlebotomist know to take their time and be very gentle. I'll be right here with you during the blood draw, and we can stop at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Let me write a note to the lab regarding your difficult veins and needle phobia. Alright, I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Knowing you’ll be there makes me feel a bit better. Honestly, just being understood is a relief. No, I don't think so. Just… please don't let them poke me too much. And tell them I bruise easily. My daughter-in-law always complains about it. It’s just one thing after another, you see. And… perhaps a glass of water after the tests? Just in case I feel faint. That would be lovely. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I'll make sure they’re aware of your bruising tendency. And yes, absolutely, I’ll have a glass of water waiting for you after the blood draw. I'll go ahead and let the lab technician know you're ready. They should be in shortly. Please just relax, and take a few deep breaths. We’ll get through this. I’ll be right back. Let me know if you need anything in the meantime.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try. Just… hurry, please. I don’t like being alone. .
