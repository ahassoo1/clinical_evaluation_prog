DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. The pleasure is mine. I… well, it is difficult to explain. I am noticing… gaps. In my remembering. It is quite concerning, and my blood pressure has been… elevated, they tell me. I want to understand what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. “Gaps” in your remembering and elevated blood pressure – those are certainly things we want to investigate. It’s good you're addressing this promptly. To help me understand what’s going on, let’s start with the memory concerns. Could you describe these "gaps" a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… small things, mostly. Like, I will go to the kitchen to get something – tea, usually – and completely forget what I was going to get. Or I will be speaking with someone, and the word… it escapes me. Not often, but enough to make me worry. I remember details very well, dates, names… but the immediate things? They slip away. It is very frustrating. And… a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulties with recent memory, specifically with recalling things as they happen or shortly after. That's a valid concern, and we need to explore the potential causes. You mentioned remembering dates and names well – that’s helpful information. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. It… started, I think, maybe six months ago? Small things at first, easily dismissed. But it has become… more noticeable in the last three months, perhaps. It is not constant, not every day, but frequent enough to be unsettling. And, as I said, my doctor mentioned my blood pressure. He said it could be… related? I do not understand these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with increasing frequency over the last three months. That’s helpful to know. And yes, your doctor is right to consider a potential relationship with your blood pressure. Hypertension can sometimes affect cognitive function. To further clarify things, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have been… quite healthy, all my life, really. A little arthritis in my knees, but that is all. My late husband, he had some heart trouble, but I did not inherit that, thankfully. No diabetes, no thyroid… nothing. I take a vitamin D supplement, that is all. And sometimes, for my knees, ibuprofen, when the pain is bad.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Alvara. So, generally healthy with only mild arthritis and occasional ibuprofen use. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I have avoided them, if possible. A few stitches when I was a child, falling from a tree, but nothing… serious. No major surgeries. I believe in letting the body heal itself, when it can. Though, I understand sometimes it is necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… complicated. My mother, she lived to a very old age, but she did have… confusion, towards the end. The doctors said it was age, mostly. My father, he died young, from an accident. No history of dementia, as far as I know. My brother, he is still alive, but we are not close. I do not know much about his health. I… I do not believe there were any significant issues, but I cannot say for certain. It is… not a family that talks about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for families to not discuss health matters openly. We’ll work with what you know. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I have never smoked. I used to enjoy a small glass of red wine with dinner, occasionally, but I stopped… about a year ago. My doctor suggested it, for my blood pressure. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I find them… distasteful. I prefer tea. Earl Grey, usually.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Alvara. Avoiding those substances is certainly beneficial. One last question about your social history: How would you describe your level of social activity and stress in your life?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… difficult. Since my husband passed, it has been… quiet. I live alone. I have a few friends, we meet for tea sometimes, or go to the theatre. But it is not the same. I used to be very involved in the community association, organizing events, helping others. But I found it… too stressful after he died. So I withdrew. It is peaceful, living alone, but… lonely. Stress? Not much, physically. But emotionally… yes, there is loneliness. And a constant… worry. About forgetting, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and the loneliness and worry are understandably contributing factors. Now, let's move on to some basic questions about your current symptoms. Besides the memory lapses, are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with speech or balance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. No headaches, no dizziness. My vision is… not perfect, I need glasses, as you can see. But it has been that way for years. No weakness, no numbness, no trouble speaking. My balance is… fine. I walk perfectly well. It is only the memory. That is the only thing. Though… sometimes, I feel… a little lost. As if I am not fully present, if that makes sense. But it passes quickly.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Alvara. It’s helpful to know about that. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, sensation, and coordination. We’ll also listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand it is necessary. Please, proceed. I am ready. I want to understand what is happening, and I trust your judgment. I would like to be finished as quickly as possible, if that is not asking too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I will be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is elevated, as your previous doctor noted. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your strength and reflexes are normal. Your sensation is intact. I did note some mild difficulty with the heel-to-shin test on your left side, which suggests some slight coordination issue. It is not alarming, but it is something to note. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not yet. The… slight coordination issue… is that concerning? I do not… feel clumsy, or anything. I simply noticed I sometimes forget what I was going to do, or where I was going. Is that related? Is this something serious? I am starting to feel… anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly natural to feel worried when experiencing these symptoms. The mild coordination issue is not, in and of itself, immediately alarming. It could be due to a variety of factors, and we need to investigate further to determine the cause. As for whether it’s related to your memory lapses, it could be. At this point, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. These tests will include a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We will also test for glucose to rule out diabetes. I would also like to order an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any other potential causes for your memory problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. Is that really necessary? I do not understand why I need so many tests. It is simply a little forgetting, is it not? I am a widow, Doctor. I do not have anyone to help me with these things. And the cost… I am not insured, you see. Perhaps it is simply stress? Or old age? I do not wish to go through many… procedures, if it is not truly necessary.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. You are right to ask questions and express your worries. An MRI is not something I order lightly. However, given your symptoms – the memory lapses, the slight coordination issue, and the elevated blood pressure – it’s the most effective way to rule out any serious underlying causes. It could be something benign, like age-related changes or stress, but we need to be certain. We want to make sure we are not missing anything that requires prompt treatment. Regarding your lack of insurance, I understand that is a significant concern. Our clinic does offer a payment plan option for patients without insurance. I can have our financial counselor speak with you to discuss the costs and options available. Would you be open to speaking with the financial counselor?
PATIENT: A payment plan… that might be acceptable. If there is no other way. But… what if it is something terrible? I am an old woman, Doctor. I have lived a long life. I do not wish to undergo… difficult treatments, if there is nothing to be done. Is there a chance it is simply… stress? Or a natural decline? I worry constantly, and I sleep poorly. Perhaps that is all it is?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Alvara. It is possible that your symptoms are related to stress, sleep deprivation, or natural age-related changes. However, it's crucial to rule out other potential causes first. Stress and poor sleep can certainly contribute to memory problems and cognitive difficulties. But we need to exclude possibilities like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, early signs of dementia, or less common neurological conditions. If the tests come back normal, we can focus on strategies to manage your stress, improve your sleep, and support your cognitive health. Those strategies might include relaxation techniques, cognitive exercises, and lifestyle changes. If the tests do reveal an underlying condition, we will discuss the findings with you in detail and explore the best course of treatment. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood tests?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Order the tests. If it must be done. But please, do not keep me waiting long for the results. I do not wish to live in constant worry. And… yes, please have the financial counselor speak with me. I need to understand the costs. And… thank you, Doctor. For your patience. I am a difficult patient, I know.
DOCTOR: You are not a difficult patient at all, Ms. Alvara. You are a patient who is understandably concerned about her health, and you are asking important questions. That’s a good thing. I will order the blood tests right away. The results typically take 2-3 business days. Our office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will also have our financial counselor reach out to you today to discuss payment options. In the meantime, please try to get as much rest as possible and avoid unnecessary stress. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with speech, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. I… I simply want to know what is happening, and to find some peace. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I understand your desire for answers and peace of mind. We will do everything we can to help you achieve that. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
