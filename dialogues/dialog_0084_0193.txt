DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Voytek. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. Too much gas, you understand? It is… embarrassing, honestly. It has been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be embarrassing, yes. We'll figure it out. “A little while now”… can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Perhaps… three months? Maybe a little longer. It started after I tried a new kind of bean. A black bean, I believe. Though, it still happens even when I do not eat beans now. It is… persistent. I try to be polite, but it is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, starting around when you tried the black beans, but continuing even without them. And it’s impacting your daily life, making it difficult to be comfortable. Alright. Besides the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me consider. Sometimes… my stomach feels a little bloated. And… a little bit of cramping, but not terrible pain. Just… uncomfortable. No… nothing else, really. I eat normally. I sleep normally. Everything else is as it should be, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and some cramping alongside the gas. And those started around the same time as the gas, roughly three months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Roughly three months ago. When the gas started, the bloating and cramping followed shortly after. It all began… after the black beans. I truly believe those beans are the source of this trouble, even if it continues now without them. Perhaps my system was… shocked.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing, really. I have Medicare, so they check me up regularly, but everything is always… normal. I do not take any medications, and I have no allergies that I am aware of. I try to stay healthy, you see. I walk to work when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No existing medical conditions, no medications, no allergies. That’s helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I have been fortunate, thankfully. I broke my wrist when I was a young boy, playing football, but it healed very well. No operations were needed. Just a cast, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, my parents are… gone now. I have a sister, but we do not speak often. She lives in Budapest. As for medical problems in my family… my mother had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I do not recall the details precisely. Nothing major, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, when you say trouble with her stomach, do you remember what kind of trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… It was… indigestion, perhaps? And sometimes, she complained of bloating, similar to what I am experiencing now. But it was many years ago, Doctor. My memory is… not so perfect with details from my childhood. She did not see a doctor often. She just… suffered in silence, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, some indigestion and bloating in your mother. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your diet. You mentioned you eat normally. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, for breakfast, I usually have toast with a little bit of jam. Sometimes, I have an egg. For lunch, I work at the fast food restaurant, so… I usually eat a sandwich there. A turkey sandwich, usually. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes, I have soup. Sometimes, pasta. I drink water with my meals. And occasionally, I have a small dessert. Nothing too unhealthy, I think. I avoid very spicy foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast with jam, a turkey sandwich, soup or pasta, with water. Avoiding spicy foods. Do you consume dairy products?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I like yogurt, sometimes. And cheese, with my sandwich. Not a large amount, but… yes, I eat dairy. I have never noticed any problems with it. I do not drink a lot of milk, though. Perhaps a glass of milk with my breakfast occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I have no objections at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Let me know if anything feels tender. …Alright, that doesn’t reveal anything immediately concerning. Your bowel sounds are present, though perhaps a little… active. And there’s some mild tenderness when I press here, on your lower left side. Not anything alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to ask some additional questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in bowel habits? Hmm… sometimes, I feel the need to go more frequently than usual. Not… diarrhea, exactly. Just… a more urgent feeling. And sometimes, it is difficult to… complete the process, if you understand. A little straining, occasionally. But it is not constant. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent urges and sometimes difficulty completing the process with some straining. That’s helpful information. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any blood. Not that I have noticed, at least. Everything seems… normal in that regard. It is just the gas, the bloating, and the… urgency, you understand. And the occasional straining. It is very embarrassing to discuss, honestly. But I appreciate you asking.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, possibly triggered by something you ate. The black beans could have been the initial trigger, and it's continuing even without them because your gut microbiome may be a little disrupted. We’ll want to rule out anything more serious, but that’s a likely possibility. I’d like to order a stool sample to check for infection or inflammation. Also, I recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet for a few weeks, which can help identify trigger foods. Have you heard of that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never heard of a “low-FODMAP” diet. What does that involve, precisely? And what is a “microbiome”? You are using very technical language, and I am… not a medical professional, you see. Is it something difficult? I do not want to spend my life avoiding all food. Will it help with the gas?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask – I apologize for the medical jargon. Let me explain. A “microbiome” is just the collection of all the bacteria that live in your gut – it's important for digestion and overall health. Sometimes, that balance gets disrupted. A low-FODMAP diet is about temporarily reducing certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult for some people to digest, and thus cause gas and bloating. It's not about avoiding all food, but cutting out high-FODMAP foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. Then, we slowly reintroduce them one at a time to identify your triggers. It can be helpful, and we have resources to help you navigate it. I'll have my nurse give you a handout with a list of high- and low-FODMAP foods. We’ll also schedule you for the stool sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds much better. Explaining it like that is very helpful. Reducing certain foods temporarily sounds… manageable. And if it helps with the gas, then I am willing to try. A handout would be wonderful. And the stool sample… well, it is not pleasant, but I understand it is necessary. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now. What should I do if my symptoms get worse while on this diet?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s important to me that you understand everything. If your symptoms get worse while on the diet – meaning increased pain, blood in your stool, or a high fever – please contact the office immediately. We want to rule out any other potential causes. Otherwise, if it’s just a slight increase in gas or bloating that doesn’t resolve after a few days, that’s likely just part of the adjustment period. My nurse will schedule the stool sample and provide the dietary handout. We’ll follow up in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You have been very patient and helpful. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it very much. I will see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
