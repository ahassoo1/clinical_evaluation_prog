DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My ear… it is leaking something. It started maybe three days ago. Not much at first, but now… more. It is uncomfortable, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Leaking from your ear for about three days, and it’s become more uncomfortable. Can you describe what the leaking looks like?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, sometimes. Not blood, no. And it smells… not good. A little bit. It is hard to explain. Like… old water? Is that a good way to say?
DOCTOR: Okay, clear with a bit of yellow, and a slightly foul odor… like old water, you said. Alright. And is there any pain associated with it, besides the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, some pain. Not all the time. When I press here… … it hurts. And when I lie down on that side… also. Not so bad when I am sitting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with pressure and when lying on that side. Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. My hearing… maybe a little bit quieter in that ear, yes. But not much. I can still hear, I think. It is hard to tell. I am old. Sometimes my ears just stop working anyway.
DOCTOR: Well, we want to make sure everything is working as best as it can. Have you had any ear infections before, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy. In Somalia. Many times. The doctor… he put drops in my ear. It always got better. I do not remember the name of the drops. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of ear infections as a child, treated with ear drops. Do you have any other medical problems that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: No, no. I am healthy, mostly. My blood pressure… the doctor checks it sometimes. He says it is okay. I take a pill for my water. The doctor said my kidneys. It is small. A white pill. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for your kidneys – a diuretic, likely. We can look that up later to confirm. And are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no supplements. Only the white pill for my kidneys. And sometimes… a little pain pill. When my back hurts. But not every day. I do not take it now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. My wife… she is allergic to peanuts. But not me. I can eat anything. I like food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we take a look at your ear, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… many people. My father, he had problems with his legs. He walked with a stick. My mother… she was healthy, I think. She died a long time ago. I have brothers and sisters, but they live in Somalia. I do not see them often. They are probably okay. I do not know their medical problems. It is hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. History of leg problems in your father. We don’t have much information about the rest of your family’s health, and that’s alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. I do not like it. And I do not drink alcohol. It is not good for you. And no… other things. No. I am a good man, Doctor. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Radillo. Alright, let’s take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope – it’s a little instrument with a light on the end, I’ll just gently put it in your ear canal to get a better look. It won’t hurt, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Gently, yes? My ear is… sensitive. I will tell you if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some inflammation in your ear canal and some fluid behind your eardrum. The eardrum itself looks a bit cloudy. There is discharge present, as you mentioned. It looks like you have an outer ear infection, likely otitis externa. It's quite common. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Otitis… what? Outer ear… yes, that is my ear. Infection… I understand. Is it bad, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? It is important to hear.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad in the sense that it’s not life-threatening. And you’re not going to lose your hearing. It's very treatable. The inflammation and infection are what are causing your discomfort and the leakage, and potentially the slight hearing loss you’ve noticed. We’ll get you some ear drops with antibiotics and some pain medication. I'm going to write you a prescription for ciprofloxacin ear drops - you’ll put those in your ear twice a day for seven days. And I'll prescribe some ibuprofen for the pain. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Cipro… drops. Seven days. Ibuprofen… for the pain. Yes. How do I put the drops in? It is hard for me sometimes to see. And… will it hurt when I put them in? Cold?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk about the drops. It’s important to warm them up first - hold the bottle in your hand for a few minutes to make sure it's room temperature. Then, tilt your head to the side – so the ear you're treating is facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back – this helps straighten the ear canal. Put the prescribed number of drops into your ear canal. And after you put the drops in, keep your head tilted for about five minutes, then gently wipe away any excess fluid. It shouldn't hurt, but it might feel a little cool or strange at first. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Warm the bottle… pull my ear… tilt my head. Five minutes. Not too hard, yes? And… what if it does hurt? A lot?
DOCTOR: If it hurts a lot, stop. Don’t put any more drops in. And call the clinic right away. We can adjust the medication or make sure there isn’t something else going on. I'm also going to give you a written instruction sheet that explains all of this in more detail. Now, I want you to follow up with me in one week to make sure the infection is clearing up. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, one week. Okay. Written… good. I like written. And… if it does not get better? In one week?
DOCTOR: If it doesn’t get better in one week, or if your symptoms worsen at any time – if you develop a fever, severe pain, or notice any dizziness – call the clinic immediately. We may need to consider a different treatment. Here’s that written instruction sheet. And I’ve sent the prescription to your pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for your help. I will follow your instructions. One week. And no more pain. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Get some rest, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
