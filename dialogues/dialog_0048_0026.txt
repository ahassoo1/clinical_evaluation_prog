DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this tiredness. Just… so tired. Been feeling weak for a while now, and honestly, it’s getting quite bothersome. It's not like I've been doing anything to tire myself out, you know? Mostly just puttering around the house. And my husband keeps saying I look… faded. Not a good look, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness… and weakness. "Faded," you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it all blurs together, doesn’t it? Hmm… well, let me think. It’s been… longer than a few weeks, certainly. Maybe… two, three months? It started gradually, just feeling a bit more worn out than usual. But it’s gotten worse lately, definitely. I used to be able to keep up with the garden, but now… now I need help with even the simplest things.
DOCTOR: Two to three months… gradual onset. And you mentioned difficulty with activities you used to do. Any other symptoms accompanying the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… aches, I suppose. Not terrible, mind you, but a general… dullness. In my muscles, mostly. And sometimes I feel a little… shaky? It's hard to explain. Not a proper tremble, just… unstable, like I might fall. It doesn’t happen often, though. Honestly, I thought it was just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: "Unstable," you say. And muscle aches. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I still eat, though perhaps not as much as I used to. Everything just tastes… blander. Not that I was ever much of a gourmet, mind you. My husband does most of the cooking. He makes a lovely dal, but even that doesn’t have the same… zing it once did.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite and altered taste. Any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Nothing like that. I haven’t been sick to my stomach at all. Just… tired. And weak. It’s frustrating, really. I used to be so… capable. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. But now… It's just not the same.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving… interesting. And you haven’t experienced any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes, I suppose. A little woozy when I stand up too fast. But nothing major. Shortness of breath… no, not really. I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s probably just my age. Chest pain, definitely not. My heart feels fine, as far as I know. It’s just… this tiredness is so debilitating.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a quick look at your chart. Height… 150 centimeters. Weight… 108 pounds. Alright. I'm going to do a brief physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Careful now, I'm not as steady as I used to be. Just a little wobbly, you know. It's this tiredness… makes everything harder. Don't mind my complaining, I'm sure you see this all the time.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 72. A little slow, perhaps. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished. Not overly concerning at your age, but we'll keep an eye on it.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… That doesn't sound very good, does it? I always prided myself on being quick and nimble. I suppose everything slows down eventually. Is it… serious? Honestly, doctor, I just want to know if I’m going to end up bedridden. That would be dreadful.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Oitker, at your age, some slowing down is to be expected. However, your symptoms – the tiredness, weakness, diminished reflexes – warrant further investigation. We need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. And to be thorough, I'd like to order a chest X-ray, just to make sure everything looks clear. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not as far as I recall. My husband says I have a cast-iron stomach. But he also says a lot of things. I do get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but that could just be the spices. It’s not a proper allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never been much for pills. I always preferred a strong cup of tea when I wasn't feeling well. My husband tries to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse. I don't like being fussed over. It reminds me of being a child.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will draw your blood and schedule the chest X-ray. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. We'll figure this out. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Rest… easy for me to say. I’m always tired. And that X-ray… is it going to be uncomfortable? I'm not fond of being poked and prodded. Honestly, doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. That's all. No, I don't suppose there's anything else. Just… get me feeling better, alright?
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best, Mrs. Oitker. The X-ray is quite quick and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. The nurse will explain everything. We'll be in touch with the results as soon as they're available. Have a good day.
