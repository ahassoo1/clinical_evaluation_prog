DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, I’m just here to get some forms filled out. Medicare sent me a bunch, and I figured it’s easier to have someone walk me through ‘em than try and wrestle with ‘em on my own, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Medicare forms can be… extensive. That's perfectly reasonable. We’re happy to help. Please, have a seat. I’ll pull up your chart and we can go through them together. Before we dive into the forms, though, is there anything else at all that I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the forms, thank you. Everything's been pretty good, all things considered. My husband, Ben, he handles most of the… well, the worrying around here.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. A good support system is invaluable. Alright, let's start with these forms. I see here a health history questionnaire. Have you been seen by a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Not recently recently. It’s been a couple of years, I reckon. Just for my yearly check-up with Dr. Hayes back in Shelby. That was… 2023, maybe? Everything was fine then, just the usual stuff. Blood pressure a little high, but nothing to get too worked up about, he said.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2023 with Dr. Hayes for a routine check-up. Blood pressure slightly elevated noted. And did Dr. Hayes make any changes to your medications at that time?
PATIENT: No, he didn’t. I just take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure – lisinopril, I think it is? And a baby aspirin every day, just to be safe. He’s had me on those for years now. Everything else, I don’t really take nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril and a daily baby aspirin. Good. Now, on this form it asks about any allergies you may have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever real bad when I was a kid, but that’s mostly gone away. I can eat pretty much anything without trouble. Ben’s got some allergies – cats, mostly – but I'm fine around ‘em. Never had a bad reaction to a medicine, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. No known allergies. Now, this next section asks about your medical history – any significant illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past. Could you tell me about those, if any?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had my tonsils out when I was little, that's about it for surgeries. And I had the usual childhood things - measles, chickenpox, all that. Nothing major, though. Later in life... I had pneumonia once, maybe ten years ago, but I recovered alright. No serious illnesses, like heart trouble or diabetes or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood, routine childhood illnesses, and pneumonia about ten years ago. And just to be thorough, is there any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My momma had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but she lived to be eighty-five, so I guess it wasn’t too bad. My daddy was healthy as a horse right up until the end. Ben’s side… his grandma had diabetes, I think. And his uncle had cancer, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, we don’t talk about it much, family history.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It’s common for families not to have a detailed history readily available. Now, this form also asks about your current lifestyle - things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise. Do you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never have. My momma always said it was a terrible habit, and I reckon she was right. Ben used to smoke a little, years ago, but he quit a long time ago. He’s all about being healthy now.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: We don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, like holidays or birthdays. Ben likes a beer now and then, but he’s pretty moderate. We’re not big drinkers, no. We prefer coffee and a good book, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant. And finally, this form asks about your level of physical activity. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t call it exercise exactly. I help Ben out around the ranch – feedin’ the chickens, tendin’ the garden, things like that. It keeps me movin’, for sure. And we go for walks sometimes, when the weather’s nice. It’s not a gym routine or anything, but I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: That sounds very good. Staying active is wonderful. It appears we have most of this health history form completed. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, if you don’t mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Could you please sit up straight?
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if it's gonna be chilly or somethin', I get cold easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but within an acceptable range. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Deep breaths... okay. Everything feels alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen now. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort.
PATIENT: Ooh, just there, that’s a little tender. But nothin’ bad, just...sensitive sometimes. I get heartburn sometimes, maybe that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the upper abdomen. That could be related to heartburn. I’m going to listen to your stomach sounds now. Sounds are normal. Now, let’s take a quick look at your throat and ears. Please open your mouth and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: Ahhhh... everything feels normal up here, though. I haven’t been sick in ages.
DOCTOR: Okay, throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears look good as well. Everything appears normal. Alright, Ms. Fabing, the physical exam is complete. Everything appears to be within normal limits, with slightly elevated blood pressure and some tenderness in the upper abdomen, likely related to your heartburn. Overall, you appear to be in good health. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You answered everything pretty thoroughly. I was just worried about fillin’ out the forms, but you made it pretty easy. So, are we good to go now? Do I need to do anything else?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're good to go. I’ve completed the necessary forms for Medicare based on the information we've discussed today. I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, and if it consistently remains elevated, we can discuss lifestyle modifications or medication adjustments. Also, if your heartburn worsens, we can explore over-the-counter remedies or prescribe something stronger. I will send the completed forms to Medicare electronically. You should receive a confirmation notice in the mail. I'm also going to print out a summary of today’s visit for your records. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help, Dr. Quicksey. You’ve been wonderful. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And remember to take care of yourself. Here’s your summary. Have a wonderful day, and please drive safely. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too!
