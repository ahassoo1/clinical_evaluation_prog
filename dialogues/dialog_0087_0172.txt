DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, I just moved here, you see. Social thing, I suppose. New area, needs checking. Honestly, I don't recall all the details. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. A “needs checking” visit can be fairly broad, though. Could you tell me a little more about what specifically you'd like me to check?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the foggiest. I suppose… general things. You know, make sure everything is working. I’m not one to bother with specifics. It’s all rather… undignified, isn’t it? I always kept quite healthy, you understand. And I have excellent insurance, thank goodness. Medicare. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does provide excellent coverage, and we will certainly do our best to accommodate your needs. A general check-up is perfectly reasonable. To start, could you tell me about any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. Let me see… well, I get tired, naturally. At my age! And my knees… they make noises. Dreadful creaking. Is that a symptom? I wouldn't call it a problem, just… age. I mostly just want to be sure nothing… catastrophic is looming. Do you understand what I mean? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Fatigue and joint noises are common, particularly with age. We’ll explore those further. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… tiredness. A general lack of pep. It used to be I could be up and about all day, but now… a little nap in the afternoon is usually required. And it’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous! Mostly just… supervising. My husband, you see. He needs… guidance. Is this really necessary? I feel rather silly talking about this.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Engelhaupt. It’s important to understand what’s causing your fatigue, even if it seems minor. A change in your usual energy levels is worth investigating. Is the fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Usually afternoons, after luncheon. And sometimes evenings if my husband watches… those dreadful Westerns. Loud noises, you see. Drains one's energy. It's not a constant thing, thankfully. Honestly, I'm rather busy, you know. Social engagements. And I simply must be on top of things. Is this going to take much longer? I do have a bridge game later.
DOCTOR: We are making progress. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, my hands… they tremble a little. Always have, actually, but perhaps it's worse lately? I don't really look at my hands, you see. Too busy. And I seem to have lost a bit of weight, though that's probably a good thing. I was rather indulging during the holidays. Is that something to worry about? Honestly, I’m not a fan of medical fuss.
DOCTOR: Tremors and unintentional weight loss are both things we should address. About the weight loss, do you know approximately how much weight you've lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers. I hate numbers. Perhaps… five, ten pounds? Over the last few months, I suppose. It’s difficult to say precisely. I mostly just notice my clothes are a bit looser. And my husband keeps commenting on it, which is rather irritating. He means well, I suppose, but really. Is this all terribly serious? I feel perfectly fine, most of the time. It’s just… everything seems a bit much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll investigate that further. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about the past. That was a very long time ago. Let me see… I had something with my gallbladder, I think. Decades ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse. A very silly accident. Other than that… nothing significant, really. I’ve always been quite robust. I don’t see the point in dwelling on things that happened ages ago, honestly. It’s all rather… morbid, isn’t it? Are we nearly finished? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Yes, I had my tonsils out when I was a child. Dreadful experience. And… I believe I had a hysterectomy in my… well, a very long time ago. That’s all I can recall, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this all terribly important? I feel like I’m being interrogated! I simply came for a “needs checking” visit, you know. It’s all getting rather… overwhelming. .
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Engelhaupt. We’re just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. Now, are there any medications you are currently taking?
