DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. Over the last few months, I’ve noticed I’ve been getting weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re starting to droop. It’s not terribly noticeable all the time, but it's definitely getting worse.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, you say. Hmm. And how long exactly have you been noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe around February, I’d say? It was very gradual at first, just feeling a little more tired than usual after work. But it’s become more… prominent recently. It’s starting to affect things, like carrying groceries, or even just… holding my arms up for a bit. It's not a sudden thing, just a slow decline.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this drooping… is it worse in the morning, or does it stay consistent throughout the day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… it’s definitely worse in the mornings. When I first wake up, it feels like I can barely open my eyes fully. It improves a little as the day goes on, but it never really goes away completely. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I keep thinking something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, "unsettling" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Schaust. Let’s try to be a little more precise here. Have you noticed any double vision?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems… single, for lack of a better way to put it. I haven’t needed glasses in years, so I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing, unless it's obvious. So, no, no double vision. But sometimes my vision feels a bit blurry, but I thought that was just… fatigue, maybe?
DOCTOR: "Fatigue." Everyone thinks it's fatigue. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… hmm. That’s… I hadn’t really thought about it, but now that you mention it… sometimes food does feel like it catches a little in my throat. Not every time, and it’s not painful, exactly. It’s just… an effort, sometimes. Especially dry foods. It’s hard to explain. It's not severe, but it’s definitely… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right. So, weakness, drooping eyelids, fluctuating vision, and difficulty swallowing. Have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Recent infections… let me see. No, not really. I had a bad cold back in January, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then. Just the usual seasonal allergies, a bit of a runny nose in the spring, but nothing that required a doctor's visit, or anything like that. I’m generally quite healthy, to be honest. This is… new, and worrying.
DOCTOR: "Generally healthy." Alright. And do you have any family history of… neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My mother… she had some issues with muscle pain when she was older, but I don’t think it was anything… serious. She just attributed it to getting old, you know? And my father… he had high blood pressure, but no neurological problems that I’m aware of. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical histories, unfortunately. We weren’t very close. It’s not something we talked about much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it makes my job more difficult when you don't have a thorough family history. Now, let’s talk about you. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications. I try to avoid them if I can. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, exercise… well, I used to exercise more regularly, but with the weakness, it’s become a bit difficult. I've also been a bit stressed at work, recently. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Stress doesn't have a blood test, Mr. Schaust. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. I just want to find out what’s going on. I'm starting to get quite worried about this.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Your reflexes are a little diminished. And your pupils are… slightly constricted. Now, open your mouth and say "Ah." Throat looks clear. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Look left, look right, look up, look down. Hmm. There's a slight weakness in your eye muscles. Now, I want you to push against my hands. I’ll ask you to push, and then I’ll resist. Strength is… reduced. Not significantly, but noticeable. Okay. Based on this initial examination, and your symptoms, I'm concerned about possible Myasthenia Gravis. It's an autoimmune condition that causes muscle weakness. But we need to confirm it with some blood tests. I'll order a complete blood count, an acetylcholine receptor antibody test, and a thyroid panel. We'll also do an Electromyography, or EMG, to measure your muscle activity. That will give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? That sounds… serious. Autoimmune? Is that… treatable? And what does the EMG involve? Will it be painful? I… I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I hadn’t expected anything like this. Could you… explain a bit more about what this all means?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Calm down. It can be serious, but it's not necessarily a death sentence. It's a chronic autoimmune disorder where your immune system mistakenly attacks the connections between your nerves and muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. As for treatment, yes, it is manageable. We have medications that can suppress your immune system and improve your muscle strength. We can also do a thymectomy, which is a surgical removal of the thymus gland, which often helps. Now, the EMG… it involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a mild muscle cramp, but it shouldn't be excruciating. It's a standard diagnostic procedure. We’ll need to see a neurologist for that, I’ll provide you a referral. Look, I understand you're overwhelmed. But we need to get a definitive diagnosis before we can formulate a proper treatment plan. The blood tests and EMG will help us do that. I'll order them immediately. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity, and try to get as much rest as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… all for now. So, the neurologist will contact me to schedule the EMG? And the blood tests… will I need to fast? Is there anything else I should be aware of? I’m just… trying to process everything. This is a lot to take in, especially… after just a few months of feeling a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, the neurologist’s office will contact you to schedule the EMG. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. I’ve included that information on the requisition. Look, I understand this is unsettling, and I apologize if I seem… abrupt. I have a lot of patients, and I need to keep things moving. But you need to understand, early diagnosis is crucial with these autoimmune conditions. The sooner we get started with treatment, the better the outcome. I'm also going to write you a temporary prescription for pyridostigmine, a medication that can help temporarily improve muscle strength while we wait for the test results. It won’t cure anything, but it might make things a little more manageable. Here are the prescriptions and the lab requisition. And here’s the referral to the neurologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I'll review the results with you once they're available. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: Pyridostigmine… Are there… side effects? And what if it doesn’t work? I mean, you said it’s temporary, but… I just… I don’t want to be reliant on medication if there’s another way. This all feels very… daunting. And expensive. I… I don’t have insurance, Doctor. Will this be… a significant financial burden?
DOCTOR: Yes, pyridostigmine has potential side effects, like nausea, diarrhea, and muscle cramps. We'll monitor you closely to minimize those. And yes, it's not a cure, it’s just a symptomatic treatment. As for a "significant financial burden", Mr. Schaust, I’m a doctor, not a financial advisor. Look, I understand you don’t have insurance, but you need to prioritize your health. We can discuss payment options at the billing office. As for the tests and medication, there may be patient assistance programs available. I’ll have the staff provide you with some information. Frankly, worrying about the cost won’t solve anything. We need to get a diagnosis and start treatment. I’ve written a note regarding your lack of insurance. Now, do you have any further questions about the medication itself?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. I… I appreciate your time. And the information. I’ll… I’ll schedule the appointment with the neurologist. And I’ll speak to the billing office. It’s just… a lot to process. Thank you.
