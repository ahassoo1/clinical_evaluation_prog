DOCTOR: Hi Nicoletta, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, you see, I’m… getting on in years, as they say. And I feel like I need a little… a little boost. A reset, maybe? I just want to feel a bit more like myself again, if you understand. I want to get back to doing things.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Nicoletta. It’s very common to want a “reset” as we get older, and wanting to feel more like yourself is a great goal. It’s good you’re taking the initiative to address this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what “not feeling like yourself” means?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not one big thing, you see. It’s just… everything feels a little slower. Getting up in the morning is harder. I used to love gardening, but I don’t have the energy for it like I used to. And sometimes, my memory… it plays tricks on me. Little things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses – even though they're usually on my head! It's just… a general feeling of being… worn down, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Nicoletta. “Worn down” is a good way to put it. Slower mornings, less energy for things you enjoy, and some memory concerns – those all sound like things we can definitely explore. Let's start with the memory concerns. You mentioned “little things.” Can you give me a specific example of something you've forgotten recently, or a situation where you felt your memory wasn’t working as well as it should?
PATIENT: Well, just last week… my grandson, little Kai, he came to visit. A lovely boy. And I… I couldn’t quite remember his birthday. It was just on the tip of my tongue! He reminded me, of course. August 15th. But it bothered me, you see? I always remembered my grandchildren’s birthdays. And then… oh dear. What else was I going to say? There was something else... Oh! Yes. I made a pot of coffee, and then completely forgot why! I just stood there, looking at it, wondering what I was supposed to do with it. Silly things, really.
DOCTOR: Those aren’t silly things at all, Nicoletta. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and bringing them to my attention. Forgetting a birthday, or why you made coffee… those can be normal as we age, but it’s important to understand what’s going on. To get a better picture, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Not all the time, mind you. But when I’m talking to people, the word I want just… escapes me. It’s frustrating. And I find myself repeating questions, even when I know I just asked them. I don’t mean to be rude, it just… happens. I worry about it, you see. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Nicoletta, and it’s good you're being so aware of these changes. Difficulty finding words and repeating questions are things we should definitely look into further. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why gardening is harder now. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but my doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely man – he has me on medication for that. It seems to be keeping it under control. I also had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but I had a stent put in, and I've been doing pretty well since then. Mostly, just the arthritis bothers me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Arthritis, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of a stent placement – thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries other than the stent placement?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh! Yes. When I was younger, I had my gallbladder removed. And I broke my wrist once, years ago, when I was still teaching. That required surgery to set the bone. But that was a long time ago. Everything healed up fine. Nothing major lately, just the stent, really. And the gallbladder was… well, it was quite some time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my husband, God rest his soul, he passed away ten years ago. We had three children. Two boys and a girl. All grown up now, with families of their own. They all live on the mainland, which is why it’s so nice when they visit. They’re very good to me, they are. My oldest son, he's a doctor himself, actually. Funny, isn't it? As for medical history… my mother had diabetes, and my father… he had heart problems, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details very well.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That's helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, that I can recall. I do get a bit itchy sometimes when I’m around certain flowers, but that's just a mild allergy, not serious. Nothing that requires any special attention, I don't believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, for my arthritis, Dr. Ramirez prescribed something... let me see... naproxen, I believe it's called. I take that every day, to help with the pain. And sometimes, when the pain is really bad, I take Tylenol as well. Just when I need it, though. And... Oh! And I take a calcium supplement, because Dr. Ramirez said my bones are a little weak. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and a calcium supplement. Thank you. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological assessment to check your memory and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Please, go right ahead. I just hope I don't disappoint with my memory!
DOCTOR: You won't disappoint me at all, Nicoletta. This is just to get a baseline, and help me understand what’s going on. First, let’s check your blood pressure. And it looks like your blood pressure is 138 over 78. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so, given you're on medication. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Alright, and now we'll do a quick memory test. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Today is... Oh dear. Is it still August? I believe it’s August 2nd... yes, that sounds right. August 2nd, 2025. But please, don’t think too badly of me if I’m wrong!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nicoletta. It's good you were able to get the month and year. Sometimes it takes a moment to recall the exact date. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please try to remember them, as I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I think I have them. Apple, table, penny. Let me see… apple, table, penny. I hope I don’t forget! It’s silly, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Nicoletta. It’s a normal part of the assessment. Now, let's do a quick assessment of your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit slower than average, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern, especially given your age. Finally, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock showing 10 minutes after 11. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A clock? I used to be quite good at drawing… Alright, let me see… Here we are. It's not very pretty, but it should show ten minutes after eleven, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That’s very helpful. The drawing is a bit simplified, and the numbers are a little uneven, but that's not unusual. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, you're experiencing some cognitive changes – specifically with memory and drawing – along with some overall fatigue and arthritis. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something to keep an eye on. Given your age and these symptoms, we need to investigate further to determine the cause. It could be due to normal age-related changes, medication side effects, or something else entirely. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying infections. I also recommend a brain scan—a CT scan or MRI—to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and a brain scan… that sounds rather… serious. Well, if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you recommend. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. I trust your judgment. Are those tests… are those tests painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nicoletta. It does sound like a lot, but it’s important to get a clear understanding of what’s going on so we can develop the best plan for you. The blood tests are very straightforward. A nurse will simply draw a small amount of blood from your arm. There may be a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick and not very painful. The brain scan—we can start with a CT scan, as it’s less invasive—involves lying still on a table while a machine takes images of your brain. It’s completely painless, but you need to lie very still for a few minutes. I’ll also need you to tell me about any medications you're currently taking. Can you list them for me, including the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have my blood pressure medication… let me see… it’s losartan, 50 milligrams, once a day. And for my arthritis, I take naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day. Sometimes I take Tylenol, 500 milligrams, as needed, but not regularly. And I take a calcium supplement… about 600 milligrams, once a day. Is that everything? Oh! And sometimes, Dr. Ramirez recommends a vitamin D supplement… but I forget how much.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Nicoletta. We'll look into the vitamin D dosage as well. Based on the medications you're taking, there's a small chance that the naproxen could be contributing to some of your cognitive changes, as it can sometimes cause confusion, especially in older adults. But we need the blood tests and brain scan to get a more definitive answer. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed, but I would suggest stopping the naproxen temporarily, unless you're experiencing severe arthritis pain. If you need pain relief, you can try Tylenol, but try to use the lowest effective dose. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Stopping the naproxen… I can try that. It does sometimes make me feel a little… foggy, now that you mention it. Alright, I'll stop taking it unless the pain gets really bad. And I’ll try to remember to take only as much Tylenol as I need. So… what happens next? When will I get the blood tests? And when will I have the scan? I hope it doesn’t take too long… I just want to know what’s going on, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicoletta. You’re right to want answers as soon as possible. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples right away. They’ll send them to the lab, and the results should be back in about 2-3 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll schedule the CT scan. We can usually get you in within a week, depending on availability. I'll call you as soon as I have the results and the scan is scheduled. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please call my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I think that covers everything. No, I don't think so. You've been very patient with me, Doctor. And very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… it’s a relief to know someone is looking into it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nicoletta. It's my pleasure. I'm here to help, and we’ll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself.
