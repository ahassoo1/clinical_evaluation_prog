DOCTOR: Right. Esthela Pandolfi, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Memmolo, it’s… a delicate situation, really. I’m dating someone new, and I want to be… thorough. You understand. It's just, one needs to be certain these days, wouldn't you agree? I want to ensure everything is… as it should be, before things progress any further.
DOCTOR: "Thorough," right. Of course. It’s… prudent to be careful. Are you experiencing any symptoms that are concerning you, or is this purely preventative?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, no, nothing like that, Doctor. I feel perfectly fine. It’s not about me feeling unwell, it’s about… him. And what he might be carrying, if you catch my drift. I simply want to be… informed. I’ve always been a very practical woman. And frankly, I expect a certain level of… discretion from a partner. It's a matter of responsibility, really.
DOCTOR: So, you're requesting STI testing for your partner?
PATIENT: STI testing? Is that what the young people are calling it these days? Yes, that’s… a good way to put it. Though, I prefer to think of it as a… a compatibility assessment. A responsible one. It's not simply about diseases, Doctor, it's about understanding… the whole picture. And, frankly, ensuring he’s… suitable. I’ve been married before, you see, and one learns from experience. It's best to know before any… significant commitment is made.
DOCTOR: Right. Compatibility. Of course. Well, we can certainly arrange that. Do you have a list of any specific concerns, or should we run a standard panel?
PATIENT: A standard panel will be… adequate, I suppose. Though, I did read an article – quite a distressing article, really – about something called mycoplasma genitalium. It seems terribly… persistent. Yes, I believe it's crucial we test for that. And anything else that a gentleman of… his lifestyle might be prone to acquiring. I wouldn’t want to be remiss in overlooking anything. It's best to be overly cautious, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: Mycoplasma genitalium, yes. Very… trendy these days. Fine. We'll include that. Have you ever been tested for anything, or had any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve always been… very careful. And my previous husband… well, he was a man of… standing. No, I have never needed to undergo such testing. I assure you, my record is… impeccable. It's quite a contrast, I'm afraid, to the… type of gentleman I’m currently seeing. Which is precisely why I’m here, of course. One must protect oneself, wouldn't you agree? It’s simply common sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Common sense. Very well. Let's get a urine sample first, and then we can discuss the practicalities of getting him tested. Do you have his consent for this, naturally?
PATIENT: Consent? Well, he hasn’t explicitly given it, but he knows I’m a practical woman. I explained it’s simply a matter of due diligence, ensuring a… healthy foundation for our future. He’s a modern man, I believe he understands. Honestly, if he objects to being thoroughly vetted, that says a great deal about his character, doesn’t it? I’m not about to compromise my standards. I’ll simply… insist. He’ll understand. It’s for his own good, really. A clean bill of health is… reassuring for everyone involved.
DOCTOR: "Insist," you say. While I appreciate your… proactive approach, ethically, we really need documented consent before testing anyone. It's a legal requirement, and frankly, a matter of basic respect. Perhaps you should have a more… frank conversation with him before proceeding. I can’t, and won’t, test someone without their explicit permission.
PATIENT: Explicit permission? Honestly, Doctor, the bureaucracy! It's simply… exhausting. He’s a grown man, capable of making his own decisions. I assure you, he isn’t the sort who requires hand-holding. He'll agree, eventually. I’m a rather… persuasive woman. Perhaps I should simply bring him in, and you can explain the importance of due diligence. You're a doctor, you have authority. Surely he'll listen to you. I'm certain a brief explanation from a medical professional will suffice. It's a matter of common sense, really. A healthy relationship requires transparency, doesn't it? And frankly, I don't have time for… unnecessary complications.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your concerns, but this isn't a matter of "complications." It’s a legal and ethical boundary. I can’t force someone to be tested, and I won't participate in anything that doesn't respect their autonomy. Perhaps you should reconsider this relationship if he’s unwilling to be transparent with you about his health. I’m not going to be the one to “persuade” him. Now, are you willing to provide a sample?
