DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. And I think it’s finally time I tried to stop. It’s not been easy, you understand. Not easy at all.
DOCTOR: A long time, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sixty years. Started when I was fourteen, back in Lithuania, actually. A foolish habit picked up from my older cousins. And it just… stuck. A very stubborn habit.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is… considerable. And you’re coming to us now to quit?
PATIENT: Well, yes. It’s… complicated. I’ve tried before, you see. Many times. Patches, gum… even those things you inhale. Nothing has really… taken. But I’m getting older, and it’s becoming harder to breathe. And I don’t want to be a burden on anyone, should something… happen. It feels like a good time to finally give it a proper effort.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sixty years of smoking, multiple failed attempts with patches, gum, inhalers… And now shortness of breath is prompting you to try again. Can you tell me roughly how much you smoke now?
PATIENT: About a pack and a half a day, Doctor. Maybe a little more if I’m stressed. I mostly smoke Marlboro Reds. It’s… it’s a routine, you see. After breakfast, with coffee. After lunch. Before bed. It’s woven into the fabric of my day, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: A pack and a half… That’s… significant. And you've noticed the shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s not… debilitating, not yet. But I find myself getting winded walking up the stairs. Or even just carrying groceries. Things I used to do without a second thought. It started maybe six months ago, gradually getting worse. It worries me, naturally. I don’t want to end up… housebound.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I do cough quite a bit in the mornings. A deep, rattling cough. And sometimes, I get a tightness in my chest. Not pain, exactly, but… uncomfortable. It usually goes away after a bit, but it’s there. I haven't bothered the doctor about it before, to be honest. I always figured it was just… the smoking. A foolish thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Foolish" or not, it's good you're mentioning it now. Do you cough up anything when you cough?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly… phlegm. Clear, usually. But sometimes, in the mornings, it’s… a bit discolored. A sort of… yellowish tinge. It hasn't been bloody, if that’s what you’re asking. But it’s not a pleasant sight, I assure you. I’ve always had a bit of a smoker’s cough, of course, but this feels… different. More persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. We’re going to need to do a quick physical exam. And I’ll likely want to order a chest X-ray, just to get a baseline and see what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but that's all. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And I'm not allergic to anything, not even bee stings or poison ivy. A remarkably allergy-free man, I am. Though, I suppose the smoking has done enough damage on its own.
DOCTOR: Well, let's have a listen to your lungs then. If you wouldn’t mind getting up and sitting on the table. And we'll check your blood pressure and pulse while we’re at it.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I've always tried to be a cooperative patient. Though, I confess, I’m not particularly fond of doctors’ offices. They always smell of… disinfectant and worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your breathing sounds… diminished, particularly in the lower lobes. There’s some wheezing as well. I also hear some crackles. It’s not surprising given your smoking history, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand it’s not unexpected, given the years of… indulgence. And I appreciate your candor. I’d rather know the truth, however unpleasant, than be left in the dark. I’ve always been a practical man. Listening to my heart, you say? Proceed as you need to. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but it’s present. Alright. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And I want you to get a blood test to check your oxygen levels and look for any signs of infection. Do you have any family history of heart disease or lung problems?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My father… he died of a heart attack when he was seventy-two. A sudden thing, they said. And my mother, she suffered from bronchitis for many years, especially in the winter. She always blamed the cold, but I suspect it was… something more. They were both strong people, but… health wasn’t always on their side. It’s… concerning to hear about the murmur, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knowing your family history is helpful. We'll get those tests scheduled right away. I want to be thorough. And… Mr. Knoch, I need to be frank with you. Given your smoking history, the diminished lung sounds, and the murmur, we need to rule out some serious possibilities. It’s possible you have COPD, or even lung cancer. I don’t want to alarm you, but we need to be prepared.
PATIENT: .
