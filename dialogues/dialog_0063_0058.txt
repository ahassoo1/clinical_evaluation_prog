DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, concise is good. I’m here about… well, my weight. I’ve been putting on a bit, and I’d like to talk about maybe some medicine to help with it, if that’s possible. It’s becoming a bit difficult to get around, you see. Especially with my… with the work I do.
DOCTOR: Right. Weight gain. Understandable, at your age. Though, frankly, a little discipline goes a long way. But we shall see. How long have you been noticing this…increase, and can you quantify it, roughly?
PATIENT: Quantify… hmm. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, Doctor. More… gradual. Over the last year, maybe? Perhaps ten, fifteen pounds? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t weigh myself often, I just notice my clothes fitting a little tighter. And I get tired quicker, especially after working with the wood. It’s a physical job, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, physical labor. I read that in your chart. Ten to fifteen pounds over a year… not ideal. And the fatigue. Do you experience shortness of breath with exertion, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: No, not really shortness of breath. Just… winded, you know? Like I’m using more energy to do the same things. It's mostly in my legs, really. And my back. Building those models, even small ones, takes a lot out of me now. I used to be able to work all day without thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, weight gain, primarily affecting legs and back. And you are… a woodworker. Anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my wife… she passed away a little over a year ago. It’s been… difficult. I’ve been eating more comfort food, I suppose. Not making the best choices. I keep busy with the models, but it's not the same.
DOCTOR: Grief. Yes, that can certainly affect appetite. Though, frankly, self-control is still paramount. We'll proceed as if it’s purely physiological, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. I understand. Just… getting back to how I was, that’s what I’d like. And if medicine can help, I’m willing to try. I'm not looking for a miracle, just… a little assistance.
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we discuss pharmaceutical options, which I assure you are not without side effects, we need a baseline. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical? Hmm. Let me think… It was… a couple of years ago, I believe. With Dr. Nakamura, before he retired. I haven't really seen a doctor since then, to be honest. I keep myself busy, and… well, I haven't felt it was necessary.
DOCTOR: Of course. Well, Mr. Osumi, it is necessary now. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before attributing this to simply…lifestyle. I’ll need to order some bloodwork: a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a TSH to check your thyroid. And frankly, at your age and weight, an EKG wouldn’t be amiss. We'll also take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. I suppose that makes sense. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Bloodwork, EKG… whatever it takes to get this sorted out. As long as it doesn't take too long, if that’s alright? I have a few commissions I'm hoping to finish soon.
DOCTOR: Efficiency is key, I agree. The nurse will take your blood pressure and draw the blood samples. Then we'll perform a quick EKG. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. We will reassess then. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Nothing to worry about there. I eat everything, practically. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. The nurse will be in shortly to begin the preliminary tests. I would also like to know your current medications, if any, and a list of any past surgical procedures you’ve had. And just to be clear, have you made any dietary changes recently, beyond the… “comfort food”?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never been much for taking pills, if I can avoid it. No surgeries either, thankfully. And no, no recent dietary changes. Just… more of the usual, but perhaps… larger portions.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no surgeries, no recent dietary changes aside from portion size. The nurse will be in shortly. Please try to relax. And Mr. Osumi, I must stress the importance of lifestyle modifications in conjunction with any pharmaceutical intervention. Simply put, a pill cannot counteract a poor diet and lack of physical activity. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. I’m not expecting a miracle, like I said. And I’m willing to try and… eat better, move around more. It's just… been difficult lately, getting motivated. But I’ll do my best. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse is preparing the examination room now. Please proceed back there and she will take your vitals and draw blood. I'll review the results as soon as they come in. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any immediate concerns.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And… I will. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
