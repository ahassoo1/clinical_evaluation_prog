DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're with Medicare, and we’re located in a rather… remote area. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Eaddy. Yeah, that’s right, Medicare. And… remote is a good word for it! Honestly, I just moved here with my husband. Thought I should, like… get checked out by a doctor, you know? Just to be safe. I don’t really have anything wrong, I don't think. It’s just… new area and all.
DOCTOR: A sensible precaution, I suppose. Though, simply establishing care without a presenting complaint… isn't entirely efficient. Still. Very well. To be thorough, let’s start with a basic history. Tell me, have you been experiencing any particular symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really? I mean, I get tired sometimes, but… everyone does, right? And my back aches a little after work, but I do a lot of bending and lifting. It's just… normal stuff. I don't know if that counts as symptoms. I’m a mechanic, so… things get sore.
DOCTOR: “Normal stuff,” as you put it, can be quite revealing. Fatigue, however… is rather non-specific. And back pain in a young woman… while understandable given your profession, requires some exploration. Let’s not dismiss anything prematurely. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? I… I don’t think so? I mean, I had the chickenpox when I was little, but… that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, but it healed fine. Nothing the doctors ever said was… chronic. Does high blood pressure count? My mom has that, but I haven’t been checked or anything.
DOCTOR: Chickenpox is hardly a chronic condition, Ms. Bonck. And a childhood broken arm is, as you say, resolved. Your mother's hypertension is… relevant family history, though. We will, naturally, assess your own blood pressure today. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter remedies, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… not really? Well, sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it's really bad. Just the regular kind, you get at the store. And… my grandma used to give me tea for when I was sick, but I haven’t had any of that in ages. It was, like, chamomile, I think? Nothing the doctor gave me, though. Definitely not regular.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is… unlikely to be of medical significance, Ms. Bonck. Ibuprofen, however, is pertinent. Do you take it frequently?
PATIENT: Well… when my back flares up, yeah. Sometimes a few days in a row. It depends. If I have a really heavy job, or I bend wrong… maybe three or four days straight? I try not to take too much, but… it helps. Does that count as “too much”? I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: “Trying not to” is not a dosage, Ms. Bonck. Prolonged ibuprofen use, even over-the-counter, can have… consequences. We will need to discuss this further. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but I just thought that was pollen. Never been to a doctor about it. And… no food allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Oh! Wait… once, when I was little, I got a rash after touching poison ivy. But that’s not an allergy, right? Just… a rash?
DOCTOR: Poison ivy is a contact dermatitis, Ms. Bonck, not an allergy per se, though it does involve an immune response. Let’s focus on true allergic reactions. Have you ever experienced hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face or throat after taking a medication or consuming a particular food?
PATIENT: No! Never. Nothing like that. I mean, I've had a stomach ache after eating something bad sometimes, but that’s just… a stomach ache. Not, like, swelling or anything scary. I don’t think I'm allergic to anything. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, for a rather brief overview of your past medical history, if you please. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason other than a childhood illness?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a baby, for shots? But I don’t really remember that. And… oh! Once, I went to the emergency room when I cut my hand really bad at work. But they just stitched it up and sent me home. Not like, stayed overnight or anything. So… no. Not really hospitalized.
DOCTOR: And past surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical… history? Let me think… no, I don’t think so. I mean, they took out my wisdom teeth when I was younger, but… that was just one quick thing. Not like a real surgery, you know? Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal is a surgical procedure, Ms. Bonck. But very well. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mom has high blood pressure, like I said. And… my grandma had diabetes. And… my uncle had something with his heart, I think? But I don't really know what it was. He… he didn't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: And your father?
PATIENT: Um… my dad… he passed away a few years ago. I… I don’t really know much about what he had. He wasn’t very good at talking about his health. I think it was something with his lungs, but… I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Definitely not. Never. I don’t like any of that stuff. My husband doesn’t either. We work hard, that’s what we do. No time for… any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bonck. That concludes the history. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. We'll start with your vital signs. Please sit back, and relax. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I just… I hope everything’s okay. I don’t feel sick or anything, but… you never know, right?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Routine preventative care is always prudent. Now, please take a deep breath. Lungs clear bilaterally. Respiratory rate is sixteen breaths per minute. Heart rate is seventy-two beats per minute, regular rhythm. No murmurs auscultated. Blood pressure is 138 over 88 millimeters of mercury. Slightly elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My mom has high blood pressure, like I said… Does that mean I have it too?
DOCTOR: One reading does not constitute a diagnosis, Ms. Bonck. It simply indicates a need for further evaluation. We'll need to repeat the measurement and possibly conduct additional testing. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Testing… reflexes. That sounds… scary. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It should not be painful, Ms. Bonck. It’s a simple neurological assessment. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, equal and symmetric. No asymmetry noted. Sensory intact to light touch. Now, I’d like to briefly palpate your abdomen. Please lie back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Palpate… my abdomen? What are you looking for? I'm not pregnant, if that's what you're thinking.
DOCTOR: That was not my intention, Ms. Bonck. I am assessing for tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. No palpable masses noted. Alright, Ms. Bonck. That concludes the physical examination. Based on our assessment, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you report a family history of hypertension. We will need to repeat the blood pressure measurement on multiple occasions and may consider further testing, such as a lipid panel and a complete metabolic panel.
PATIENT: So… is something wrong? Do I need medicine? Should I be worried? I just moved here, and I don't even have a regular doctor yet… This is all a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It is premature to say definitively that something is “wrong,” Ms. Bonck. We’ve identified a potential issue that requires monitoring. It's quite common for blood pressure to fluctuate. However, given your family history, it is prudent to investigate further. I recommend we repeat the blood pressure measurement in one week. We will also schedule bloodwork to assess your cholesterol, kidney function, and electrolytes. Based on the results, we can determine if medication is necessary. For now, I recommend adopting a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I can provide you with a referral to a local cardiologist for a second opinion, if you wish. However, I believe we can manage this effectively here, with regular monitoring and appropriate lifestyle modifications. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… I guess not. But I don’t really know anything about low-sodium diets or anything like that. And I work really hard, it’s hard to find time for exercise. Maybe… maybe the cardiologist would be good? Just to be sure? And… could you write down what low-sodium means? I don't want to mess anything up. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Very well. A referral to Dr. Alistair Finch, a local cardiologist, is arranged. I will have the receptionist schedule an appointment for you. This handout details low-sodium dietary guidelines. Essentially, avoid processed foods, limit your salt intake, and focus on fresh, whole foods. I will also send a copy of your chart and lab results to Dr. Finch. He will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss your lab results and Dr. Finch’s recommendations. In the meantime, if you experience any symptoms such as severe headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Eaddy. I appreciate you explaining everything… even though it’s a lot. I’ll… I’ll go talk to the receptionist. This is all just a little scary, moving to a new place and everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the office.
