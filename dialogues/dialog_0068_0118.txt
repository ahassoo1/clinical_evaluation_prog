DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Something about needing… certification? For my work, I believe. It's rather inconvenient, all this paperwork and appointments. I do hope this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Certification… Right. I see a note here about a routine health assessment required for your continued employment as a longshoreman, is that correct?
PATIENT: Longshoreman? Oh, dear. No, no, that’s… not quite right. I haven't been a longshoreman in… well, a very long time. I work in healthcare, technical work, you understand. Something to do with equipment, I suppose. Honestly, the details escape me. Perhaps there’s been a mix-up. It wouldn't be the first time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, that is odd. The paperwork specifically states longshoreman. Let’s just… focus on getting you cleared for whatever this assessment is for, then. To do that, I need some information. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? At my age? One accumulates a few… minor inconveniences, naturally. Nothing of any real consequence. A touch of arthritis, perhaps, and my memory isn’t what it once was, as you may have noticed. But nothing that would impede my… abilities. Really, I’m quite robust for a man of my years. Do you need a detailed list? It seems rather excessive.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and some memory difficulties… alright. And have you been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… now that you mention it, there was something. A bit of… dizziness, I believe. Years ago. They gave me some pills, but they didn’t seem to do much good. It wasn’t serious, though. Probably just something related to… well, getting older, wouldn't you agree? It’s hardly worth dwelling on. A fleeting episode, really.
DOCTOR: Dizziness… okay. Any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, are you questioning my health? I assure you, I'm quite particular about my well-being. I maintain a reasonable diet, and I’ve always been a fairly active individual. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Absolutely not. And my heart… perfectly sound, thank you very much. I’d know if something was amiss. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a difficult question. I take a few things here and there… for the arthritis, I suppose. Some sort of pain reliever, I believe. And occasionally, a sleeping pill if I’m particularly restless. But honestly, I can’t recall the names. They all look the same to me. Little white pills, mostly. I get them from the pharmacy, of course. Is it truly necessary to know the precise details? It seems a rather tedious exercise.
DOCTOR: It is important, sir. Knowing what you’re taking helps avoid any potential interactions. Do you happen to have a list, perhaps from the pharmacy?
PATIENT: A list? Good heavens, no. I don’t keep track of such trivial matters. Here, this is the most recent receipt from the pharmacy, if that’s of any use. Though I doubt it will be terribly helpful. It’s just a jumble of numbers and codes, as far as I’m concerned. Honestly, the bureaucracy of it all is quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright… it appears you recently filled prescriptions for ibuprofen and… trazodone. Do you know what those are for?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… trazodone… those sound vaguely familiar. Ibuprofen, isn't that for aches and pains? And trazodone… the sleeping pill, I presume? Yes, yes, that’s right. But honestly, I don’t concern myself with the specifics. I simply take what the doctor prescribes, and hope for the best. Is it really necessary to interrogate me about every little detail? It’s quite… demeaning, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now there's a question. I suppose I'm not particularly fond of dust, if that counts. And I’ve always found shellfish a bit… disagreeable. But an actual allergy? No, I don't believe so. Nothing that requires a doctor’s attention, at least. I've lived a long life without any major allergic reactions, thank you very much. It's likely I'm quite resilient. Is there anything else you need to know? This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. That's a rather broad question, isn't it? My father… well, he lived to a good age, I suppose. A bit of a heart condition, if I recall correctly. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, much like myself. But beyond that, I'm afraid my knowledge is rather limited. We weren't a family that kept detailed medical records, you understand. It was a simpler time. Honestly, I doubt any of it is terribly relevant. Is there anything else? I’m starting to feel rather lightheaded. Perhaps we should expedite this process.
DOCTOR: You mentioned feeling lightheaded. Have you experienced that before?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s nothing, Doctor. Just a momentary… lapse. Happens from time to time, as one gets older, you understand. Probably just didn't have enough breakfast. Or perhaps the air in here is a bit stuffy. It’s not a cause for concern, truly. Really, I'm quite robust for my age. But if you insist… it happened once or twice a few months back, but it passed quickly. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, I think I’m simply tired. All these questions… it’s rather draining.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor, is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, I’m in perfectly good health. But very well, if you insist. Be gentle, please. My knees aren't what they used to be. And do try to be quick about it. This is becoming rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is a little irregular, sir. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 145 over 90. I hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds. Reflexes are a bit diminished as well. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. Sir, I recommend we order some blood work and an EKG to investigate this further. We should also consider a referral to a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Blood work? An EKG? Good heavens, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m ill? I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s to be expected at my age. A slight murmur? Diminished breath sounds? That sounds like… nonsense, frankly. And swelling in my ankles? That’s simply the result of a long day, I assure you. Honestly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I’ve lived a long and healthy life, and I don’t need to be subjected to a battery of tests. I think I’ll get a second opinion. This is all rather upsetting. .
DOCTOR: Sir, I understand your concerns, but I am obligated to investigate these findings. It's better to be safe. I can schedule these tests for you, and we can discuss the results. Given your dizziness and the irregularities I've found, I would advise against driving until we have more information. .
