DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I am Dr. Jules. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… well, it’s this pain, you see. In my lower stomach. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite severe. I believe that’s what prompted the visit. Though, truthfully, sometimes it’s hard to keep track of what exactly is happening when it flares up. It’s been…a while, and things tend to blur.
DOCTOR: "A while," you say. Well, that hardly narrows it down. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… yes. Well, I suppose the last really bad episode was… hmm. Perhaps a few weeks ago? Or was it last month? It's difficult. I've been told it has to do with… this lupus, isn't it? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus? It’s just… it feels different each time, and the timing… slips my mind. I apologize. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Lupus… Yes, I see that in your chart. It’s…not uncommon for symptoms to wax and wane. But “different each time” is not a helpful description, Ms. Glymph. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I understand. I wish I could be more precise! Hmm… sharp… sometimes, yes. A cramping sort of sharp. And other times… a dull ache, really. A heavy feeling, almost. It's… difficult to describe. It feels like a twisting, sometimes. Does that make any sense at all? I fear I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: “Twisting”… Well. Has anything in particular brought on these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. I haven’t noticed any particular trigger, not that I can recall. I eat fairly regularly, try to get my rest… though lately, sleep hasn't been the easiest thing. I do find that… when I’m stressed, it feels worse. But I'm always a little stressed, you see. So it’s hard to say if that’s the cause, or simply makes it feel that way. I apologize for my inability to give a definitive answer.
DOCTOR: Stress is hardly a diagnosis, Ms. Glymph. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I do feel rather tired, more often than not. And… sometimes I have a bit of a feverish feeling, though I haven’t taken my temperature recently to confirm it. Oh, and my joints ache, though that’s been… ongoing, really. It’s hard to distinguish what’s related to this pain, and what’s just… the usual. Is that helpful? I'm afraid I'm not very good at articulating things.
DOCTOR: "Ongoing" aches… and fatigue. Yes, well. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, dear. I… I suppose I’ve been a bit more regular than usual, if that makes sense. Not… drastic changes, though. Just… more frequent. And perhaps a little… looser than normal. But I wouldn’t say it’s caused any particular concern. I haven’t taken any medication for it, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s… just something I noticed. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It could be. I'm going to need to perform a quick abdominal exam, Ms. Glymph. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. An examination… perfectly fine. Relax… yes, I’ll try. Though, truthfully, examinations always make me a bit… anxious. But I’ll do my best. Please, proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. Right… there. Yes, that’s…tender. Not excruciating, but… certainly noticeable. It feels… a bit like a dull ache, spreading out. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s… worse when you press directly on that spot.
DOCTOR: And what about here?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not as bad. A little discomfort, yes, but not nearly as tender as that first spot. It’s more of a… pressure, really. A heavy feeling, rather than a sharp pain. It’s… difficult to explain. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It’s… possible you have some inflammation. I'm going to order some blood work, a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urine analysis. We’ll see what those results tell us. I also want to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Blood work… yes, of course. Anything to help. Inflammation, you say? Is that… serious? And “rule out anything more serious” sounds… rather alarming. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I am happy to comply. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: It's too early to be alarmed, Ms. Glymph. These tests are simply precautionary. The lab results should be back in a few days. The nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, if you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or any bleeding, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A few days… very well. High fever, severe pain, bleeding… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. And your patience, frankly. I do tend to be rather…scatterbrained, as they say. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions, perhaps? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity. Stay hydrated. And try to get some rest, Ms. Glymph. And frankly, try not to worry. It’s unlikely to be anything truly serious. The nurse will have instructions for the blood work when she calls to schedule your follow-up. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Thank you again for your time and attention. And for your… understanding. I do tend to overthink things, you see. You have been most helpful. I will await the nurse’s call. Have a pleasant day, Doctor Jules. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You too, Ms. Glymph. .
