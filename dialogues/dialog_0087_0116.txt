DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Soodeen, you say? A pretty name. Oh, my… well, it’s these legs of mine. They bother me something fierce at night. Cramping, you see. Just awful cramping. I don’t rightly recall when it started started, but it’s been… a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Leg cramping, primarily at night. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you describe the cramping for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. Well, it’s not a steady pain, you understand. It comes on suddenly. Like… like someone is tying a knot in my calf muscle. A tight knot. And it just… holds. I have to stretch it out, sometimes for a good long while, before it lets go. It wakes me up, usually. Makes it hard to sleep. I don't… I don't know what causes it. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Sudden onset, tight cramping in the calf, wakes you up at night. Does it happen in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Mostly the left one, I think. Though… sometimes the right one will join in. Not as often, mind you. But yes, both. It’s… unpredictable, really. I can't say for certain which one it’ll be. Or if it’ll be either one, to be honest. It’s just… a nuisance. A very painful nuisance, but a nuisance all the same.
DOCTOR: Alright, both legs, but more frequently the left. And unpredictable in terms of when it occurs. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the cramping?
PATIENT: Trigger? Oh dear… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t… I don’t believe so. I haven’t been able to find anything that makes it more likely to happen. I try to keep my feet warm, that’s about all. And I don't walk as much as I used to. But I don’t think that’s got anything to do with it. I mostly just… live quietly these days. I don't do a lot of strenuous things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no identified triggers, and you try to keep your feet warm. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical problems – things like diabetes, heart trouble, kidney issues?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a lot of questions. Well, let me see… The doctor, Dr. Abernathy, he passed on a few years back now… he said my blood pressure was a little high sometimes, but he put me on a little white pill. I took it for a while, but I… I can’t rightly remember if I still do. And my knees… they bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Nothing serious. As for the rest… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, all things considered. Though, these legs… they’re a new problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of hypertension – you mentioned a white pill, do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. I wouldn’t have the faintest idea. I just took what he gave me. A little white pill. That's all I remember. Small, round, white pill. I’m sorry, dear. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s just… gone to pieces, I suppose. I used to be so good with remembering things. Now… well, now I forget where I put my glasses half the time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can often figure things out later. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about everything. Though, I don't care much for beets. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a dislike. No, I don’t have any allergies. I’m quite fortunate, really. I’ve always been… a sturdy woman.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the white pill for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just… just a little vitamin D in the winter. Dr. Abernathy said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. But that’s all. Just a little one. Nothing fancy. And like I said, I don't even know if I still take the blood pressure pill. It might be in the cabinet, but I haven’t looked in a while. I mostly just take things as I remember them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few questions about your history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. Oh, a long time ago. When I was a young woman, I had my tonsils out. And when I had my children, of course. That was a long time ago, though. Before your time, I’m sure. Other than that… no. Never been much for hospitals. I prefer to stay home, if I can.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don't believe so. Just the tonsils. My mother always said I was lucky to be so healthy. She said I had a strong constitution. Now, she had a bad gallbladder, though. Poor woman. Had to have it taken out. But me? No. Just the tonsils. Nothing else. I've been very fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have a family history of any significant medical problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s… a hard one. My mother, she passed away when I was young, from… from a weak heart, I think. My father, he lived to be a very old man. A very sturdy man, like me. He didn’t have any… trouble, that I recall. My brother… he had some trouble with his breathing, towards the end. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t rightly remember what it was. It's all a bit hazy, dear. I apologize. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’ve covered a lot. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your legs and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… sensible. I always trust a doctor’s judgment. If you think it's best, then do what you need to do. I’ll just sit here, and try not to fidget too much. My legs… they’re not always the most cooperative. Go ahead, dear. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. I'm just going to feel your legs and check your pulses. Your pulses feel a bit weak in both feet, but not alarmingly so. There's some tenderness in your left calf muscle, particularly when I stretch it. No significant swelling or redness that I can see. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, though a little fast. Your lungs are clear. I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within the normal range for someone your age.
PATIENT: Diminished, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad? I always worry about things like that. My mother, she always said… well, never mind. What does it mean, doctor? Is something seriously wrong with my legs? I just want to be able to sleep at night. That's all.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Bilstein. Diminished reflexes can be common with age and decreased activity. It doesn’t automatically mean there’s a significant problem. However, given your symptoms of nighttime cramping and the diminished reflexes, I want to investigate a little further to rule out a few possibilities. One is peripheral artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries in the legs. Another is a possible vitamin deficiency. And we should also consider the possibility of restless legs syndrome. To start, I’d like to order a blood test to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. I’m also going to order an ankle-brachial index, which is a simple test to assess blood flow in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an ankle-what-you-call-it? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But… if it will help my legs, then yes. Do what you think is best, doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please don’t poke me too much with the needles. I always get a little faint. And… will these tests be expensive? I… I don’t have much money, you see. I’m a widow, and… well, things are tight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Bilstein. We’ll take it slow with the blood tests, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. As for the cost, I’ll have my staff check with the lab to see if there are any financial assistance programs available. We can also discuss which tests are absolutely essential to start with, to minimize the expense. The ankle-brachial index is a non-invasive test, doesn’t involve any needles, and is relatively inexpensive. We'll focus on getting you some relief, and we’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. First, I’m going to write the orders for the blood tests and the ankle-brachial index. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the process for the ankle-brachial index. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a mild stretching routine for your calves before bed, and make sure you stay well-hydrated throughout the day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… very kind of you, doctor. Very kind indeed. Stretching… I suppose I can manage that. And staying hydrated… yes, I can do that. My nurse will explain everything? That’s… good. I always feel better when someone explains things slowly. Yes. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Perhaps… perhaps my legs will feel better soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. We’ll do everything we can. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent at explaining things. She’ll be in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I don't believe so. Just my legs. And you're doing everything you can. I appreciate that. Truly, I do. It's… comforting, just knowing someone is listening. That’s all. Thank you again, doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. That's what I'm here for. Sarah will be in shortly. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Ms. Bilstein.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, doctor. Thank you again for your kindness. I feel… a little bit better already.
