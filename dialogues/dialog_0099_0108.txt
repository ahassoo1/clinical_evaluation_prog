DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood. Not a ton, thankfully, but enough to scare the bejesus outta me. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. It's… red, obviously. And kinda… chunky. Sorry to be graphic.
DOCTOR: "Chunky," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, chunky. Like… bits in it. Not smooth, if you catch my drift. Looked like… well, like what you'd expect if someone was, uh, not feeling good. I haven't been eating much, to be honest. Everything just feels… wrong. And I’m losing weight, which is the last thing I need.
DOCTOR: Right. “Chunky emesis with blood.” And you've noticed a decreased appetite and weight loss. How long would you say you’ve been experiencing this decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, probably a couple weeks now, easy. Maybe longer. It’s hard to keep track when you're not exactly enjoying your meals. Everything tastes…off. Like metal, sometimes. And I just don't feel hungry. Used to have a pretty good appetite, you know? Ate like a horse. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Metal taste, you say. Interesting. Any abdominal pain, nausea besides when you're vomiting?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… yeah, sometimes. Not sharp, more like a dull ache, mostly in my stomach. And the nausea? Constant. Feels like I’m seasick, even when I’m just sitting here. It’s not with the vomiting all the time, but it’s… always there, hanging around. Makes me wanna just lie down all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant nausea, dull abdominal pain. And how about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Don’t even get me started. Black. They're black. Like… tar. Scared me half to death, I’m tellin’ ya. Not normal, obviously. And… well, less of ‘em than usual. Used to be pretty regular, if you know what I mean. Now it’s… a struggle.
DOCTOR: Black, tarry stools… yes, that's concerning. Have you taken anything for this – antacids, anything at all?
PATIENT: Antacids? A little Tums here and there. Didn't really do much good, honestly. Thought maybe it was just heartburn at first. Now I know better. Tried some Pepto-Bismol once, but that just made me feel worse. I don’t really bother with that stuff much anymore. Waste of money, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant relief from over-the-counter medications. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No fever, not that I've noticed. I checked a couple times, just to be sure. Chills… maybe a little bit shaky sometimes, but I figured that was just from not eating. And no night sweats, thankfully. I sleep pretty warm as it is. I’m a hot-blooded guy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of stomach problems, ulcers, or bleeding?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… lemme think. My dad… he had some kinda stomach trouble when he got older. Vague stuff, I didn’t really pay attention. Lots of complaining, a lot of doctor visits. Never really knew what it was, to be honest. He wasn’t one to share details. Yemenis aren't big on talking about… personal things. And my mom… she was healthy as a horse until the day she died, bless her soul.
DOCTOR: Right. And your social history – do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I’m a practical man. Never been one for fancy habits. No drinking, no smoking, no… that stuff. Never saw the point. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. I work hard, I eat what I can, and I try to stay out of trouble. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been allergic to anything in my life, thankfully. Used to make my old boss mad, 'cause I'd eat whatever was around at the company picnic. He was always worried someone'd have a reaction. But me? I'm good. Strong stomach, usually. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Gentz, this all adds up to a concerning picture. We need to get some tests done to figure out what’s going on. I'm going to need to do a physical exam, and then I'll order some blood work and likely an endoscopy to look directly at your stomach and esophagus. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? Sounds… invasive. Look, doc, I'm not a fan of poking and prodding if it can be avoided. Is there… anything else we can do first? Blood work I can handle, but sticking a camera down my throat? That sounds… unpleasant. And expensive, I imagine. I don’t exactly have money to burn.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. It is invasive, and I wouldn’t recommend it if it wasn't necessary. However, given your symptoms – the vomiting blood, the black stools, the weight loss – it’s the best way to determine the cause. We need to rule out serious conditions like ulcers, bleeding varices, or even cancer. Blood work will give us some information, but it won't be definitive. And delaying a proper diagnosis could have serious consequences. As for the cost, we can discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs with the hospital billing department. I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make it manageable. But I strongly advise against postponing this further. Do you have any questions about the endoscopy procedure itself?
PATIENT: Ugh. Cancer. That’s what I figured. Always something. Look, I don't like being told what to do, doc, but I understand what you're saying. Serious conditions… can't ignore those. Fine. Do the blood work. And… schedule the camera thing. But I want it done as quickly as possible. And I want to know exactly how much this is gonna cost before you stick anything down my throat. Understand? And I don’t want a lot of extras tacked onto the bill, either. Just the essentials.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I will personally ensure you receive a detailed cost estimate before the endoscopy. We will only perform the essential tests and procedures. Now, let's start with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look for any signs of anemia. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But no funny business, doc. I've been around the block a few times. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but a little rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. Any discomfort here?
