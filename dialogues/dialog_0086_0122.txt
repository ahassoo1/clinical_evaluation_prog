DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I have been noticing…lapses. Small things, mostly. Forgetting where I put my keys, repeating questions. It worries me, because my blood pressure has been…not good. I wish to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Lapses, you say. And you attribute this to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. My husband…he passed three years ago. I manage many properties, you see. It is a great responsibility. But lately…the details slip. I remember everything that happened, precisely when, and to whom. But…simple things. Like the name of the new tenant on Elm Street. It is frustrating. I do not wish to be…incapable. Is that making sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Alvara, it does. So, these lapses are relatively new?
PATIENT: Relatively, yes. Perhaps…six months? It started slowly. I would misplace things, then find them immediately. Now…it is more frequent. And sometimes…I ask the same question twice in the same conversation, and I do not feel confused at the time. It is…unsettling. My doctor…the one who monitors my blood pressure…he suggested I come here, for a more…thorough look.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is your current blood pressure medication regimen?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I…do not recall the name. It is a small white pill. I take it twice a day. My husband always managed the medication. He knew everything. Now…I simply take what the pharmacy delivers. I apologize. I am usually so organized. Perhaps I should have written it down?
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it is crucial to know what medications you’re taking, especially when you’re experiencing memory issues. Honestly, relying on a pharmacy delivery without knowing the names is… concerning. Do you have any bottles with you today?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, you are quite right. It is foolish of me. No, I do not. I…I did not think. I came prepared to explain the problem, not to…provide a list. It is…embarrassing, to be so careless. I simply hoped you could…assist me in remembering. I have a good memory for dates, for faces…but names of pills…no. It is very frustrating. Perhaps I can call the pharmacy after this appointment? I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Alvara, but it complicates matters. We'll need to get that information somehow. In the meantime, let's try to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. No dizziness. No headaches. My vision is…fine, I believe. I do feel…tired, often. More so than before. But I attribute that to the…responsibility, and the worry. I sleep…well enough, I suppose. Perhaps six hours. Sometimes seven. I do not have trouble falling asleep. It is…staying asleep, sometimes. I wake up and…think about the properties, the tenants…the things that need to be done. Does that make sense? I wish I could be more…precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Changes in mood…no, not exactly. I am…sad, of course. My husband’s passing left a great emptiness. But I am usually…practical. I keep busy. I do not…allow myself to dwell. Perhaps a little more…irritable, lately. But I believe that is due to the forgetting. It is…unacceptable, to be so unreliable. I pride myself on my efficiency. It is…very upsetting. Is that what you mean, Doctor? Changes in mood?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, besides hypertension?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband always said I was…robust. Very healthy. He always worried about him, not me. Just…the blood pressure. It developed after he passed, I think. Stress, perhaps. No other illnesses. No surgeries. I’ve broken a bone, when I was a girl, but that is all. I apologize for being so…disorganized. I am usually very meticulous. This is…not like me. It frightens me, Doctor. To be losing control.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family…my mother had…heart trouble. When she was older. She died when I was young, so I do not recall many details. My father…he was very healthy. Lived to be eighty-five, I believe. No…dementia. No…mental illness. My brother…he has diabetes, but otherwise…healthy. Does that help, Doctor? I wish I had…written all of this down. I am so sorry. It feels like I am failing a test.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Alvara, but it does make things more difficult. Let's move on to your social history. Do you drink alcohol or smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband…he did, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner. But I…never. I do not like the taste. I do not like the smell. I do not have any…bad habits, Doctor. I eat well, usually. I keep busy. I walk, when the weather is nice. I volunteer at the community center, three times a week. I lead a very…structured life. I always have. It is…concerning, to feel so…unsettled. To be forgetting things. It is simply not me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs and do a basic neurological assessment. Please follow my instructions carefully. I need to check your reflexes and coordination. If you could just sit here for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will do my best. I hope I am not…too difficult. I am usually quite steady. But this…worry has me somewhat…distracted. Please tell me if I am doing something incorrectly.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, as expected. 160 over 95. Pulse is 80 and regular. Respiration is 16. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I need you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are smooth. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… August…the second. August 2nd. 2025, yes. I am certain of that. It is…written on my calendar. I always keep my calendar up-to-date. It helps me stay…organized. I hope I have answered correctly. I am trying very hard to be precise. It is…frightening, to feel so unsure of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me, and I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple…table…penny. Apple, table, penny. I have remembered them. I hope I will remember them later. I am concentrating very hard. It is…difficult to explain. It is not that I cannot remember. It is that the memories…feel distant. Like looking at a photograph. I know I can recall them, but it requires…effort. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. One hundred… ninety-three…eighty-six…seventy-nine… seventy-two… Sixty-five… Um… I… I seem to be losing track. I apologize. I am usually very good with numbers. It is…most unsettling. It feels as if my mind is…foggy. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. That's enough for now. Given your symptoms - memory lapses, difficulty with concentration, and elevated blood pressure - there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to hypertension, but it could also indicate early cognitive impairment, or another underlying issue. We need to rule out other causes. I am ordering a comprehensive blood panel, including thyroid function tests and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI… That sounds…serious, Doctor. Are you saying there is something…wrong? I simply thought it was the blood pressure. Is it…bad? I have always taken such pride in my health. To think… something could be wrong… It frightens me greatly. What do you…recommend? Besides the MRI, of course. I will do whatever you advise, but… what are we looking for, precisely?
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it is not helpful to jump to conclusions. We are conducting these tests to rule things out, not to confirm a diagnosis. The MRI will help us assess the brain structure and identify any potential issues, such as small strokes or areas of inflammation. As for a plan, I recommend strict blood pressure control, including lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medication adjustments. We also need to address your memory lapses. I suggest you start keeping a detailed daily journal to track your activities and any instances of forgetfulness. And, frankly, you need to get help managing your medication. Perhaps a family member or friend can assist you. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a formal cognitive assessment. This is not a quick fix, Ms. Alvara. It will require a concerted effort and close monitoring.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You are quite right. I…I have been foolish. Relying on the pharmacy, not managing my medication… it was irresponsible of me. I will…ask my neighbor. She is a retired nurse. And I will start a journal immediately. And the neurologist…of course. Whatever you advise. I simply want… to be myself again. To be capable, reliable… to be in control. I apologize for being so…difficult. I simply… fear the unknown. Is there…anything else I should be doing? Besides the journal and the medication? Anything to…help my memory?
DOCTOR: Aside from the journal and medication management, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle: regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. And engage in mentally stimulating activities – puzzles, reading, social interaction. But, and this is important, do not self-diagnose or spend hours worrying about the results. That will only exacerbate the anxiety. We'll gather the information, assess the situation, and develop a plan together. Now, I'll have my assistant schedule the necessary tests and the neurology appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is all, Doctor. Thank you for your…patience. And for your honesty. I will…do everything you advise. And I will try to remain…positive. Thank you again. Doctor…if you do not mind, may I ask…what is the…prognosis, generally? If it is related to my blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, the prognosis depends entirely on the severity of the hypertension and the extent of its impact on your cognitive function. If it's caught early and managed effectively with lifestyle changes and medication, we can often prevent further deterioration and improve your quality of life. However, if left untreated, it can lead to vascular dementia or other cognitive impairments. But we are not at that point. We’re taking the necessary steps to evaluate and address your concerns. Focus on what you can control: your lifestyle, your medication adherence, and your overall well-being. Now, let's get those tests scheduled. My assistant will be right with you. .
PATIENT: .
