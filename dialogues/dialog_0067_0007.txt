DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It is…painful. That is why I am here. I want to get this over with quickly, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya, we’ll get this sorted out as efficiently as we can. Could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It is…in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started…well, I believe it was around the first week of July. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s a sharp ache. It makes it hard to…work. I erect fences, you see. It is…physical work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain that started around the first week of July, comes and goes, and is described as a sharp ache. And it’s interfering with your work as a fence erector. That helps me understand things a bit. Can you tell me a bit more about how it interferes?
PATIENT: It…makes it difficult to bend. And lifting…forget it. Even walking for long periods can bring it on. I have to take breaks often. It is…slowing everything down. I used to be able to put up a whole section in a day, now…it takes me two, sometimes three. It is frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be very frustrating, especially when it’s impacting your ability to do your work. Is the pain constant, even when it’s mild, or does it only appear with certain movements?
PATIENT: It is not constant, no. When I am sitting still, or lying down, it is mostly gone. It is when I move…when I am using my back that it flares up. It’s…a quick, stabbing pain when I bend wrong. Then it turns into a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s triggered by movement, particularly bending, and transitions from a sharp, stabbing pain to a dull ache. Have you noticed anything that helps relieve the pain, like certain positions, or heat or cold?
PATIENT: Heat. Yes, definitely heat. A warm bath helps some. And…lying flat on my back, with a pillow under my knees. That takes some of the pressure off. But it does not last long. I have tried…those cold packs, but they do not seem to do much good. They feel…uncomfortable, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat and lying flat with a pillow under your knees provide some relief. And cold packs don't seem to help. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other areas of your body, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. My legs and feet are…fine. No tingling, no numbness, no weakness. I can walk normally, I can stand normally. It is just the back itself that is the problem. I…don't understand why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits, have you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything is…normal there. I apologize if that is…a strange question. It is just my back that bothers me. I want to get back to work, if that is possible. Is there something you can give me? Something to help with the pain?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, those are important questions to ask. Okay, so no changes in bowel or bladder habits, and it truly seems to be isolated to your lower back. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess the range of motion in your back and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. If it gets this over with faster, then yes, please. I have things to do. I hope it doesn't take long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It won't take long. If you could lie face down on the exam table for me, that would be great. I'll start by gently palpating your lower back to identify any areas of tenderness. I’ll also ask you to move your legs and back in a few different directions so I can check your range of motion. Okay, Lakiya, I'm gently pressing along your spine here… Do you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. Right…there. That is where it hurts. It is…a sharp pain when you press on it. Not all the time, but when you press hard enough. And…when I bend backwards, it really hurts. A stabbing pain. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting tenderness at the L4-L5 vertebral level on your right side. And you’re right, bending backwards does exacerbate the pain. Your range of motion is slightly limited in flexion and extension, but overall it seems pretty good. I'm not detecting any muscle spasms at this time. Okay, Lakiya, based on what you’ve told me and this exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain – a muscle or ligament injury in your lower back. It’s a common injury, especially with physically demanding work. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a disc issue, I'd like to get an X-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… I suppose so. If that is what you think is best, then yes. But I hope it does not take too long to get the results. I have work to do. I need to know what is wrong and how to fix it quickly. Is it covered by…Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the X-ray. We’ll verify that before we proceed, just to be certain. Okay, I’m checking your coverage now… Yes, it appears an X-ray is covered with your current plan. The X-ray will allow us to visualize the bones in your spine and rule out any fractures or other structural problems. It's a quick procedure – just a few seconds of exposure to radiation. We’ll get the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with the heat and lying flat with a pillow under your knees. I’m also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms, and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – an NSAID – to reduce inflammation. Would you like me to explain those medications in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Briefly. I do not need a long explanation. Just what they do and what I should watch out for. And…will they interfere with my work? I take nothing else, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. The muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, will help to calm the muscles in your lower back and reduce the spasms contributing to your pain. It can cause drowsiness, so it's best not to drive or operate heavy machinery while you’re taking it, especially initially. The NSAID, ibuprofen, will reduce the inflammation causing the pain and swelling. You should take it with food to avoid stomach upset. Since you're not taking any other medications, the risk of interactions is low. However, both medications can have side effects, so please let me know if you experience anything unusual, like severe stomach pain, dizziness, or a rash. And while the muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, the ibuprofen shouldn’t affect your ability to work, as long as you take it with food. We’ll get the X-ray done now, and then we’ll review the results when they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Let's get the X-ray done. I want to know what is wrong and get back to work. I have a schedule to keep. And…where do I go for the X-ray? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, in room 3. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes, including the paperwork and the actual scan. They will position you carefully and take a few images. They’ll explain the process to you as well. Once you've had the X-ray, just come back and find me. I'll be in my office. I’ll review the results with you as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss a more long-term plan for managing your back pain. Do you have any questions before you head down to room 3?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Just…room 3. I will go now. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate you trying to get this over with quickly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. I'm happy to help. Just let the technician know you’re here for an X-ray ordered by Dr. Pfennig. And please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions while you're waiting. I'll see you shortly.
