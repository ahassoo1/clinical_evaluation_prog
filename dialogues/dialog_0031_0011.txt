DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor… Rakosky, you say? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a… a paper signed. Something about… fixin’ myself up a little. Cosmetic, they called it. A young lady at the place said I needed your say-so. Don’t rightly recall all the details, to be honest. Been busy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. A form for a cosmetic procedure, you said. Let me see if I can locate the details in your chart… Ah, yes. It appears you scheduled a consultation with “Revive Aesthetics” for possible Botox injections and dermal fillers. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Botox… fillers… sounds familiar. Young lady was very insistent. Look, Doctor, I just want to know if you think it’s alright. I ain’t one for fussin’ over details. Just tell me yes or no. Less talkin’, more doin’, if you catch my drift. And I hope this doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg. I ain’t got insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Honcoop. However, I cannot simply approve a medical procedure without a proper assessment. Even cosmetic procedures carry risks, and my responsibility is to ensure your safety. To do that, I need to ask you a few questions about your medical history and why you’re considering these treatments. It’s not about fussing, it’s about responsible care. First, do you have any allergies to medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens to Betsy, no. Never had much trouble with nothin’. Dust, maybe. A little pollen in the spring. But medications? No. I take a little something for my… joints, sometimes. Old age, you know. But that’s all. Look, Doc, are you gonna ask a lot of questions or what? This is takin’ too long. And I still don’t know what this is gonna cost me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost, Mr. Honcoop. I assure you I'll be as efficient as possible. Knowing what you take for your joints is important, though. Could you please tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage you typically take?
PATIENT: Now you’re askin’ about… pills again? Honestly. It’s a little white one. Small. Doctor… I don’t remember the name. Old lady at the pharmacy gets it for me. Been takin’ it for… years. Maybe two. Don’t need to write all that down, do you? It’s just a little somethin’ for the ache. I told you, I ain't one for details. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I truly appreciate your patience. However, without knowing what medication you're taking, I cannot assess potential interactions with Botox or fillers. Even seemingly harmless medications can have unexpected effects when combined with other treatments. To proceed safely, I need to understand your complete medical history. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders, skin conditions, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Bleedin’? Auto… what now? Look, I come from a long line of… strong people. Farm folk. We worked hard, didn’t complain. Nobody ever had nothin’ fancy like… auto-immune. Just aches and pains. My mama… she had a bit of arthritis, I think. But that’s it. This is ridiculous. You're askin’ me about things I don’t even know about. Are you tryin’ to scare me away? I just want a little touch-up, that's all. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions. I assure you, I'm not trying to scare you, but I am obligated to ensure your safety. Given your difficulty recalling your medical history and the lack of insurance for specialist referrals, I'm becoming increasingly concerned about proceeding with these cosmetic procedures at this time. I strongly recommend that we schedule a consultation with a general practitioner to review your overall health and medication list before considering any elective treatments. Would you be open to that?
